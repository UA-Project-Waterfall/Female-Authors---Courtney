Data processing. BURROUGHS CORP. 3 March, 1969, No. 11320/69. Heading G4A. A modular data processing system comprises a plurality of input/output control modules connected to peripheral devices and a plurality of computing modules, the modules of each type being individually connected to each of a plurality of high speed memory modules, each input/output control module including a pair of identical input/output control units and a memory communication unit selectively connected to each of the pair to enable each of the pair to individually communicate with each of the memory modules on an alternate basis while the pair are simultaneously communicating with a pair of the peripheral devices. Main memory (core) modules can communicate via a central exchange with computer modules and I/O control modules and the latter can communicate via an I/O exchange with I/O devices. Each computer module utilizes instruction overlap and includes a local thin-film memory of 128 one-word registers (Figs. 13A, 13B, not shown, give register uses). Input - output details.-Each I/O control module includes two identical I/O control units which communicate with main memory via a common main memory interface unit including a one-word communications buffer and address registers, and communicate with peripherals for input via a common input device interface unit, and communicate with peripherals for output via a common output device interface unit. Each I/O control unit includes a one-word information register, a two-character buffer and a one-character output buffer arranged in series with each other (but transfer is parallel-by-bit) permitting operation overlap, and also includes a character counter and a descriptor register. A computer module initiates I/O by causing a main memory module to send a sequence of release, set-up, and command descriptors to an I/O control module which will eventually send a result descriptor back (Fig. 7, not shown, gives the descriptor formats). Transfer of instruction, control and status signals between I/O control module and peripheral is described in detail. Interrupt.-Error, I/O and other interrupts (Fig. 5, not shown) to a given computer module, with the exception of the two highest-priority types, set respective stages in an interrupt register to initiate a respective interrupt routine in a first control mode. An error interrupt occurring while this routine is being executed causes initiation of a respective interrupt routine in a second control mode. An error interrupt during this causes halting of the computer module. Completion of an interrupt routine in either control mode causes return to the original programme in the normal mode, using information saved in the thin-film memory, which also provided base addresses for first and second control mode tables in (different) main memory modules. Each table gives the starting addresses of the interrupt routines used in the respective control mode. Some stages of the interrupt register can be masked by respective groups of one or more bits in a mask register.",BURROUGHS CORP,FRESH WALTER CHARLES;;THOMPSON BLAIR CHESTER;;BEERS LEROY WALTER;;MURTAUGH JAMES LEO,,https://lens.org/145-645-790-935-229,Granted Patent,no,0,0,7,7,0,G06F9/4812;;G06F11/0709;;G06F11/0745;;G06F11/0751;;G06F13/00;;G06F13/122;;G06F13/18;;G06F13/24;;G06F15/16;;G06F9/4812;;G06F11/0751;;G06F13/122;;G06F11/0709;;G06F13/00;;G06F13/24;;G06F15/16;;G06F11/0745;;G06F13/18,G06F9/48;;G06F11/07;;G06F13/00;;G06F13/12;;G06F13/18;;G06F13/24;;G06F15/16,G4A AFG           FG;;G4A AFGDX         FGDX;;G4A AFI           FI;;G4A AMP           MP;;G4A A1F           A1F;;G4A A1F           FG;;G4A A1F           FI;;G4A A1F           MP;;G4A A12C          A1F;;G4A A12N          A1F;;G4A A12N          FG;;G4A A12N          FI;;G4A A12N          MP;;G4A A12P          A1F;;G4A A12P          FG;;G4A A12P          FI;;G4A A12P          MP;;G4A A13E          A1F;;G4A A13E          FG;;G4A A13E          FI;;G4A A13E          MP;;G4A A13M          A1F;;G4A A13M          FG;;G4A A13M          FI;;G4A A13M          MP;;G4A A15A2         A1F;;G4A A15A2         FG;;G4A A15A2         MP;;G4A A16D          A1F;;G4A A16D          FG;;G4A A16D          FI;;G4A A16D          MP;;G4A A16EY         A1F;;G4A A16EY         FG;;G4A A16EY         FI;;G4A A16EY         MP;;G4A A16E2         A1F;;G4A A16E2         FG;;G4A A16E2         FI;;G4A A16E2         MP;;G4A A16E3         A1F;;G4A A16E3         FG;;G4A A16E3         FI;;G4A A16E3         MP;;G4A A16F          A1F;;G4A A16F          FG;;G4A A16F          FI;;G4A A16G          A1F;;G4A A16G          FG;;G4A A16G          FI;;G4A A16G          MP;;G4A A16H          A1F;;G4A A16H          FG;;G4A A16H          FI;;G4A A16H          MP;;G4A A16J          A1F;;G4A A16J          FG;;G4A A16J          FI;;G4A A16J          MP;;G4A A2AY          A1F;;G4A A2AY          FG;;G4A A2AY          FI;;G4A A2AY          MP;;G4A A2BY          A1F;;G4A A2BY          FG;;G4A A2BY          FI;;G4A A2BY          MP;;G4A A2F11         A1F;;G4A A2F11         FG;;G4A A2F11         FI;;G4A A2F11         MP;;G4A A2F5          A1F;;G4A A2F5          FG;;G4A A2F5          FI;;G4A A2F5          MP;;G4A A2F6          A1F;;G4A A2F6          FG;;G4A A2F6          FI;;G4A A2F6          MP;;G4A A2G           A1F;;G4A A2G           FG;;G4A A2G           FI;;G4A A2G           MP;;G4A A3W2          A1F;;G4A A3W2          FG;;G4A A3W2          FI;;G4A A3W2          MP;;G4A A5A           A1F;;G4A A5A           FG;;G4A A5A           FI,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
