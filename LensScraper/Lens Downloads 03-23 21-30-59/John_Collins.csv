After storage of such radar returns, a like plurality of chirp pulses is produced, each one of such pulses having a dispersive time K.tau.. Synchronously with each one of the chirp pulses, one of the plurality of sets of stored radar returns is retrieved from the time compressor section, in a time duration equal to K.tau.. Each one of the retrieved sets of radar returns is mixed with a corresponding one of the plurality of chirp pulses to produce a series of mixed signals which is coupled to a pulse compressor. Each one of the mixed signals is compressed into a pulse occurring at a time related to the Doppler frequency of any object in the range cell producing such associated radar returns. The time compressor section is used prior to pulse compression to effectively ""match"" the radar dwell time, generally several milliseconds in duration, to the dispersive time of the chirp pulse, generally several microseconds in duration, thereby enabling the pulse compressor to include a practical surface acoustic wave (SAW) delay line. Further, the ""compressive"" bandwidth, .beta., of the pulse compressor is equal to, or greater than, the dispersive bandwidth of the chirp pulses, thereby to maximize the power in the compressed pulses.

SOLUTION: One main surface of a surface-roughened CVD diamond plate 10 is adhered with a titanium/copper/silver alloy layer 18, and a nickel layer 20 is arranged thereon. The obtained laminated body is heated to raise its temperature to 900 deg.C in a furnace, and the alloy is melted and adhered to the nickel layer, by which a bonding layer composed of the alloy layer/nickel layer is formed. Next, WC-Co powder is thermally sprayed on the exposed face at the outside of the nickel layer 20 at about 450 deg.C by an HVOF method to form a cemented carbide layer 16. By this method, the cemented carbide adhered ultra-hard material body unit free from layer peeling and cracks, furthermore high in adhesive strength and capable of easily brazing for the other substrate can be obtained without distorting the CVD diamond plate.",BEERS IND DIAMOND PTY LTD DE,COLLINS JOHN LLOYD,,https://lens.org/184-334-183-364-600,Patent Application,no,0,2,8,8,0,C04B41/009;;C04B41/009;;C23C4/10;;C04B41/52;;C04B41/52;;C04B41/89;;C04B41/89;;C23C4/02;;C23C4/02;;C23C30/005;;C23C30/005,C22C29/08;;C04B41/52;;C04B41/89;;C23C4/02;;C23C4/04;;C23C4/10;;C23C4/12;;C23C30/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

In a pressure measuring apparatus a pressure difference between the faces of a peripherally mounted diaphragm causes it to stretch, thereby altering its natural frequency of vibration which is measured. Diaphragm vibrations may be picked up by a microphone or detected capacitively, amplified and fed back to a diaphragm-actuating electromagnet and measured by a frequency meter. As shown (Figs. 1, 4) a diaphragm 1 of magnetic material such as steel is machined integrally with a casing 2 into which fits a unit 22 comprising a base plate 3 carrying a cylinder 4 of insulating material on the end of which is a copper plate 5 forming with the diaphragm 1 a capacitive pick-up and carrying an electromagnet 6. A pressure chamber 13 bolts on to the casing 2. Pick-up plate 5 is connected to amplifier 17 the output of which is fed back to electromagnet 6, lead 11 earthing the casing through a shim 12, causing the amplifier to oscillate at a frequency which is measured by a recorder 18. By applying a second pressure through connection 16, differential pressure may be measured but because the diaphragm 1 is concave with respect to the chamber 13 the greater pressure must be applied through 15.

Therefore, when the primary drive is operational the secondary drive is not. However, when the primary drive fails, the relative rotational force between the first and second elements of the secondary drive increases to cause the secondary drive to become operational. In this way the secondary, or redundant, drive mechanism is prevented from operating during normal working of the primary drive without the need for brake units or any other additional electro-mechanical device, which would add mass to the actuator and would itself be capable of failure.

The sheet material may be rendered porous by mixing the granules of fluorocarbon resin, with or without a filler such as asbestos fibres or slate powder, with a soluble or volatile binder-which is leached out or otherwise removed after sheeting. Examples of binders are polymethyl methacrylate, which is afterwards volatilized by heating, and chalk subsequently dissolved out with dilute acid. Bonding may be effected by heat and pressure. If the sheet is apertured the holes 9, Fig. 9, may be coned or of dovetail shape to provide keys for the backing material 5. The sheet 8 may be shaped, for example to cup form as shown, before application of the backing, or the completed laminate may be shaped, e.g. into a bearing, bush or sleeve. Alternatively a porous fluorocarbon resin sheet or sheets 14, Fig. 7, may be applied to a ball joint member 11, or the similar shaped male member of a mould, and the backing material 13 injected into the joint socket 10 through an aperture in a closure member 15, or into the female member of the mould.",ENG PRODUCTIONS CLEVEDON LTD,COLLINS JOHN HENRY,,https://lens.org/029-867-931-102-852,Granted Patent,no,0,15,1,1,0,F16C11/0633;;F16C33/201,F16C11/06;;F16C33/20,B5S S17X;;B5S S17Y;;B5S S175;;B5S S192;;B5S S22X;;B5S S22Y;;B5S S242;;B5S S25X;;B5S S25Y;;B5S S250;;B5S S251;;B5S S252;;B5S S253;;B5S S27X;;B5S S270;;B5S S273;;B5S S28Y;;B5S S280;;B5S S281;;B5S S29Y;;B5S S297;;B5S S344;;B5S S346;;B5S S40X;;B5S S414;;B5S S55Y;;B5S S570;;B5S S582;;B5S S587;;B5S S589;;B5S S590;;B5S S596;;B5S S625;;B5S S670;;B5S S678;;B5S S679;;B5S S68X;;B5S S682;;B5S S69Y;;B5S S690;;B5S S695;;B5S S706;;B5S S707;;B5S S71X;;B5S S719;;B5S S74Y;;B5S S766;;B5S S800;;E2F FBM           FBM;;E2F FEB           FEB;;E2F F600          FBM;;E2F F600          FEB;;E2F F608          FBM;;E2F F657          FBM;;E2F F666          FBM;;E2F F667          FBM;;E2F F674          FEB,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Acid of e.g. 80 to 95% concentration is used, preferably with an equimolar proportion of the trialkyl borate. The reaction mixture is agitated and its temperature may initially be between the b.p. of the by-product alcohol and a level 50 DEG C. above it. The gel is dried at, say, 50 DEG to 140 DEG C., under sub-atmospheric pressure if desired. The reaction may be carried out in an inert solvent, e.g. the alcohol corresponding to the alkyl groups. The trialkyl borate can be formed in situ by reaction between boric acid and the appropriate alcohol, in which case the phosphoric acid is added after at least part of the boric acid has reacted. Specified borates are those containing 2 to 6 carbon atoms per alkyl group, e.g. tri-n-propyl, tri-isopropyl and tri-s-butyl borates.

Grinding and polishing. KINGSLAND ENGINEERING CO., Ltd. July 11, 1951 [July 11, 1950], No. 25021/52. Divided out of 692,869. Class 60. Apparatus for distributing polishing or like paste 35, Fig. 5, in cake-form to grinding, polishing, or the like discs 34 comprises a screwthreaded shaft 16, Fig. 1, that is'reciprocated longitudinally and rotated intermittently, and a slide 1 which engages the shaft 16 and supports the paste 35. The cake is held between jaws 3, 4 on the slide, the jaw 4 being urged by its supporting spring 7 to grip the cake. A handle 9 may be disengaged from a clip 12, 13 and pivoted about its axis 11 to disengage the jaw 4 by co-operation between a pin 10 on the handle and the spring 7. The slide 1 is mounted on the bars 2 and lead screw 16 of a carriage 2, 18, Fig. 2, that can be reciprocated to apply the cake 35 to the disc 34 and withdraw it therefrom, the bars sliding in bearings in the ends of a holder 19 having slots 32 by which it is fixed to the machine. The reciprocations are produced by a cam 22 rotated by a motor 20 driving through a reduction gearing 21, the cam being followed by a plate 23 attached to the member 18 of the carriage and bearing on the cam under the weight of the carriage and slide. The slide 1 is advanced along the carriage during each withdrawal thereof to compensate for wear of the cake by rotation of the screw 16 produced by the cam 22 as it rocks a bell-crank lever 25, 27, Fig. 1, having a pawl 24 driving a pawl-wheel 26 secured to the screw 16. A spring 28 returns the lever 25, 27 against a stop-screw 30 that can be adjusted to regulate the extent to which the screw 16 is turned to compensate for wear of the cake. The slide 1 engages the screw 16 by means of a half-nut, Fig. 4 (not shown), carried by a resilient member that can be deflected to disengage the nut and permit rapid adjustment of the slide. The bars 2 of the carriage may be protected by rubber sleeves (not shown), and the carriage may carry a stop-rod 38 to limit movement of the slide.",KINGSLAND ENGINEERING COMPANY,COLLINS JOHN HENRY,,https://lens.org/010-878-950-682-366,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B24B57/00,B24B57/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In one embodiment, each subarray consists of four layers stacked one on top of the other. The top layer defines an array of miniature reception horns. Secured to the top layer is a second layer which constitutes the short-circuit plate of the antenna array. The short-circuit plate contains a plurality of through holes disposed about the surface of the circuit plate to permit passage of pairs of cylindrically shaped probes. The two remaining layers constitute the first power dividing layer and the second power dividing layer, respectively. Each of the layers includes transmission line waveguides. The complete interior surface of the waveguides is coated with a metallic film and contains a number of spaced non-conductive supports for supporting a metallic conductor at the central location of the waveguide when the channel is viewed in cross-section. This arrangement creates a rectangular coaxial transmission line with the conductor forming the central conductor and the metallically coated channel forming the outer conductor. At the end of certain channels are the vertically extending, cylindrically shaped non-conductive probes. In a second embodiment, non-conductive strips with spaced supports carry the conductor. The probes are intengrally formed as part of the non-conductive strips. In still another embodiment, the probes of the first embodiment are replaced by conductive legs formed in the same plane as the metallic conductor.

Measuring fluid-flow electrically. GRAVINER (COLNBROOK) Ltd. Oct. 24, 1967 [Nov.2, 1966; May 13, 1967], No.49123/66. Heading G1N. The flow-rate of a fluid is measured by its cooling effect on the hot junction 8, Fig. 1, of a thermocouple 5, the junction 8 being periodically heated by positive pulses from an A. C. source 12, a diode 16 blocking all negative pulses, and a diode 24 preventing the positive pulses from reaching an amplifier 20 but passing the output of the thermocouple 5 during the periods between the positive pulses. A meter 22 reads the D.C. output of the amplifier indicating flow-rate, and may be replaced Fig. 2 (not shown) by a feedback connection controlling the voltage output of a magnetic amplifier 30 constituting the A.C. source for the apparatus. A meter 22 then reads the current required to maintain the hot junction 8 temperature constant, and indicates flow-rate. The diode, 24 may be replaced by a capacitor 26 the thermocouple output being pulsed. Both junctions may be situated in the fluid provided they are not thermally influenced by one another. In a further embodiment Fig. 3 (not shown) the diode 24 is replaced by a diode (44) connected across the amplifier (20) to provide a low impedance feedback path for the leading pulses, which are therefore unable to pass to meter (22). The amplifier (20) output is made zero by manual adjustment of an autotransformer (32) in the A.C. source the wiper (34) of which is geared to that of a potentiometer (38) in a D.C. circuit containing a meter (41) calibrated to read fluidflow. The potentiometer (38) is preferably a square low device, and range-changing of the meter (22) is effected by a switch (48) actuated when the autotransformer wiper (34) reaches a certain position, the switch (48) either changing the D.C. voltage supplied to the measuring circuit, or switching in a resistor (50). Alternatively, a square low cam may be geared to the wiper (34) and have a follower operating an indicater. The wiper (34) is spring-biased to return to the minimum heating position to protect the thermocouple. The device may be used to check for hydraulic fluid leaks in an aircraft and a pluality thereof may be scanned.",GRAVINER COLNBROOK LTD,COLLINS JOHN BERTRAM,,https://lens.org/032-226-826-278-117,Granted Patent,no,0,1,3,4,0,G01F1/68;;G01F1/68;;G01F1/6888;;G01F1/6888;;G01F1/696;;G01F1/696;;G01P5/10;;G01P5/10,G01F1/68;;G01F1/688;;G01F1/696;;G01P5/10,G1N NABG          ABG;;G1N N1A3A         -;;G1N N1A3B         -;;G1N N1A3C1        -;;G1N N1A3C2        -;;G1N N1D4          -;;G1N N1M           -;;G1N N1P           -;;G1N N3S12         -;;G1N N3S14         -;;G1N N3S4          -;;G1N N4C           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Grinding and polishing. DAMIEN (LONDON), Ltd., M. July 11, 1951 [July 11, 1950], No. 17345/50. Class 60. An apparatus for distributing grinding, polishing or the like paste 3 in cake form to a grinding &c. disc 1 applies the cake to the disc intermittently by combined reciprocating and forward feed motions. The cake 3 is supported in a housing 4 carried by a frame 30 having bearings 16 for shafts 15 mounted in bearings 17 on a slide 18 that is adjustable on a carriage 19. The frame 30 is advanced along the shafts 15 to apply the cake 3 to the disc 1 of a polishing machine, such as described in Specification 692,870, by a cable H operated as the workpiece 32 is brought into operative relationship with the disc. The cable H is connected to a lever 13 pivoted at 38 to the frame 30. As the lever is rocked by the cable H against the influence of a spring 14, it causes rotation of a lever 10 connected to the lever 13 by spring-link 39, 42, 44. Further rocking of the lever 13, after it has contacted an edge 13'of the frame 30, causes the frame to be advanced against the action of a spring 25 acting between one of the bearings 16 and a part 26 on the end of one of the shafts 15. During the application of the polish to the disc 1. the frame 30 is rocked continuously on the shafts 15 by a cable H', Fig. 2, operated while the workpiece 32 is being rotated in contact with the disc. The cable H<SP>1</SP> is fixed to a bracket 24 on the slide 18 and oscillates the frame with the assistance of a spring 23, rocking motion being limited by an adjustable stop 37 on the slide. During withdrawal of the frame 30, effected by a spring 25, the rocking motion produced by the cable H' is stopped and the lever 10 returned by the spring 14. As the lever is returned, a pawl 34, Fig. 1, rotates a pawlwheel 8<SP>1</SP> and a sprocket 8, a further pawl 9 slipping to allow this rotation. A chain 6 is driven by the sprocket 8 to project the cake 3 from its housing 4 by moving a back-plate 33 attached to the chain. The plate 33 may be withdrawn by a handle 5, and the extent of each projection of the cake to compensate for wear may be adjusted by varying the position of the link 39, 42, 44 on the levers 10; 13. To compensate for wear of the disc 1, it is coupled (not shown) to a shaft on which a pinion 21 is mounted freely. This pinion meshes with a fixed rack 22 and a rack 20 on the carriage 19 so that any adjustment of the spindle 1<SP>1</SP> of the wheel 1 produces an adjustment of the carriage 19 of twice the extent of the adjustment of the wheel.",MAURICE DAMIEN LONDON LTD,COLLINS JOHN HENRY,,https://lens.org/057-144-539-861-615,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,B24B57/04,B24B57/04,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Class 135. A fluid-actuated two-, three-, or four-way valve has a valve member 36, with coned seats 30, 40 for engagement, e.g. with fixed seatings 32, 38, controlling communication between an inlet 18 and two outlets 20, 22 in the case of a three-way valve, and the valve-member 36 is carried on a stem 34 which projects outside the valve housing through a packed gland 44 and guide-plate 58, to be connected to a diaphragmactuated piston 68 through a self-aligning extension comprising a rod 74 screwed to an adaptor 94, which latter has a ball-and-socket connection 95 with the piston 68, relative rotation therebetween being prevented by ribs 98 on the ball engaging grooves in the socket. Such ribbed connection permits the adaptor 94 and piston 68 to be screwed as an assembly on to the rod 74 after the latter has been attached to the valve stem 34 by a further ball-and-socket connection 79, the screw connection being then locked by a nut 100, reached through a screw-plugged hole 104 in the piston 68. Fluid pressure applied at 72 to a diaphragm 64 depresses the valve 36 on to the lower seating 32, in opposition to a helical spring 59 surrounding the extension 94, and raising the valve on to its upper seating 38. The lower valve seating 32 is attached to the housing by a screwed flanged ring C, which applied pressure to lapped sealing faces 109 which prevent access to the screw thread of any solidified chemical material which may accumulate in a cylindrical clearance 108 which is made too wide to be bridged by such material which cannot therefore interfere with removal of either the screwed ring or the seating.",INT BASIC ECONOMY CORP,COLLINS JOHN ELDRIDGE,,https://lens.org/006-273-099-229-704,Granted Patent,no,0,11,1,1,0,F16K31/1262,F16K31/126,F2V VW60          VW60,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

DAMIEN (LONDON), Ltd., M. July 11, 1951 [July 11, 1950], No. 23736/52. Divided out of 692,870. Class 60 A grinding or polishing machine comprises a fixedly-mounted frame 1, Fig. 1, supporting a rotatable polishing disc 8, and a pivotallymounted frame 2 adapted to be oscillated towards and away from the frame 1, the frame 2 including shaft 22, Fig. 3, for holding a workpiece 25, such as an aluminium saucepan, and means for rotating the shaft about its axis and effecting axial reciprocations thereof simultaneously. A mandrel 24 on the end of the shaft 22 holds the workpiece in contact with the disc 8 which is rotated by an electric motor (not shown) housed in the casing 1 and may have its position adjusted for various sizes of workpiece by means of slides on the casing. A handlever 28 mounted on a tubular housing 17 for the shaft 22, is rocked to expand the mandrel into gripping engagement with the workpiece. The frame 2 is then rocked on its axles 4, 7, Fig. 1, into engagement with a stop rod 13 by a handlever 46 to engage the workpiece 25 and disc 8 against the action of a spring 14 on the rod, a spring-urged detent 15 engaging a member 16 retains the frame in this position.. As the frame 2 is rocked into the operative position, the clutch 37, Fig. 2, of an electric motor 31 housed in the frame 2 and driving through change-pulley 32, 34, a belt 33 and a reduction gearing 35 is engaged to effect rotation and axial reciprocation of the shaft 22. The clutch is operated by a bell-crank lever that engages a cam fixed to the base 3 of the machine. A spindle 38 supporting part of the clutch 37 rotates the shaft 22 through bevel gears 39, 40, 42, 23 and a flexible shaft 41. The shaft 22, Fig. 3, is reciprocated with its housing 17 in bearings 18, 19 by a pin 62 mounted eccentrically on a disc 53 and traversing a slot in a collar 51 fixed to the housing 17, bevel gears 61. 55 and a chain gear 58, 60 coupling the disc 53 to the spindle 38. The workpiece 25 is rocked away from the polishing disc, disengaging the clutch, when one of the abutments on a disc 69 rotated by bevel gears, 54, 56 releases the detent 15 from engagement with the member 16.",MAURICE DAMIEN LONDON LTD,COLLINS JOHN HENRY,,https://lens.org/192-550-875-960-16X,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,B24B5/04,B24B5/04,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Parcelling.-A machine is employed which automatically binds a string twice round the parcel and secures its ends by pinching them between U-shaped metal clips. The article is placed in the position shown in dotted lines on the table 1, 7, Fig. 1, and the loose end of a ball of thread 12 carried on an arm 10 is secured in a clip 65 on a wheel 63. The arm is rotated by a toothed sector 30 actuated by a foot-lever and driving a pinion 8 which gears with the arm through ratchet gear 20, 21. The arm makes two revolutions. The arrangement of the cord is shown in Fig. 15. Its end is secured in the right-hand clip 65, and its starting part is guided on the second revolution by a lever 77 with the left-hand clip. A metal clip in the jaws 86 is then moved forward, and the jaws are closed to squeeze the clip and then recede. The standing part of the string is next severed by a knife on the lever 77, and the parcel can be removed. The wheel carrying the clips 65 is then moved through 60‹ to the right, Fig. 15, and the machine is ready for another parcel. The jaws 86 are corrugated so as to crimp the clip. The whole of the operations are effected by one foot lever 37, which is supported by a spring. If it is desired to bind the parcel in both directions and use only one clip, the parcel is turned through a right-angle after the string has been passed round it once. The clips are contained between tapes wound in a spiral and mounted on a balanced lever. The tapes are unwound by a weight.",COLLINS JOHN CLAY,COLLINS JOHN CLAY,,https://lens.org/132-095-972-060-480,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Dual-frequency carrier phase and pseudorange measurements from GPS receivers are processed by specifying separate oscillator parameters for the carrier phase and pseudorange measurements. Carrier phase estimates of errors of the oscillator are arbitrarily biased with respect to the pseudorange estimates, and ambiguity parameters are constrained to be integer-valued. Isolating the ambiguities as integer valued parameters provides extra information that can be exploited to maximize the use of GPS and other Global Navigation Satellite Systems.",CA MINISTER NATURAL RESOURCES,COLLINS JOHN PAUL,HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF CANADA AS REPRESENTED BY THE MINISTER OF NATURAL RESOURCES (2008-12-18),https://lens.org/179-115-396-284-857,Patent Application,yes,25,36,2,2,0,G01S19/44;;G01S19/44,G01S5/14,342/357.04,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The pump shaft (19) is rotatably supported on a bearing assembly (21). A seal assembly (31) is provided between the pump casing (11) and the bearing assembly (21). The seal assembly (31) comprises a seal casing (33) attached to the bearing housing (21). A shaft sleeve (61) is mounted on the end section of the pump shaft (19) adjacent the impeller (15) for rotation therewith. The seal assembly (31) comprises a first seal (91), a second seal (92) and a seal chamber (93) therebetween. The first seal (91) is at the atmospheric end of the seal chamber (93) and the second seal (92) is at the fluid end of the seal chamber so as to be exposed to the pump chamber (13). The first seal (91) is in the form of a mechanical seal comprising a stationary seal element configured as a stationary seal ring (95) and a rotatable seal element configured as a rotatable seal ring (97). The second seal (92) comprises a lip seal (121) having a tip (25) for contact with the outer surface of the shaft sleeve (61). An inlet (141) is provided in the seal casing (33) to deliver flush fluid into the seal chamber (93). The flush fluid establishes a fluid pressure within the seal chamber (93) at a level slightly higher than the fluid pressure within the pump chamber (13), creating a pressure differential across the lip seal (121). As a consequence of the fluid pressure differential, there is restricted fluid flow (leakage) past the lip seal (121) from the seal chamber (93) into the pump chamber (13). The flush fluid serves to isolate the lip seal (12)1 from pumpage material being pumped within the pump chamber (13).",APC COMPANY PTY LTD;;COLLINS ANDREW PHILIP JOHN,COLLINS ANDREW PHILIP JOHN,,https://lens.org/194-976-430-971-262,Patent Application,yes,4,12,2,2,0,F16J15/36;;F04D29/106;;F04D29/126,F16J15/32;;F04D7/04;;F04D29/10;;F04D29/12;;F16J15/16;;F16J15/26,,1,0,,,"DATABASE WPI Week 199521, Derwent World Patents Index; Class A88, AN 1995-161872",PENDING

Pulse widths may be measured by monitoring the output of counters (20) incremented by a fast clock for the duration of each pulse, and the pulse widths are compared by comparing counter outputs stored in a memory (28) using a microprocessor (26).

Puzzles.-Two arrow or other shaped pieces c, g, preferably sheet-metal stampings, are provided with four lateral projections e, e<1>, e<2>, e<3>, at the head end, and six lateral projections f, f<1>, f<2>, f<3>, f<4>, f<5> at the feathered end, the arrow c being plain, while the arrow g has a slot h of a width slightly greater than the thickness of the plain arrow. The puzzle is to make these arrows intersect in an H-shaped slot in a piece a, preferably a heartshaped sheet-metal stamping. The feathers only, and not the head of the plain arrow, can be worked through the slot in the heart. In operation, these feathers are first worked through the slot by a zig-zag motion, until the feathers nearest the head are reached, when the arrow is turned into one or other of the recesses b<1>, b<2> or b<3>, b'. The slotted arrow is now worked into the other recess, with its head and feathers on opposite sides of the heart. The plain arrow is then worked backwards until half of it is on either side of the heart, when its head is slipped through the slot h into the final position shown in Fig. 6. In a modification, in which the arrows have only two lateral head projections, the slotted arrow is made so that its head can first be passed through the slot in the piece a, after which the plain arrow is worked into position.",COLLINS REUBEN JOHN COOPER,COLLINS REUBEN JOHN COOPER,,https://lens.org/044-715-403-623-399,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The pump shaft (19) is rotatably supported on a bearing assembly (21). A seal assembly (31) is provided between the pump casing (11) and the bearing assembly (21). The seal assembly (31) comprises a seal casing (33) attached to the bearing housing (21). A shaft sleeve (61) is mounted on the end section of the pump shaft (19) adjacent the impeller (15) for rotation therewith. The seal assembly (31) comprises a first seal (91), a second seal (92) and a seal chamber (93) therebetween. The first seal (91) is at the atmospheric end of the seal chamber (93) and the second seal (92) is at the fluid end of the seal chamber so as to be exposed to the pump chamber (13). The first seal (91) is in the form of a mechanical seal comprising a stationary seal element configured as a stationary seal ring (95) and a rotatable seal element configured as a rotatable seal ring (97). The second seal (92) comprises a lip seal (121) having a tip (25) for contact with the outer surface of the shaft sleeve (61). An inlet (141) is provided in the seal casing (33) to deliver flush fluid into the seal chamber (93). The flush fluid establishes a fluid pressure within the seal chamber (93) at a level slightly higher than the fluid pressure within the pump chamber (13), creating a pressure differential across the lip seal (121). As a consequence of the fluid pressure differential, there is restricted fluid flow (leakage) past the lip seal (121) from the seal chamber (93) into the pump chamber (13). The flush fluid serves to isolate the lip seal (12)1 from pumpage material being pumped within the pump chamber (13).
