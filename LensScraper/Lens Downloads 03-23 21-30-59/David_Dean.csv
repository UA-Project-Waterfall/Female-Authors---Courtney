The specified location or platform is within a range less than a predetermined maximum object distance. The laser scanner includes a waveform generator that generates a predetermined reference waveform to an analog laser that provides an modulated laser beam responsive to the reference waveform, an optical scanning system which 1) transmits and scans the object with the modulated laser light beam and 2) includes a means for receiving reflected the modulated laser light from the surface of an object on the platform or specified location, an avalanche photo-detector positioned to receive the processed modulated light from the optical processing system, and convert energy in the incident light into an amplitude-modulated range signal, a mixer is provided to down-convert the frequency of the range signal into a lower (LF) frequency. In practice, a first electrical circuit receives the down-converted range signal and converts it into a converted waveform that has a sinusoidal wave falling and rising that correspond to the zero crossings. The reference waveform is also applied to a mixer that down-converts it to the LF frequency. A second electrical circuit receives the down-converted reference waveform and converts it a second converted waveform that has a sinusoidal wave falling and rising that correspond to the zero crossings. A computer receives the first and second converted waveforms and outputs a highly accurate signal indicative of the time delay there between.

These restorations may be manufactured from ceramics, metals and polymers via subtractive means i.e. milling and grinding. A polar compact mechanism has been employed with the implementation of an inverse kinematic transform in the machine control to allow Cartesian programming. The margin following tool path is very computationally intensive and requires many minutes of calculation time and numerical control programs in excess of 10 mb for a typical restoration. Conventionally this would require the user to wait several minutes before running the machine which would increase the wait time for both the patient and the doctor.

These restorations may be manufactured from ceramics, metals and polymers via subtractive means i.e. milling and grinding. A polar compact mechanism has been employed with the implementation of an inverse kinematic transform in the machine control to allow Cartesian programming. The margin following tool path is very computationally intensive and requires many minutes of calculation time and numerical control programs in excess of 10 mb for a typical restoration. Conventionally this would require the user to wait several minutes before running the machine which would increase the wait time for both the patient and the doctor.

The arrangement permits inspection of a specimen subject to high temperatures. Both transducers may be focused to within the specimen and may be of similar type, or the receiving transducer may be coupled to the specimen by a liquid or may be a contact type as disclosed in Specification 1,118,141. Acoustic pulses with a carrier frequency at or near the natural vibration frequency of the transmitting transducer traverse the specimen and are detected by the receiving transducer, whose output is applied through a narrow-band amplifier to an analogue store (for subsequent analysis) and/or to a cathode-ray tube for display.

These customized data-handling scripts are resolved and called at runtime based on the annotations in the GraphQL SDL file. By enabling developers to define schema fragments in the SDL language and implement data-handling scripts in a suitable scripting language, schema portability can be maintained across client instances, as well as instance release versions. Additionally, the disclosed approach enables enhanced modularity and reuse of previously defined data types and data-handling scripts, which increases developer productivity and reduces errors during application development.",SERVICENOW INC,TAMJIDI DAVID;;SWOPE STUART DEAN,,https://lens.org/017-017-878-048-685,Granted Patent,yes,30,0,4,4,0,G06F16/2433;;G06F16/211;;G06F16/211;;G06F9/547;;G06F16/2433;;G06F16/2282,G06F16/21;;G06F9/54;;G06F16/22;;G06F16/242,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

If it is, and the relative velocities of the object and the system are such that a collision is likely, a warning buzzer (28) sounds.",SECR DEFENCE;;DEAN MICHAEL;;HODGES ROBERT DAVID,DEAN MICHAEL;;HODGES ROBERT DAVID,,https://lens.org/055-378-628-252-28X,Patent Application,yes,7,6,13,13,0,G01S7/032;;G01S13/34;;G01S13/87;;G01S13/931;;G01S7/2883;;G01S13/93;;G01S13/931;;G01S7/032;;G01S13/34;;G01S13/87;;G01S7/2883,G01S13/931;;G01S7/03;;G01S7/288;;G01S13/34;;G01S13/87,,2,0,,,"LISSEL E ET AL: ""RADAR SENSOR FOR CAR APPLICATIONS"", PROCEEDINGS OF THE VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE, STOCKHOLM, JUNE 8 - 10, 1994, vol. 1, 8 June 1994 (1994-06-08), INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS, pages 438 - 442, XP000496712;;STOVE A G: ""OBSTACLE DETECTION RADAR FOR CARS"", ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATION ENGINEERING JOURNAL, vol. 3, no. 5, 1 October 1991 (1991-10-01), pages 232 - 240, XP000265405",PATENTED

    Disclosed is are gene sequences encoding -tocopherol methyltransferases from photosynthetic organisms. The enzyme -tocopherol methyltransferase catalyzes the methylation of -tocopherol to yield -tocopherol, the most bioactive species of tocopherol. -tocopherol methyltransferase is believed to be involved in regulating the relative amounts of the various tocopherols present in photosynthetic organisms. By introducing a genetic construct having a -tocopherol methyltransferase coding sequence placed under the control of a plant promoter into a plant, transgenic plants can be made having altered -tocopherol methyltransferase expression, to effect dramatic changes in the tocopherol profile of the plant. Transgenic plants can be made that have -tocopherol as the predominant tocopherol in their seeds and oils.

   A defibrillation circuit generates a defibrillation pulse and includes a patient-parameter compensator that causes the pulse to have a predetermined characteristic regardless of the value of a patient parameter. For example, the circuit can generate defibrillation pulses that have a desired shape, decay rate, voltage level, current level, and/or energy level regardless of the patient impedance. Consequently, a defibrillator that includes the circuit is likely to be more effective than prior defibrillators in restoring normal heart rhythms to patients having an atypical value for a parameter such as impedance.

To generate the response signal, the actuator (13) includes a sensor excitation winding near the armature (1). Two sensor excitation windings (9, 11) can be provided, above and below the armature (1), to cancel out z components and thus allow for a variable gap. The sensor excitation winding or windings (9, 11) are supplied with an excitation signal to induce the response signal in the armature windings (15, 17). The response signal is derived by differentially amplifying and frequency filtering a raw output of the armature windings (15, 17). The response signal is demodulated to determine position. If a position controller rather than a mere sensor is desired, the position signal can be buffered, PID compensated, amplified, and fed back to the armature windings (15, 17).",NASA,ALHORN DEAN C;;HOWARD DAVID E,,https://lens.org/137-979-299-599-683,Patent Application,no,0,0,3,3,0,G01B7/003;;G01B7/14;;G01B7/003;;G01B7/14,G01B7/00;;G01B7/14,,0,0,,,,PENDING

   A ball dropping assembly for dropping an object such as a spherical ball into a wellbore. The assembly comprises a seat for retaining a ball before it is released, a ball retaining lever, and a shaft for turning the lever. In one embodiment, the assembly is attached to a side bore in fluid communication with a main bore in a cementing head. The ball-retaining lever has at least one finger which is rotated between a ball-retained position and a ball-released position. In the ball-retained position, the first finger is disposed in the entrance from the side bore to the main bore, thereby preventing the ball from entering the main bore of the cementing head. When the ball is ready for release, the lever is rotated in the direction of the main bore, thereby causing the second finger to urge the ball into the bore of the cementing head, and causing the first finger to protrude into the main bore. When a plug is released into the bore from the cementing head, the plug will trip the first finger, causing the ball-retaining lever to rotate back towards the ball-retained position. Thus, the ball dropping assembly also serves as a plug release indicator.

In the second mode, when the headland actuator is in a second position (e.g. retracted) and the implement is raised (e.g. at the headlands), the downward range of the implement wings is more limited (as compared with the first mode) at the point where the wing actuators are fully extended.

The coin cell battery, which is positioned in a stacking arrangement with the microprocessor, switch, and transmitter, allows the sensor to be of a significantly reduced size. Moreover, to provide long life despite a small battery, the microprocessor is run in a standby mode in which the microprocessor draws little power unless it actually samples the state of the sensor switch during select intervals. Various electronic components individually, or in combination, assist in the sampling (monitoring mode) in such a way as to reduce current consumption from the power source. The compact size makes the sensor ideally applicable for wireless intrusion systems embedded within hollow frames of windows and doors. Not only are such wireless sensors concealed and not readily seen by intruders, but the size allows the sensors to be installed within conventional sized window and door frames without piercing outer walls of the frames (thus avoiding nullification of window and door manufacturers' warranties).",ION DIGITAL LLP,SCHEBEL DEAN DAVID;;CARLSON JULIAN P,ROYNE INDUSTRIES LLC (2018-10-02);;ION DIGITAL LLP (2004-04-29),https://lens.org/179-407-669-674-186,Granted Patent,yes,27,30,2,2,0,G08B13/08;;G08B13/08,G08B13/08,340/545.6;;340/511;;340/545.7;;200/61.93,2,0,,,"Interactive Technologies, Inc., ""Recessed Micro Door/Window Sensor,"" May 2000.;;ADEMCO (Alarm Device Manufacturing Company, a division of Pittway Corporation, Syosset, NY), ""Installation Instructions for Recessed Transmitter"", Apr. 1998.",ACTIVE

A lens and an apodizer are placed in the physical space between the source zone and the test zone. The lens serves to collimate radiated energy emanating from the antenna toward the test zone. The lens may have a surface treatment, such as an anti-reflective coating or a surface pattern, on one or both surfaces. The apodizer functions to keep energy from diffracting off the edge of the lens and getting into the field of view (the test zone). The sensor or other device to be tested may be placed on a moveable mount to allow it to be moved, to simulate relative movement of the device and a radio frequency source, such as radiated by an antenna.",MARSHALL DEAN R;;KNAPP DAVID J,MARSHALL DEAN R;;KNAPP DAVID J,RAYTHEON COMPANY (2006-04-26),https://lens.org/168-235-392-152-977,Patent Application,yes,9,11,9,9,0,G01R29/105;;G01S7/4004;;H01Q15/02;;G01S7/4004;;G01R29/105;;H01Q15/02,H01Q15/02,343911 R,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
