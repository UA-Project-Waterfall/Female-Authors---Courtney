In a third way the valve may be opened and locked or latched to remain open allowing the deflation of the bladder. A spring provides a return force to close the valve when the lock is not engaged.

Clipping with optional clamping is performed using either interpolated depth values or calculated depth values, where calculated depth values are arbitrary depth values or modified depth values. Final depth values, used for depth testing, are selected from interpolated depth values and arbitrary depth values after clipping is performed.",NVIDIA CORP,ZATZ HAROLD ROBERT FELDMAN,NVIDIA CORPORATION (2003-02-24),https://lens.org/191-928-938-381-225,Granted Patent,yes,6,121,3,3,0,G06T15/005;;G06T15/005;;G06T15/30;;G06T15/30;;G06T15/40;;G06T15/40,G06T15/00;;G06T15/30;;G06T15/40,345/503;;345/422;;345/606;;345/614;;345/620;;345/506,5,2,008-112-842-005-332;;072-024-690-404-30X,10.21236/ada419652;;10.1145/199404.199414,"Proudfoot, K., Mark, W., Tzvetkov, S., and Hanrahan, P., ""A Real-Time Procedural Shading System for Programmable Graphic Hardware"", ACM SIGGRAPH 2001, pp. 159-170.*;;Lastra, A., Molnar, S., Olano, M., and Wang, Y., ""Real-Time Programmable Shading"", 1995 Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics, pp. 59-66.*;;Introduction to Shader Programming-Fundamentals of Vertex Shaders by Wolfgang Engel, modified Feb. 27, 2002; GameDev.net; http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1496.asp.;;Shader Programming-Part III: Fundamentals of Pixel Shaders by Wolfgang Engel; GameDev.net; http://www.gamedev.net/columns/hardcore/dxshader3.;;Introduction to Shader Programming-Part IV: Programming Pixel Shaders by Wolfgang F.

The stimuli(9) comprises a series of patterns which spatially vary according to a function of a family of orthogonal functions. Each pattern also varies temporally either by being flashed before the patient or by being reversed in contrast at a fixed frequency. An electroretinogram (ERG) or magnetoretinogram (MRG) response(13) of the patient's eye(5) to the series of patterns is fed back into a computer(7) generating the patterns. The responses are used by the computer(7) to determine the coefficients of the transform of the function of the retinal response. The computer(7) calculates the inverse transform associated with the orthogonal functions and provides the retinal response(17) as a function of position on the retina. Contrast, intensity and temporal frequency of the patterns are chosen for a linear response of the eye. Color, intensity and temporal frequency may also be chosen to test different retinal functions. A lock-in amplifier provides the computer(7) the signal amplitude and phase lag of the responses. A signal averager(15) provides the computer an improved signal to noise ratio of the responses.",RICHARDSON ROBERT W;;FELDMAN BARBARA M,RICHARDSON ROBERT W;;FELDMAN BARBARA M,,https://lens.org/075-571-998-041-236,Granted Patent,no,0,0,8,9,0,A61B3/12;;A61B5/398;;A61B3/12;;A61B5/398,A61B3/024;;A61B3/12;;A61B5/0496,D332600127   M,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The stimuli comprises a series of patterns which spatially vary according to a function of a family of orthogonal functions. Each pattern also varies temporally either by being flashed before the patient or by being reversed in contrast at a fixed frequency. An electroretinogram (ERG) or magnetoretinogram (MRG) response of the patient's eye to the series of patterns is fed back into a computer generating the patterns. The responses are used by the computer to determine the coefficients of the transform of the function of the retinal response. The computer calculates the inverse transform associated with the orthogonal functions and provides the retinal response as a function of position on the retina. Contrast, intensity and temporal frequency of the patterns are chosen for a linear response of the eye. Color, intensity and temporal frequency may also be chosen to test different retinal functions. A lock-in amplifier provides the computer the signal amplitude and phase lag of the responses. A signal averager provides the computer an improved signal to noise ratio of the responses.",RICHARDSON ROBERT W;;FELDMAN BARBARA M,RICHARDSON ROBERT W;;FELDMAN BARBARA M,,https://lens.org/021-742-821-951-685,Granted Patent,yes,0,40,8,9,0,A61B3/12;;A61B5/398;;A61B3/12;;A61B5/398,A61B3/024;;A61B3/12;;A61B5/0496,351/243;;351/246,16,16,015-962-836-545-37X;;062-838-697-858-179;;099-367-218-441-953;;063-881-577-496-142;;024-228-015-100-20X;;016-222-210-791-547;;019-514-185-992-825;;144-174-858-090-548;;009-898-670-430-52X;;001-100-359-914-162;;143-914-269-576-122;;104-289-790-792-808;;093-911-006-402-555;;013-083-993-481-118;;079-865-277-603-47X;;031-546-741-499-400,7353897;;10.1109/tbme.1980.326709;;1266072;;10.1016/0042-6989(76)90111-5;;10.1016/0013-4694(77)90033-5;;65262;;113932;;10.1016/0042-6989(79)90132-9;;10.1126/science.175.4027.1276;;5061252;;1193623;;10.1109/tbme.1975.324505;;3660650;;10.1016/0042-6989(87)90004-6;;10.1097/00006324-198601000-00001;;3942182;;6526100;;10.1159/000409816;;pmc1633723;;10.1113/jphysiol.1983.sp014794;;6620193;;pmc1195572;;10.1152/jn.1984.51.5.952;;6726320;;6869481;;10.1016/0002-9394(83)90457-9;;5858629;;10.1113/jphysiol.1965.sp007678;;pmc1357344;;10.1001/archopht.1977.04450070103009;;880081;;6709321;;10.1016/s0161-6420(84)34328-7;;507142;;10.1016/0002-9394(79)90669-x,"Koblasz et al, Wiener Kernels and Frequency Response Functions for the Human Retina , IEEE.

   A graphics subsystem having a programmable shader controllable by both state-based control information, such as DirectX 8 control information, and program instructions, such as DirectX 9 shader program instructions. The programmable shader translates state-based control information received from a host computer into native control information. The programmable shader translates into native control information program instructions fetched from memory locations identified by a received memory reference and program instructions received from the graphics subsystem. Native control information configures computation units of the programmable shader. The programmable shader optimizes the generated native control information by combining certain operations. The graphics subsystem detects memory references sent from the host computer and pre-fetches program instructions for transmission to the programmable shader. Native control information from multiple control sources is concurrently used in the programmable shader.

    A graphics subsystem having a programmable shader controllable by both state-based control information, such as DirectX 8 control information, and program instructions, such as DirectX 9 shader program instructions. The programmable shader translates state-based control information received from a host computer into native control information. The programmable shader translates into native control information program instructions fetched from memory locations identified by a received memory reference and program instructions received from the graphics subsystem. Native control information configures computation units of the programmable shader. The programmable shader optimizes the generated native control information by combining certain operations. The graphics subsystem detects memory references sent from the host computer and pre-fetches program instructions for transmission to the programmable shader. Native control information from multiple control sources is concurrently used in the programmable shader.

The gas, which may be a flue gas enters the laminar flow precipitator (102) through an inlet port (108) for passage through a charging section (104). The charging section (104) imparts a charge to the particulates carried by the flue gas. The flue gas and charged particles then flow to a collecting section (106) which is downstream and below the charging section (104). The collecting section (106) is formed by a plurality of substantially parallel tubular members, each tubular member defining a collecting passage therein. Each tubular member (118) is electrically coupled to a potential that is of opposite polarity to that imparted to the particulates, so as to attract the charged particulates to an inner surface thereof. The collected particulates are subsequently collected in a hopper (112) or reetrained in the gas stream as agglomerates for subsequent removal from the gas by a secondary filter, the gas stream then being conveyed to a stack (14) wherein the particulate-free gas can be emitted into the atmosphere.",ENVIRONMENTAL ELEMENTS CORP,KOHL ROBERT E;;FELDMAN PAUL L;;KUMAR KRISHNASWAMY S,ENVIRONMENTAL ELEMENTS CORP (1996-05-29);;CLYDE BERGEMANN US INC (2005-12-21);;MERCANTILE-SAFE DEPOSIT AND TRUST COMPANY (2000-06-30),https://lens.org/036-017-267-101-896,Granted Patent,yes,27,33,1,1,0,B03C3/06;;B03C3/36;;B03C3/53;;Y10S55/38;;B03C3/53;;B03C3/36;;B03C3/06,B03C3/06;;B03C3/36;;B03C3/53,96/45;;55/242;;X 55DIG  38;;96/47;;96/49;;96/52;;96/69;;96/94,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

SOLUTION: A WDM input signal received at an add/drop node is coupled onto both a 'drop' transmission path and a 'through' transmission path within the node. Optical channels to be dropped are then processed within the 'drop' path, such as by optical demultiplexing. Because a copy of the same WDM input signal is routed on the 'through' path, a dynamically configurable and programmable wavelength blocker selectively blocks the optical channels that are being dropped from the WDM input signal and passes through those optical channels not being dropped onto the 'through' path. In an 'add' path within the node, optical channels are selectively added, such as by using optical multiplexing.",LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES INC,CAROLI CARL A;;DOERR CHRISTOPHER RICHARD;;FELDMAN ROBERT D,,https://lens.org/086-725-882-654-960,Patent Application,no,0,13,5,5,0,H04J14/0204;;H04J14/0205;;H04J14/0206;;H04J14/0208;;H04J14/0209;;H04J14/021;;H04J14/0212;;H04J14/0213;;H04J14/0221;;H04J14/0204;;H04J14/0221;;H04J14/0212;;H04J14/0209;;H04J14/021;;H04J14/0213;;H04J14/0205;;H04J14/0206;;H04J14/0208,H04B10/27;;H04B10/278;;H04B10/29;;H04B10/291;;H04J14/00;;H04J14/02,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   Optical signal power levels for selected optical channels processed within an add/drop node in a wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) system are adjusted as a function of variations in signal power in an incoming WDM signal caused by gain ripple. In particular, a ripple fitting method is described whereby the optical signal power of individual optical channels being added at the add/drop node are adjusted to levels that correspond to the ripple profile of other optical channels being routed through the add/drop node. In this manner, the gain ripple in the WDM signal being output from the add/drop node approximately corresponds to the gain ripple in the incoming WDM signal at the node.

    Optical signal power levels for selected optical channels processed within an add/drop node in a wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) system are adjusted as a function of variations in signal power in an incoming WDM signal caused by gain ripple. In particular, a ripple fitting method is described whereby the optical signal power of individual optical channels being added at the add/drop node are adjusted to levels that correspond to the ripple profile of other optical channels being routed through the add/drop node. In this manner, the gain ripple in the WDM signal being output from the add/drop node approximately corresponds to the gain ripple in the incoming WDM signal at the node.

   A WDM input signal received at an add/drop node is coupled onto both a drop transmission path and a through transmission path within the node. Optical channels to be dropped are then processed within the drop path, such as by optical demultiplexing. Because a copy of the same WDM input signal is routed on the through path, a dynamically configurable and programmable wavelength blocker selectively blocks the optical channels that are being dropped from the WDM input signal and passes through those optical channels not being dropped onto the through path. In an add path within the node, optical channels are selectively added, such as by using optical multiplexing.

The circuitry removes from the AC side of the circuit a tuning capacitor and switch traditionally used to tune the tank circuitry to different frequencies for telemetry and charging. As such, the tank circuitry is simplified and contains no switchable components that can be difficult to implement. A switch is serially connected to the storage capacitor on the DC side of the circuit, which essentially takes the place of the switch of the prior art by tuning the circuit for telemetry or charging. During telemetry, the switch is opened, thus disconnecting the storage capacitor from the tank circuit, and alleviating concerns that this capacitor will couple to the tank circuit and interfere with telemetry operations. During charging, the switch is closed, which allows the storage capacitor to couple to the tank circuitry through the rectifier during some portions of the tank circuitry's resonance.",BOSTON SCIENT NEUROMODULATION,FELDMAN EMANUEL;;DRONOV VASILY;;PARRAMON JORDI;;OZAWA ROBERT;;RAHMAN MIZANUR,,https://lens.org/077-983-311-553-459,Patent Application,no,0,0,16,16,0,A61N1/3787;;A61N1/3787;;A61N1/37223;;H01F38/14;;H02J50/12;;H04Q9/12,A61N1/378;;A61N1/36,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The circuitry removes from the AC side of the circuit a tuning capacitor and switch traditionally used to tune the tank circuitry to different frequencies for telemetry and charging. As such, the tank circuitry is simplified and contains no switchable components that can be difficult to implement. A switch is serially connected to the storage capacitor on the DC side of the circuit, which essentially takes the place of the switch of the prior art by tuning the circuit for telemetry or charging. During telemetry, the switch is opened, thus disconnecting the storage capacitor from the tank circuit, and alleviating concerns that this capacitor will couple to the tank circuit and interfere with telemetry operations. During charging, the switch is closed, which allows the storage capacitor to couple to the tank circuitry through the rectifier during some portions of the tank circuitry's resonance.",BOSTON SCIENT NEUROMODULATION,FELDMAN EMANUEL;;DRONOV VASILY;;PARRAMON JORDI;;OZAWA ROBERT;;RAHMAN MIZANUR,,https://lens.org/020-976-938-266-644,Patent Application,no,0,0,16,16,0,A61N1/3787;;A61N1/3787;;A61N1/37223;;H01F38/14;;H02J50/12;;H04Q9/12,A61N1/378;;A61N1/36,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

As such, the tank circuitry is simplified and contains no switchable components that can be difficult to implement. A switch is serially connected to the storage capacitor on the DC side of the circuit, which essentially takes the place of the switch of the prior art by tuning the circuit for telemetry or charging. During telemetry, the switch is opened, thus disconnecting the storage capacitor from the tank circuit, and alleviating concerns that this capacitor will couple to the tank circuit and interfere with telemetry operations. During charging, the switch is closed, which allows the storage capacitor to couple to the tank circuitry through the rectifier during some portions of the tank circuitry's resonance.",BOSTON SCIENT NEUROMODULATION CORP,FELDMAN EMANUEL;;DRONOV VASILY;;PARRAMON JORDI;;OZAWA ROBERT;;RAHMAN MIZANUR,,https://lens.org/075-112-025-887-785,Granted Patent,no,0,0,16,16,0,A61N1/3787;;A61N1/3787;;A61N1/37223;;H01F38/14;;H02J50/12;;H04Q9/12,A61N1/378;;A61N1/36,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

As such, the tank circuitry is simplified and contains no switchable components. A switch is serially connected to the storage capacitor on the DC side of the circuit. During telemetry, the switch is opened, thus disconnecting the storage capacitor from the tank circuit, and alleviating concerns that this capacitor will couple to the tank circuit and interfere with telemetry operations.

A traditionally used tuning capacitor and switch are removed from the AC side of the circuit. A switch is connected in series to a storage capacitor on the DC side of the circuit and is substituted for the traditional switch by tuning the circuit for telemetry or charging. During telemetry, the switch is opened to disconnect the storage capacitor from the tank circuit, thus alleviating concerns that the capacitor will be coupled to the tank circuit to interfere with a telemetry operation. During charging, the switch is closed to allow the storage capacitor to be coupled to the tank circuit through the rectifier in a resonance portion of the tank circuit.SELECTED DRAWING: Figure 4A",BOSTON SCIENT NEUROMODULATION CORP,VASILY DRONOV;;JORDI PARRAMON;;ROBERT OZAWA;;MUHAMMAD MIZANUR RAHMAN;;FELDMAN EMANUEL,,https://lens.org/078-941-419-066-426,Patent Application,no,2,0,16,16,0,A61N1/3787;;A61N1/3787;;A61N1/37223;;H01F38/14;;H02J50/12;;H04Q9/12,A61N1/378,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

    A power monitor for a light emitter emitting from a single face creates a monitor beam by deflecting a portion of the application beam and further manipulating the monitor beam to allow more efficient use of the monitor beam. For example, the monitor beam may be collimated to allow an increase in spacing between the light emitter and a detector for sensing the monitor beam. Alternatively or additionally, the monitor beam may be focused to allow use of a smaller detector and of a smaller percentage of the application beam. The diffractive element deflecting the beam may be either transmissive or reflective. The additionally manipulation of the monitor beam may be provided by the same diffractive element which deflects the beam, which is particularly useful when the diffractive element is reflective, and/or by additional optical elements.

   A monitor for a light beam creates a monitor beam by deflecting a portion of the application beam and further manipulating the monitor beam and/or the application beam to allow more efficient use thereof. For example, the monitor beam may be collimated to allow an increase in spacing between the device outputting the light beam and a detector for sensing the monitor beam. Alternatively or additionally, the monitor beam may be focused to allow use of a smaller detector and of a smaller percentage of the application beam. The diffractive element deflecting the beam may be either transmissive or reflective. The additionally manipulation of the monitor beam and/or the application beam may be provided by the same diffractive element which deflects the beam, which is particularly useful when the diffractive element is reflective, and/or by additional optical elements.

    A passive optical network is provided that integrates signals carrying broadcast CATV services into a FTTH/C network that also provides high-speed Internet access and telephony. Essentially all residential telecommunications services are provided in a single network, based on a single fiber and a single simple transceiver in an optical network unit. Multiple services (e.g., analog video, digital video, cable-modem based Internet access) are multiplexed using separate rf subcarriers (subcarrier multiplexing or SCM) and the delivered signals are compatible with existing consumer appliances (e.g., TVs, VCRs, cable modems, etc.). The system and method combines a bi-directional network with dedicated upstream and downstream networks so that the most expensive and extensive portion of the network (the bi-directional outside plant infrastructure) need not be duplicated for each direction, while the use of two separate dedicated upstream and downstream networks further upstream facilitates flexible provisioning of bandwidth for each direction independently.

    A monitor for a light beam creates a monitor beam by deflecting a portion of the application beam and further manipulating the monitor beam and/or the application beam to allow more efficient use thereof. For example, the monitor beam may be collimated to allow an increase in spacing between the device outputting the light beam and a detector for sensing the monitor beam. Alternatively or additionally, the monitor beam may be focused to allow use of a smaller detector and of a smaller percentage of the application beam. The diffractive element deflecting the beam may be either transmissive or reflective. The additionally manipulation of the monitor beam and/or the application beam may be provided by the same diffractive element which deflects the beam, which is particularly useful when the diffractive element is reflective, and/or by additional optical elements.

The circuitry has a T-shape with respect to the battery terminal, with charging circuitry coupled between rectifier circuitry and the battery terminal on one side of the T, and load isolation circuitry coupled between the load and the battery terminal on the other side. The load isolation circuitry can comprise two switches wired in parallel. An undervoltage fault condition opens both switches to isolate the battery terminal from the load to prevent further dissipation of the battery. Other fault conditions will open only one the switches leaving the other closed to allow for reduced power to the load to continue implant operations albeit at safer low-power levels. The battery management circuitry can be fixed in a particular location on an integrated circuit which also includes for example the stimulation circuitry for the electrodes.

This data is then used to prepare a pipe to be inserted into the gas main by drilling holes and applying fittings at the appropriate locations. The prepared pipe is then inserted into the gas main and the service lines are connected to it without the need to excavate the street over each service connection. The inserted pipe is then fluidly connected to the cut ends of the gas main and gas flow is routed through the newly inserted pipe and the attached service lines, while gas continues to flow through the original portions of the gas main that still remain in service.
