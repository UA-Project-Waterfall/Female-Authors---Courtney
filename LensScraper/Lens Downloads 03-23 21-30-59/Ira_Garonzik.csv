According to one embodiment, an interbody fusion system may include an interbody fusion device implantable in an interbody space of a spinal joint. The interbody fusion device may include a first component and a second component. The first component and the second component, together, may define a mating interface at which the first component and the second component are securable together with the first component and the second component both positioned entirely within the interbody space. The first component and the second component, together, may have at least a first cavity that is exposed on a superior side and on an inferior side of the interbody fusion device. The system may further include a first inserter securable to a first proximal end of the first component and a second inserter securable to a second proximal end of the second component.",G6 SOLUTIONS LLC,GARONZIK IRA;;CONWAY JAMES;;SKINLO DAVID,G6 SOLUTIONS LLC (2018-02-06),https://lens.org/114-776-386-089-222,Patent Application,yes,0,10,1,1,0,A61F2/4455;;A61F2/4611;;A61F2002/30383;;A61F2002/30507;;A61F2002/30604;;A61F2002/448;;A61F2002/30904;;A61F2002/30593;;A61F2/447;;A61F2002/448;;A61F2002/30904;;A61F2002/30494;;A61F2002/30403;;A61F2/4455;;A61F2002/30383;;A61F2/4611;;A61F2002/30507;;A61F2002/30604;;A61F2002/30593,A61F2/44,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
