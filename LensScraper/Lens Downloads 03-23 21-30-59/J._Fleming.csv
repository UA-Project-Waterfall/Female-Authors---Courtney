The apparatus of the instant invention comprises intercept means which serves to intercept the call at the connector switch terminal and release the switch, re-dialer means for automatically generating dial pulses representative of a different subscriber line terminal on the connector switch, and means for effecting reconnection of the calling line to the brush, thus connecting the call to a different subscriber line through the connector switch. By means of the apparatus disclosed herein, an individual business or residence telephone line can become the directory number of a small hunting group in a step-by-step switching system, even though the telephone numbers consecutive to the individual line directory number are not available for use in the hunting group.

The key to the performance improvement obtained in the present invention is in the matching of sensor element [10] size to the electrical characteristics of the train of pulses [24,32] used to drive the sensor. The matching causes essentially all the energy provided to the sensor [11] to go into the desired sensor resonances, those in the direction of the sensor's thickness dimension [12]. The matching also minimizes the energy which goes into the undesired dilatational resonance modes [16,18] those in the sensor element's width dimension [14]. The invention discloses the matching of each sensor element [10] so that its maximum dilatational response [54] is essentially at the same frequency as every other element in the array, so that dilatational response is substantially reduced for the array as a whole. The invention also disclosed the ""fine tuning"" of the frequency of the drive pulses, so that the dilatational response is further reduced.

The matching causes essentially all the energy provided to the sensor [11] to go into the desired sensor resonances, those in the direction of the sensor's thickness dimension [12]. The matching also minimizes the energy which goes into the undesired dilatational resonance modes [16,18] those in the sensor element's width dimension [14]. The invention discloses the matching of each sensor element [10] so that its maximum dilatational response [54] is essentially at the same frequency as every other element in the array, so that dilatational response is substantially reduced for the array as a whole. The invention also discloses the ""fine tuning"" of the frequency of the drive pulses, so that the dilatational response is further reduced.

After poling, the resulting ultrasonic sensor [10] has the basic electrical properties of a conventional sensor in which the cuts are made completely through the shell [12]. However, the continuous concave side [14] of the ultrasonic sensor [10] need not be sealed. A conductive coating [32] on the concave side [14] serves as a common ground for all the array elements [38,40]. In another embodiment, the concave side is grooved and plated with a conductive layer [60]. Then a series of thin-kerfed circular cuts [62] are made from the convex side [16] so that they intersect the relatively thick grooves [56]. The thick conducting layer [60) serves as both common ground and mechanical support structure. In the previous art, the conductive coating would be required to have good impedance matching properties, in addition to adequate conductivity. In either embodiment of the present invention, when an impedance matching layer [41] is selected for application to the concave side [14], no compromises need be made in its properties. Therefore the impedance match can be optimized, and the material used need not be an electrical conductor. To complete the sensor airay, individual electrical conductors [42] are connected to the annuli [40] and central disc [38], at the convex side [16]. An acoustically attenuating layer [41] may be used on the convex side [16].

The magnetic field of the coil threads into the magnetostriction element and, due to the alternating magnetic field, the magnetostriction element changes its length at a rate equal to the frequency of the magnetic field. These length changes excite, among others, longitudinal waves in the core of the acoustic waveguide. The intraoperative probe has an array of acoustic waveguides bonded together. Each acoustic waveguide in the intraoperative probe has a transducer, such as a magnetostriction transducer of a piezoelectric transducer, that couples acoustic signals into the acoustic waveguides. The intraoperative probe can image the body without the extra hardware needed to rotate an acoustic waveguide by stepping an acoustic beam across the aperture of the intraoperative probe.

The key to the performance improvement obtained in the present invention is the method of forming the annular elements [38,40] of the array. In one approach, the elements [38,40] are not quite separated from one another at the concave side [14] of the sensor shell [12]. A series of cuts [34] are made into a shell [12] of piezoelectric material from its convex side [16]. These cuts [34] are made almost entirely through the shell [12] so that a small amount of material [20] remains between the cut and the concave side [14]. After poling, the resulting ultrasonic sensor [10] has the basic electrical properties of a conventional sensor in which the cuts are made completely through the shell [12]. However, the continuous concave side [14] of the ultrasonic sensor [10] need not be sealed. A conductive coating [32] on the concave side [14] serves as a common ground for all the array elements [38,40]. In another embodiment, the concave side is grooved and plated with a conductive layer [60]. Then a series of thin-kerfed circular cuts [62] are made from the convex side [16] so that they intersect the relatively thick grooves [56]. The thick conducting layer [60] serves as both common ground and mechanical support structure. In the previous art, the conductive coating would be required to have good impedance matching properties, in addition to adequate conductivity. In either embodiment of the present invention, when an impedance matching layer [41] is selected for application to the concave side [14], no compromises need be made in its properties. Therefore the impedance match can be optimized, and the material used need not be an electrical conductor. To complete the sensor array, individal electrical conductors [42] are connected to the annuli [40] and central disc [38], at the convex side [16]. An acousitically attenuating layer [41] may be used on the convex side [16].",HEWLETT PACKARD CO,DIAS J FLEMING,HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY A DELAWARE CORPORATION (1998-05-20);;AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES INC (2000-05-20);;HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY A CA.

Due to the size reduction provided, the Doppler probe is suitable for monitoring the blood flow in the coronary arteries. Using this invention wherein sound is transported to the catheter tip, risk is reduced and the catheter is significantly less expensive, and therefore can be treated as disposable.

The outer portion [20] of the sensor's aperture is sensitive to the lower frequency returns which are a consequence of the frequency downshifting. Therefore, the invention achieves a high degree of lateral resolution. The central portion [18,59] of the sensor is made thinner than the outer portion [20,57],so that the central portion is resonant at a higher frequency than the outer portion. Lateral resolution is improved by using the largest possible aperture to receive the downshifted frequencies. Techniques for shaping graded arrays, and for applying impedance matching layers [48] are disclosed for both spherical shells [10] and linear arrays [72].

The back face (150) of the transducer (110) is coupled to air. while impedance-matching layers (116) are on the front face of the transducer. The front face (152) is concave spherical to provide a geometric focus. The electrodes are driven at an ultrasound frequency. This arrangement (100) results in a longitudinal-mode ultrasound transmission through the front face (152) of the transducer (110). The eccentricity of the electrodes (121-128) precompensates for distortion imposed by a cylindrical window (112). The pitch (spacing) of the electrodes increases radially, reducing speckling in the ultrasound image. This transducer (100) provides for high-frequency intravascular examinations, and thus correspondingly high-resolution images, without using impractically thin piezoelectric substrates.

The back face of the transducer is coupled to air, while impedance-matching layers are on the front face of the transducer. The front face is concave spherical to provide a geometric focus. The electrodes are driven at an ultrasound frequency. This arrangement results in a longitudinal-mode ultrasound transmission through the front face of the transducer. The eccentricity of the electrodes precompensates for distortion imposed by a cylindrical window. The pitch (spacing) of the electrodes increases radially, reducing speckling in the ultrasound image. This transducer provides for high-frequency intravascular examinations, and thus correspondingly high-resolution images, without using impractically thin piezoelectric substrates. In addition, the geometric focus, the predistortion, and the speckle-reduction all reduce the artifacts in the resulting high-resolution ultrasound image.",HEWLETT PACKARD CO,DIAS J FLEMING,HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY (1992-12-15),https://lens.org/005-736-284-774-888,Granted Patent,yes,10,92,4,4,0,B06B1/0644;;G01S15/8925;;G01S7/52077;;G01S15/8956;;G01S15/8925;;B06B1/0644;;G01S15/8956;;G01S7/52077,B06B1/06;;A61B8/00;;G01S15/89,310/334;;128/662.03;;310/336;;310/359;;310/365;;310/366,9,3,017-987-382-942-576;;019-316-070-186-463;;016-887-775-668-518,10.1109/ultsym.1982.197875;;10.1109/ultsym.1985.198561;;10.1063/1.1754675,"Viktorov, I.

The key to the performance improvement obtained in the present invention is the method of forming the annular elements [38,40] of the array. In one approach, the elements [38,40] are not quite separated from one another at the concave side [14] of the sensor shell [12]. A series of cuts [34] are made into a shell [12] of piezoelectric material from its convex side [16]. These cuts [34] are made almost entirely through the shell [12] so that a small amount of material [20] remains between the cut and the concave side [14]. After poling, the resulting ultrasonic sensor [10] has the basic electrical properties of a conventional sensor in which the cuts are made completely through the shell [12]. However, the continuous concave side [14] of the ultrasonic sensor [10] need not be sealed. A conductive coating [32] on the concave side [14] serves as a common ground for all the array elements [38,40]. In another embodiment, the concave side is grooved and plated with a conductive layer [60]. Then a series of thin-kerfed circular cuts [62] are made from the convex side [16] so that they intersect the relatively thick grooves [56]. The thick conducting layer [60) serves as both common ground and mechanical support structure. In the previous art, the conductive coating would be required to have good impedance matching properties, in addition to adequate conductivity. In either embodiment of the present invention, when an impedance matching layer [41] is selected for application to the concave side [14], no compromises need be made in its properties. Therefore the impedance match can be optimized, and the material used need not be an electrical conductor. To complete the sensor airay, individual electrical conductors [42] are connected to the annuli [40] and central disc [38], at the convex side [16]. An acoustically attenuating layer [41] may be used on the convex side [16].

A Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) service is used in the preferred embodiments. The LDAP directory includes built-in functions for authenticating a user that requests access to an entry. Each resource that needs to be protected is mapped to an entry in the LDAP directory. These entries that correspond to protected resources external to the LDAP directory are called proxy entries. Proxy entries contain the authorization information for the corresponding protected resource in the form of an access control list for each entry that specifies the authorized users of the entry. When a user needs to access a protected resource, the user or an application uses the LDAP directory to determine whether the user is authenticated and authorized to access the proxy entry in the directory that corresponds to the resource. If the user is authenticated and authorized to access the proxy entry, the user may then access the corresponding external protected resource. The present invention thus allows the use of the internal LDAP authentication and authorization functions to determine which users are allowed to access protected resources that are external to the LDAP directory.",IBM,EGGEBRAATEN THOMAS J;;FLEMING PATRICK J,HCL TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED (2019-08-11),https://lens.org/019-952-519-065-31X,Patent Application,yes,0,11,4,4,0,G06F21/6218;;G06F21/6218;;H04L63/101;;H04L63/101;;H04L63/08;;H04L63/08,H04L9/00;;G06F21/00;;H04L29/06,713/182,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The sensor includes an excitation coil for generating a magnetic field passing through the shaft, and sensing coils for detecting changes in the magnetic field caused by changes in the permeability of the shaft. At least one pole is disposed adjacent the shaft, separated by an air gap, for coupling magnetic flux into or out of the shaft. The shaft has a radially extending surface adjacent to which the pole is disposed, and the air gap is represented by the axial spacing between the pole and the radially extending surface. The air gap is thus axial, and does not vary with radial movements of the shaft. In some of the embodiments described, plural poles are arranged symmetrically around the shaft such that other translational movements of the shaft produce offsetting changes in the sizes of various pole air gaps.

Sets of isothermal plasma operating conditions have been found that create a narrow deposition zone, assuring that the deposited material is clear glass rather than soot particles. The exhaust end of the tube is connected to a vacuum system which is in turn connected to a scrubber apparatus for removal and neutralization of reaction by-products.

Sets of isothermal plasma operating conditions have been found that create a narrow deposition zone, assuring that the deposited material is clear glass rather than soot particles. The exhaust end of the tube is connected to a vacuum system which is in turn connected to a scrubber apparatus for removal and neutralization of reaction by-products. The operating conditions are selected such that the hot plasma does not transfer a substantial amount of heat to the substrate tube, where the presence of such heat has been found to result in vaporizing the reactant material (creating soot) and developing hot spots.

Sets of isothermal plasma operating conditions have been found that create a narrow deposition zone, assuring that the deposited material is clear glass rather than soot particles. The exhaust end of the tube is connected to a vacuum system which is in turn connected to a scrubber apparatus for removal and neutralization of reaction by-products. The operating conditions are selected such that the hot plasma does not transfer a substantial amount of heat to the substrate tube, where the presence of such heat has been found to result in vaporizing the reactant material (creating soot) and developing hot spots.

In one embodiment, the matching layer is deposited onto the piezoelectric substrate and photolithographic techniques are utilized to pattern the matching layer to provide posts tailored to better match the piezoelectric substrate to a medium into which acoustic waves are to be transmitted. A nominal layer of metal between the posts and the piezoelectric substrate improves the attachment of the matching material to the substrate. The nominal layer may be chrome-gold and the matching material may be copper. Typically, the radiating surface is the substrate front surface from which acoustic waves are directed into a medium of interest, e.g., water or human tissue. However, the radiating surface may be the substitute rear surface, with the patterned matching layer providing acoustic matching to a backing layer for absorbing acoustic energy. In another embodiment, matching layers of different acoustic impedances are deposited and patterned on both the front and rear surfaces to provide matching for effective transmission into the medium of interest and into an acoustic absorptive backing medium.",HEWLETT PACKARD CO,DIAS J FLEMING;;SEYED-BOLORFOROSH MIR S,HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY (1994-04-04);;PHONE TEL COMMUNICATIONS INC (2000-04-28),https://lens.org/025-538-201-097-913,Granted Patent,yes,2,125,4,4,0,G10K11/02;;Y10T29/42;;Y10T29/42;;G10K11/02,G10K11/02;;H04R17/00,29/25.35;;310/334;;467/100,4,1,021-726-375-349-829,10.1109/ultsym.1991.234195,"Haller, M.

The numerous advantages of placing the piezoelectric transducer outside the body include: electric power does not enter the body; a reusable piezoelectric transducer; the ability to use several acoustic signals at once including a mixture of doppler and imaging acoustic signals; the ability to adjust the frequency of each acoustic signal independently of the other acoustic signals to obtain the most desirable focus and resolution for a particular imaging site; and lower cost of complying with sterility regulations since they require discarding only the inexpensive fiber acoustic waveguide and the inexpensive catheter-radome.",HEWLETT PACKARD CO,DIAS J FLEMING;;MELTON JR HEWLETT E,HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY (1992-07-22);;HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY A DELAWARE CORPORATION (1998-05-20);;AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES INC (2000-05-20),https://lens.org/158-953-309-541-650,Granted Patent,yes,7,75,2,9,0,A61B5/1459;;A61B8/06;;A61B8/0833;;A61B8/12;;A61B8/4461;;A61B8/4488;;A61B8/483;;A61B2017/22017;;G02B6/26;;G10K11/24;;A61B8/445;;A61B2034/2063;;A61B2090/3925;;A61B8/12;;A61B8/4461;;A61B8/06;;G10K11/24;;A61B8/483;;A61B8/0833;;A61B2017/22017;;A61B5/1459;;G02B6/26;;A61B8/4488;;A61B8/445;;A61B2034/2063;;A61B2090/3925,A61B5/00;;A61B8/06;;A61B8/08;;A61B8/12;;A61B17/22;;A61B19/00;;G02B6/26;;G10K11/24;;H03H9/145,128/662.06;;128/661.08;;128/663.01,7,7,069-632-173-379-645;;078-537-848-378-650;;067-274-330-819-633;;124-525-798-507-685;;157-166-673-718-257;;027-005-683-732-756;;053-105-472-186-848,10.1117/12.952180;;10.1109/ultsym.1991.234065;;10.1109/ultsym.1987.198999;;10.1109/ultsym.1985.198693;;10.1121/1.394531;;10.1109/ultsym.1985.198694;;10.1109/t-pgue.1960.29263,"N.

Sets of isothermal plasma operating conditions assure that the deposited material is clear glass rather than soot particles. The exhaust end of the tube is connected to a vacuum system which is in turn connected to a gas scrubber apparatus for removal and neutralization of reaction by-products. The operating conditions are selected such that the hot plasma does not transfer a substantial amount of heat to the substrate tube, where the presence of such heat results in vaporizing the reactant material (creating soot) and developing hot spots. <P>COPYRIGHT: (C)2009,JPO&INPIT",FURUKAWA ELECTRIC NORTH AM INC,FLEMING JR JAMES WILLIAM;;ZYDZIK GEORGE J,,https://lens.org/077-548-706-782-33X,Patent Application,no,2,2,11,13,0,C03B37/0183;;C03B37/01846;;C03B37/0183;;C03B37/01846,C03B37/018,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The waveguide extends from a main body (105) of the scanner into an oblong nose (109), and terminates in a deflector (149). To minimize thickness of the nose, the waveguide and deflector are rotated about an ultrasound transmission axis (119) of the waveguide, enabling the scanner to be used in a variety of situations where quarters are cramped. A coupling fluid (111) conveys ultrasound between the deflector (149) and a radome (113), which directly contacts the object (103) to be scanned. Using the waveguide, an ultrasound transducer and supporting electronics (118) may be distanced from the direct contact area (122) and separated from the fluid (111), thereby insulating the fluid from possible electronic leakage currents and heat.",HEWLETT PACKARD CO,DIAS J FLEMING;;MELTON HEWLETT E JR,,https://lens.org/026-021-748-195-730,Patent Application,yes,5,0,2,2,0,A61B8/12;;A61B8/12;;A61B8/445;;A61B8/445;;A61B8/4461;;A61B8/4461;;A61B2017/22017;;A61B2017/22017;;G10K11/24;;G10K11/24,A61B8/12;;A61B17/22;;G10K11/24,,0,0,,,,PENDING

    A cutting blade is disclosed fabricated of micromachined silicon. The cutting blade utilizes a monocrystalline silicon substrate having a 211 crystalline orientation to form one or more cutting edges that are defined by the intersection of 211 crystalline planes of silicon with 111 crystalline planes of silicon. This results in a cutting blade which has a shallow cutting-edge angle of 19.5. The micromachined cutting blade can be formed using an anisotropic wet etching process which substantially terminates etching upon reaching the 111 crystalline planes of silicon. This allows multiple blades to be batch fabricated on a common substrate and separated for packaging and use. The micromachined cutting blade, which can be mounted to a handle in tension and optionally coated for increased wear resistance and biocompatibility, has multiple applications including eye surgery (LASIK procedure).

   When the user is actively transmitting/receiving or has recently transmitted/received on the RF channel, the user is referred to as being in an active state. Typically, if the user is in the active state, and neither sends nor receives data for a timer period greater than a threshold, then the user is transitioned off of the RF channel (e.g. transitioned from active to dormant). Once a transition to the dormant state has occurred, the continued transmission or re-transmission of data over an RF channel can result in a delay in re-accessing the RF channel. In order to address this problem, the idle-timer threshold is dynamically adjusted based on a communication system statistic to increase system performance.

In order to address this problem, the idle-timer threshold is dynamically adjusted based on a communication system statistic to increase system performance.",MOTOROLA INC,HARRIS JOHN M;;FLEMING PHILIP J;;ARGYROPOULOS YIANNIS,MOTOROLA MOBILITY LLC (2012-06-22);;GOOGLE TECHNOLOGY HOLDINGS LLC (2014-10-28);;MOTOROLA INC (2002-01-16),https://lens.org/024-158-785-552-084,Granted Patent,yes,10,12,3,3,0,H04W76/38;;H04W76/38,H04W76/06,455/452.1;;455/453;;455/450,1,1,025-759-891-784-196,10.1109/49.464709,"Keshav, Srinivasan et al.

The LSF of the lens may also be used to define areas in which to adjust the light-emitting layer or anti-reflection coating thicknesses in directions extending across the LED regions to accentuate or attenuate light output intensity.

   A cutting blade is disclosed fabricated of micromachined silicon. The cutting blade utilizes a monocrystalline silicon substrate having a 211 crystalline orientation to form one or more cutting edges that are defined by the intersection of 211 crystalline planes of silicon with 111 crystalline planes of silicon. This results in a cutting blade which has a shallow cutting-edge angle of 19.5. The micromachined cutting blade can be formed using an anisotropic wet etching process which substantially terminates etching upon reaching the 111 crystalline planes of silicon. This allows multiple blades to be batch fabricated on a common substrate and separated for packaging and use. The micromachined cutting blade, which can be mounted to a handle in tension and optionally coated for increased wear resistance and biocompatibility, has multiple applications including eye surgery (LASIK procedure).

   The invention provides a method of screening for agents that promote or inhibit vasculogenesis or angiogenesis. The screening methods comprise culturing mesodermal stem cells, for example, allantoic cells; contacting the mesodermal stem cells with the agent to be screened; detecting endothelial cells or endothelial stem cells in the culture; and comparing the endothelial cells or endothelial cell precursors in the culture to be screened, with the endothelial cells or endothelial cell precursors in a control culture. An increase in endothelial cells or endothelial cell precursors in the culture to be screened indicates an agent that promotes vasculogenesis or angiogenesis. A decrease in endothelial cells or endothelial cell precursors in the culture to be screened indicates an agent that inhibits vasculogenesis or angiogenesis. 

   The present invention also provides a method of screening for an agent that stabilizes vasculature or promotes remodeling of vasculature. 

   The present invention further provides a method of screening for genes involved in promoting or inhibiting neovascularization (i.e., vasculogenesis and/or angiogenesis). 

   The invention further provides methods of using the identified nucleic acids or agents to promote or inhibit vasculogenesis or angiogenesis in a tumor, tissue, organ, or graft. Also provided are methods of preventing and treating neovascular-dependent diseases using agents or nucleic acids identified by the screening methods of the invention. 

   The invention further provides a method of determining whether stem cells of unknown endothelial cell potential can be promoted to differentiate into endothelial cell precursors.

    A method of making a polymer coating on a microstructured substrate. The method may be performed by vaporizing a liquid monomer or other pre-polymer composition and condensing the vaporized material onto a microstructured substrate, followed by curing. The resulting article may possess a coating that preserves the underlying microstructural feature profile. Such a profile-preserving polymer coating can be used to change or enhance the surface properties of the microstructured substrate while maintaining the function of the structure.

The screening methods comprise culturing mesodermal stem cells, for example, allantoic cells; contacting the mesodermal stem cells with the agent to be screened; detecting endothelial cells or endothelial stem cells in the culture; and comparing the endothelial cells or endothelial cell precursors in the culture to be screened, with the endothelial cells or endothelial cell precursors in a control culture. An increase in endothelial cells or endothelial cell precursors in the culture to be screened indicates an agent that promotes vasculogenesis or angiogenesis. A decrease in endothelial cells or endothelial cell precursors in the culture to be screened indicates an agent that inhibits vasculogenesis or angiogenesis. The present invention also provides a method of screening for an agent that stabilizes vasculature or promotes remodeling of vasculature. The present invention further provides a method of screening for genes involved in promoting or inhibiting neovascularization (i.e, vasculogenesis and/or angiogenesis).

An opening is made through an oxide layer over a central region of an n-type semiconductor substrate. The opening has inclined sidewalls over an annular region surrounding the central region of the substrate. An n-type dopant layer is ion implanted through the opening and the surrounding oxide layer. This controls the barrier height for the Schottky Barrier diode and controls the lifetime of minority carriers in the outside region of the substrate.

    A method of making a polymer coating on a microstructured substrate. The method may be performed by vaporizing a liquid monomer or other pre-polymer composition and condensing the vaporized material onto a microstructured substrate, followed by curing. The resulting article may possess a coating that preserves the underlying microstructural feature profile. Such a profile-preserving polymer coating can be used to change or enhance the surface properties of the microstructured substrate while maintaining the function of the structure.

Therefore, the likelihood of a chemical gas attack is higher when it is clear. In light of this and similar knowledge, the illustrative embodiment checks for evidence of an attack more frequently and with great acuity than when the ambient environmental (e.g., meteorological, etc.) characteristics (e.g., whether is it precipitating or not, whether it is sunny or not, etc) suggest that an attack is more likely.
