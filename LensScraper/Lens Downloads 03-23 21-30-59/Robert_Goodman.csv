   A method and system that reduces undesired vibration in a vehicle measures ambient vibration and generates a first command signal based upon said vibration measured in said step a. If a first component of the first command signal exceeds a maximum allowable, the first component of the first command signal must be constrained. A residual vibration resulting from the constraint of the first component is then calculated. A second command signal to compensate for said residual vibration is then calculated. Force generators are then activated based upon the constrained first component and the second command signal in order to reduce the vibration.

Record/playback systems; correcting for inherent distortions; electric analogue calculating. DECCA Ltd. Jan. 10, 1964 [Feb. 11, 1963], No. 5536/63. Headings G4G and G5R. To compensate for amplitude non-linear distortion in a magnetic tape record/playback system or in a complete magnetic record/reproduced gramophone disc/play-back disc system, a non- linear network 18 is added to the system, preferably ahead of the recording head 23, to provide a reciprocal amplitude non-linearity to that inherent in the record/playback system. The three pushpull diode stages in the network 18 come into operation at three preset amplitude levels to give a polygonal response curve approximating the record/playback curve. In Fig. 2, the network is driven in antiphase about a transformer centretap 36, while in Fig. 1, (not shown), the same network forms part of a negative feedback loop in a record head amplifier. For lateral-cut discs, the distortion is largely third-harmonic and the diode stages are symmetrical For vertical modulations on a disc, second-harmonic distortion may be compensated by unbalanced diode stages. Frequency correction may be applied to replacing the resistors of the network 18 by impedances with reactive components and the filter may also incorporate means (not detailed) to reduce the amplitude distortions due to the variable tracking radii of the record and playback styli.",DECCA LTD,GOODMAN ROBERT NEVILLE,,https://lens.org/069-274-995-465-270,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G03B27/73,G03B27/73,G5R RB11          11;;G5R RB25Y         11;;G5R RB252         RB33;;G5R RB252         11;;G5R RB263         RB33;;G5R RB263         11;;G5R RB264         RB33;;G5R RB264         11;;G5R RB33          RB33;;G5R RB36Y         RB33;;G5R RB36Y         11;;G5R RB361         RB33;;G5R RB361         11;;G5R RB37Y         RB33;;G5R RB37Y         11;;G5R RB38Y         RB33;;G5R RB38Y         11;;G5R RB383         RB33;;G5R RB383         11;;G5R RB427         RB33;;G5R RB427         11;;G5R RB56X         RB33;;G5R RB56X         11;;G5R RB56Y         11;;G5R RB60X         RB33;;G5R RB60X         11;;G5R RB693         RB33;;G5R RB693         11;;G5R RB731         RB33;;G5R RB731         11;;G5R RB788         RB33;;G5R RB788         11,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

When a particular prepaid parking pass, including a particular indicia, is presented, the indicia is identified. Then, verification of the validity of the prepaid parking pass is automatically provided by, for example, a database containing valid prepaid parking pass indicia data. If the prepaid parking pass is determined to be valid, the vehicle is allowed to enter the parking facility. If, on the other hand, the prepaid parking pass is determined to be invalid, the vehicle is not allowed to enter the parking facility.

    A method and apparatus are provided that reduce the training time associated with machine learning systems whose training time is proportional to the number of outputs being trained. Under embodiments of the invention, the number of outputs to be trained is reduced by dividing the objects to be modeled into classes. This produces at least two sets of model parameters. At least one set describes some aspect of the classes given some context, and at least one other set of parameters describes some aspect of the objects given a class and the context. Thus, instead of training a system with a large number of outputs, corresponding to all of the objects, the present invention trains at least two models, each of which has a much smaller number of outputs.

Simultaneous transmission of signals of both types over active telephone lines is possible without interference with telephone communications. Transmission succeeds without requiring special treatement of the video signals beyond RF conversion, despite signal attenuation inherent in transmission over the telephone line media. Two or more video sources may be tied into the system, and selected as desired. Remote control signals generated in one room may be utilized without requiring a clear line of sight between the remote control device and the receiver.

Simultaneous transmission of signals of both types over active telephone lines is possible without interference with telephone communications. Transmission succeeds without requiring special treatement of the video signals beyond RF conversion, despite signal attenuation inherent in transmission over the telephone line media. Two or more video sources may be tied into the system, and selected as desired. Remote control signals generated in one room may be utilized without requiring a clear line of sight between the remote control device and the receiver.

The 6-oxycaproyl and diamide units form at least 90 out of every 100 units in the macromolecular chains; the polyesteramides have a reduced viscosity of at least 0.3 dl. per g. measured in n-cresol at 25 DEG C. The diamine may be piperazine or 4,41-bipiperidyl and the dicarboxylic acid may be adipic acid or sebacic acid. In a preferred polyesteramide the polyamide is formed from piperazine and adipic acid and the 6-oxycaproyl units form 60-85 mole per cent of the polymer. The polyesteramide may be prepared by reacting an ester generating compound (e.g. e -caprolactone) with: (i) at least one diamine and at least one dicarboxylic acid as defined above, or (ii) an alkane dicarboxylate salt obtained from the diamine and dicarboxylic acid as defined above, or (iii) at least one polyamide derived from the said diamines and dicarboxylic acids. Reaction is carried out (e.g. at 180-300 DEG C. in an inert atmosphere) until the polymer has a reduced viscosity of 0.3 dl. per g. at 25 DEG C. in m-cresol. Reaction may be in two stages: (i) the reactants are heated in a nitrogen atmosphere to obtain a uniform melt, and (ii) the melt obtained is reacted in a rapid flow of nitrogen until a product of the desired intrinsic viscosity is obtained.

The invention also includes terephthalic acid, terephthalonitrile and high molecular weight polysulphonamides when prepared from these disulphonic acids obtained as above. The heating may take place at normal or super-atmospheric pressure, preferably in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide or nitrogen. The reaction will take place above 250 DEG C., but in the absence of a heavy metal catalyst a temperature above 375 DEG C. is generally needed; an upper limit of 600 DEG C. is mentioned. Catalysts containing mercury or chromium, e.g. the metal or its oxide, are preferred. The potassium or preferably the sodium salt may be used and the free acid may be obtained from the crude disulphonate by contacting with a cation-exchange resin. In examples: (1), (6), (7), (8), (9) disodium and (2) dipotassium benzene m-disulphonate is heated under various conditions to give the p-disulphonate; (3), (4), (5) disodium naphthalene-2:7-disulphonate is heated under various conditions to give the 2:6-disulphonate.

The latter are forced through smaller apertures in the shield, which is thereby distorted so as to assist in inhibiting deposition on the shield itself. If a conducting path is deposited on the shield between the conductors, it is stated that this is of a low resistance so that the current through it will burn the path away again.",BRITISH THOMSON HOUSTON CO LTD,WESTON ROBERT FREDERICK;;GOODMAN JOHN,,https://lens.org/080-782-410-650-542,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H05B41/06,H05B41/06,H1N NDQ           NDQ;;H1N N25Y          GE;;H1N N262          GE;;H1N N262          NDQ;;H1N N264          GE;;H1N N264          NDQ;;H1N N275          GE;;H1N N275          NDQ;;H1N N280          GE;;H1N N280          NDQ;;H1N N282          GE;;H1N N282          NDQ;;H1N N616          GE;;H1N N616          NDQ;;H1N N704          GE;;H1N N704          NDQ,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

R- may be (a) a hydrocarbon radical, e.g. a C3- 20 polymethylen radical, (b) a radical of formula -X(ZY)m-, where X and Y are hydrocarbon radicals, Z is -O- or hydrocarbon-substituted imino and m is an integer or (c) a derivative of (a) or (b) in which a carbon bonded hydrogen atom is replaced by a halogen atom or a hydrocarbon-oxy radical. The polymers may be derived from polyamide-forming monomers, e.g. lactams or amino-acids or N-acyl derivatives or esters thereof, and ester-forming monomers, e.g. e -caprolactone, e -hydroxy-caproic acid, its acetate or benzoate or its C1- 6 alkyl ester. Amide-forming monomers specified include e -caprolactam, 11-aminoundecanoic acid and e -amino-caproic acid. Where the amide-forming monomer is a lactam, the polymerization may be catalyzed by an anionic catalyst, e.g. an alkali metal such as Na or its oxide, hydroxide, carbonate, alkoxide or alkyl. In this case a lactone may be added in portions to the lactam during polymerization. If the amide-forming monomer is not a lactam the polymerization may be acid catalysed. Acids specified are sulphuric, phosphoric and p-toluene sulphonic. In either case the temperature may be 100-260 DEG C. and a reduced pressure or mobile inert gas atmosphere may be used. Hydroxy-acids other than hydroxycaproic acid, monohydric alcohols, mono-primary and secondary amines, monocarboxylic acids and cross-linking agents may be present. Before making the products into fibres, films, adhesives, coatings or moulded articles, thermo- and photostabilizers, lubricants, mould-release agents, pigments, dyes, fillers, plasticizers, and other natural or synthetic polymers may be added. In Example (3) a product of anionic polymerization is treated with HCl to neutralize the catalyst.

The invention also includes terephthalic acid, terephthalonitrile and high molecular weight polysulphonamides when prepared from these aromatic disulphonic acids obtained as above. The heating may take place at normal or superatmospheric pressures, preferably in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide or argon. The reaction will take place above 250 DEG C. but in the absence of a heavy metal catalyst a temperature of 425 DEG C. is generally needed, an upper limit of 600 DEG C. is mentioned. Catalysts containing chromium, mercury, vanadium and silver may be used. The potassium or preferably the sodium salt is used and the free acid may be obtained from the crude disulphonate by contacting with a cation-exchange resin. In examples: (1)-(8) and (14) sodium and (9) potassium benzene sulphonate is heated under various conditions to give the 1:4-disulphonate; (10) potassium and (11) sodium naphthalene-b -sulphonate is heated with cadmium dust to give the 2 : 6-disulphonate, (12) sodium naphthalene-a -sulphonate is heated to give the 2:6-disulphonate; (13) sodium diphenyl-4-sulphonate is heated to give a diphenyl-4:41-disulphonate.",ICI LTD,GOODMAN ISAAC;;EDINGTON ROBERT ALEXANDER,,https://lens.org/033-822-723-355-084,Granted Patent,no,0,1,2,3,0,C07C303/32,C07C303/32;;C07C309/29;;C07C309/32;;C07C309/35,C2C CBQ;;C2C CNR;;C2C CQD;;C2C CQE;;C2C C21X;;C2C C22Y;;C2C C22Y;;C2C C22Y;;C2C C22Y;;C2C C220;;C2C C220;;C2C C220;;C2C C220;;C2C C222;;C2C C227;;C2C C227;;C2C C227;;C2C C227;;C2C C26Y;;C2C C29Y;;C2C C29Y;;C2C C292;;C2C C292;;C2C C30Y;;C2C C30Y;;C2C C30Y;;C2C C30Y;;C2C C326;;C2C C34X;;C2C C366;;C2C C367;;C2C C37X;;C2C C39Y;;C2C C39Y;;C2C C394;;C2C C394;;C2C C42X;;C2C C42X;;C2C C42Y;;C2C C42Y;;C2C C485;;C2C C490;;C2C C560;;C2C C560;;C2C C60X;;C2C C60X;;C2C C605;;C2C C605;;C2C C63Y;;C2C C638;;C2C C666;;C2C C668;;C2C C69Y;;C2C C69Y;;C2C C69Y;;C2C C69Y;;C2C C699;;C2C C73Y,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

An electrostatic copier has rollers 30, 31, and 35 for feeding an original to be copied through a scanning station, a corona charging device 80 which uniformly charges both sides of a sensitized web fed from a roll 64 before exposure to an image of the original, and a developer station 83 having a reservoir (96), Fig. 2 (not shown) for containing liquid developer of one concentration of toner dispersed in liquid and a container 110 containing developer of a second concentration connected to the reservoir for replenishing, in controlled quantities, the liquid developer in the reservoir to maintain a predetermined level. The original is fed past an opening 42 for illumination by a high intensity lamp, e.g., a tungsten filament lamp having a quartz jacket. An image is reflected by a mirror 52 upwardly through lens 54 to a glass plate 84 forming an exposure station. Rollers 78, 82 feed the uniformly charged sensitized web through the exposure station to form a latent exposure station to form a latent electrostatic image. The web feed is controlled by microswitches 36 and 158, such that a sheet of a length substantially corresponding to the original is cut by a cutter 72 from the web. A pump (98), Fig.2 (not shown) in the reservoir (96) provides a flow of developer into channel 92, Fig. 1. Apertures 104, 106 are provided in plate 90. The copy sheet being developed is urged against plate 88 by the flow of developer through the apertures 104. The developer comprises pigment dispersed in a liquid. A float (112), Fig. 2 (not shown) controls an opening (118) which admits air to the container (110) to permit developer to flow in to the reservoir 96. Developer in container (110) is agitated by rocking a support (120) connected to a linkage (124) connected to a cam (126).

GENERAL ANILINE & FILM CORPORATION. Oct. 8, 1959 [Nov. 24, I958], No. 34157/59. Classes 97(1) and 98(2). Contact printing apparatus (Fig. 1) comprises a first rotatable support for a roll 5 of microfilm, a second rotatable support for the take up spool 5, means for taking up the slack in the film, a printing mechanism positioned between the two supports comprising means e.g. rotatable shades 42 for masking the undesired portion of the unwound film on the printing mechanism while leaving a section unmasked on a transparent support 43, a light source 53 which may be air cooled, timecontrolled shutter means 55 beneath the support, means for pressing a photo sensitive card against said film, and a viewer in casing 31 whereby the part of the film required for printing is chosen. When operating the apparatus the film is passed through a projecting device X which comprises a lamp 23, condenser 25 a lens barrel 27, projector lens 28, prism 29 and a focus lock 30. An image of the film is projected from the prism 29 via three mirrors 32, 33, 34 (when in the full line position) on to a viewing screen 35. The supports of mirrors 32, 34 are connected together by a rod 37 which in turn is connected to a lever 36. When this lever is rotated the mirrors 32, 34 are also rotated (see dotted position of 36, 32, 34) so that light may be reflected from mirror 32 to mirror 34 directly. The viewer may be moved transversely of the film by rotating lever 41 which is connected to a base 2 through a gear 38 and rack 39. When the desired part of the film is viewed the device 20 is clamped on to the film and is moved over scale 22 so that the desired part of the film is situated in a corresponding position relative to a scale 81 on the printing mechanism. The shades 42 are then adjusted. A photo sensitive card is then held by a spring 85 (Fig. 8) on platform 84. By moving lever 101 into the position shown on left in Fig. 8 the post 82 and platform 84 are coupled to a belt 93 (which is movable over rollers 89, 92 to slide post 82 along rails 93 and vary the position of the card relative to the operating position). A motor 76 (Fig. 3) is then turned on which rotates a shaft 75, which, through the medium of cam 74, follower 73 and levers (not shown) moves a platen 44 (Fig. 1) and guide member 70 forward over the card and then downwardly to press the card against the film. The shutter 55 is then opened and closed automatically by relay 57 energizing de-energizing solenoid 56 as determined by an exposure time control device 58 to photograph the film. The cam 74 then allows the platen 44 and guide members 70 to return to their inoperative position. The belt 93 and hence the post 82 is moved through a wheel 92 on a shaft 91. The shaft 91 is connected by levers 107, 105 to the cam 104 on the rotating shaft 75. The means for taking up the slack in the film comprises (Fig. 7) adjacent each of posts 3, 4 a lever 16 which is spring urged against the film and which has a rod 15 which turns a switch 19 of a motor 8 on or off according to its position i.e. according to the slackness of the film. The motor is connected by a belt 11 to the shaft 6 on which the film spool is fixed.",GEN ANILINE & FILM CORP,GOODMAN ROBERT CHARLES;;MASTROIANNI EMILIO GINO,,https://lens.org/187-892-202-929-87X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G03B27/08,G03B27/08,G2A AAL           AL;;G2A AALA          AL;;G2A A404          AL;;G2A A405          AL;;G2A A411          AL;;G2A A443          AL;;G2A A461          AL;;G2A A473          AL;;G2A A474          AL;;G2A A556          AL;;G2A A558          AL;;G2A A561          AL;;G2A A563          AL;;G2A A571          AL;;G2A A572          AL;;G2A A575          AL;;G2A A583          AL;;G2A A584          AL;;G2A A589          AL;;G2A A593          AL;;G2J J41           J41G2;;G2J J41G2         J41G2,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In a ""training mode"", an electronic source in a downhole sonde transmits a predetermined training sequence to a surface modem via a cable. The source preferably transmits the training sequence continuously until the surface modem has acclimated itself to the characteristics of the multiconductor cable by adaptively configuring the filter-equalizer, thereby enabling the surface modem to accurately interpret data received from the sonde despite attenuation, noise, or other distortion on the cable. The filter-equalizer adjusts itself in response to an error signal generated by comparing the filter-equalizer's output with a similar training sequence provided by a training generator. After the surface modem is trained, the system operates in an ""operational mode,"" in which the sonde transmits data corresponding to downhole measurements, and the filter-equalizer's error signal is generated by comparing the filter-equalizer's output to a sliced version of the filter-equalizer's output.

Selective signalling. GAF CORP. 7 Nov., 1967 [10 Nov., 1966], No. 50663/67. Heading G4H. [Also in Division G2] In a paper feed for a photo-copying machine, copy paper is supplied in at least two different widths, the appropriate width being selected automatically by sensing the width of the original as it is fed to the machine. The required length of copy paper is also sensed automatically, and cut off. In the form shown, rolls 5, 7 supply copy paper 10, 12 of two different widths (e.g. 11 inches and 19 inches). These paper webs pass between respective pairs of feed rollers 43, 45 and 43<SP>1</SP>, 45<SP>1</SP>, driven by respective motors 44, 44<SP>1</SP>, then past a cutter bar 58, and are delivered on to a transfer belt 74. The original 14 is fed into a guide slot 40, passes between roller pairs 26, 27, and is also delivered on to the belt 74. This carries the two superimposed sheets on into the copying machine proper. From Fig. 4, it can be seen that as sheet 14 enters into guide slot 40, its leading edge may engage fingers 32, 33, 34 which actuate corresponding switches 29, 30, 31. The sheet 14, actually in phantom, is of the narrower width (11 inches), so that it actuates only the first two switches, 29, 30, in turn. This energizes a clutch 47 which connects the drive from motor 44 to roller 43, so causing copy paper 10 to be fed forward. When the trailing edge of the original disengages from switch 29, clutch 47 is de-energized, so that the motor drive to roller 43 is disconnected, and at the same time a braking arrangement 46 at the other end of roller 43 is brought into action to stop the roller and hence the motion of paper web 10. Also at the same time a solenoid 64 is energized, which rotates the cutter bar 58 to sever the sheet 10. The speeds of the various sheet-transporting devices is adjusted so that the sheets form a looped portion 81 at the approach to belt 74. This enables the part of sheet 10 which is being cut to be momentarily arrested although the forward end is still moving. It is also arranged that, after cutting, roller 43 is counter-rotated, so that the severed end of web 10 is withdrawn from the cutting station. Thus the station is left clear if a different web is to be fed forward next time. If sheet 14 has the wider of the two predetermined widths, the switches 29, 31, 30 are all actuated in succession. This causes clutch 47<SP>1</SP> to be energized instead of clutch 47. Thus the drive from motor 44<SP>1</SP> is connected to roller 43<SP>1</SP>, and hence the wider copy paper web 12 is fed forward through the cutter station, &c., the sequence of operations otherwise being as before. The operations are all controlled automatically by the electrical circuit of Fig. 8 (not shown).",GAF CORP,GOODMAN ROBERT CHARLES;;SAMES DELBERT WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/000-731-726-232-994,Granted Patent,no,0,0,9,10,0,B41F33/02;;B65H33/00;;G03B27/14;;Y10T83/2094;;Y10T83/446;;Y10T83/4448;;Y10T83/2094;;Y10T83/446;;Y10T83/4448;;G03B27/14;;B65H33/00;;B41F33/02,B26D7/32;;B41F33/02;;B65H20/00;;B65H33/00;;G03B27/14,G2A A404          2A;;G2A A405          2A;;G2A A436          2A;;G2A A473          2A;;G2A A474          2A;;G2A A624          2A;;G2A A629          2A;;G2A A632          2A;;G2A A635          2A;;G2A A679          2A;;G2A A687          2A;;G2A A689          2A;;G2A A708          2A;;G2A A712          2A;;G2A A754          2A;;G2A A755          2A,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In particular, the method is useful when the sequences of the desired and undesired DNA templates are similar. A set of universal primers binds to both the desired and undesired DNA templates during a PCR, resulting in the amplification of their DNA sequences. The method targets the undesired DNA template with three sets of oligonucleotide primers, one set of which is terminally modified to both prevent primer extension and increase the primer-template binding affinity.

GENERAL ANILINE & FILM CORPORATION. Sept. 30, 1960 [Oct. 1, 1959], No. 33663/60. Class 98 (2). [Also in Groups XVI and XXIV] In photo copying apparatus a continuous length of light-sensitive material is passed through an exposing area and then through a printing area, by means of two endless belt conveyer systems, one system serving each area; means are provided for conveying power from a motor to a drive roller for the first of said systems, and from that drive roller to the drive roller of the second of said systems, this latter means including a unidirectional coupling element ; ancillary means are also provided for conveying power from said first to said second drive roller by-passing said unidirectional coupling, the effectiveness of the ancillary means being adjustable. In the form shown, the sheet of sensitive material 27 is fed in from a supply roll 28 and passes, together with an original, between endless belts 10, 17 round a cylinder 8 and light source 9 where the exposure takes place. The sheets then pass between belts 10 and 84 where they are separated by suction devices 82, 89. The original passes out on to tray 87, while the sensitive sheet passes to the developer section, where it is held by belt 33 against a vapour developing tank 30, finally being led either out of the apparatus through an exit opening, or on to a receiving tray 45. The endless belts 10, 33 form the two main conveyer systems, serving the "" exposure "" and "" development "" stations, respectively. The rollers 11 and 35 form the drive rollers of these two sections, respectively. The power source is a motor, connected directly by a chain drive 48 to a sprocket 35<SP>1</SP> fixed to roller 35. The sprocket 35<SP>1</SP> is of double construction, having a second sprocket section 59, which drives a chain 53 passing over further sprockets 11<SP>1</SP> and 54. Sprocket 11<SP>1</SP> drives the roller 11, which is the drive roller for the belt 10. Thus the motor directly drives roller 35 and thence roller 11, themselves the drive rollers for the two main conveyer belts. The sprocket 11<SP>1</SP> is not directly keyed to the main shaft 62 of roller 11, but drives it via a unidirectional ball-clutch 63, so that roller 11 can turn at a higher speed than that provided by chain 53. The sprocket 54, which is also driven by chain 53, rides freely on a stud 68 fixed to the supporting wall 69. Another sprocket 74 also rides freely on stud 68, and is connected by a chain 56 to a sprocket 80 keyed to the shaft 62 of roller 11. This is the ancillary drive means referred to above. A friction clutch 67 is mounted on stud 68, and can be engaged against sprocket 54 to an adjustable degree by means of a spring 76 whose compression is controlled by a knob 78. The other side of sprocket 54 has a face-plate 72 which can engage frictionally against another face-plate 73 attached to sprocket 74. Thus when friction clutch 67 is completely disengaged, sprockets 54 and 74 turn freely and loosely on stud 68. As knob 78 is turned, to engage the clutch, sprockets 54 and 74 engage frictionally, and the drive from sprocket 35<SP>1</SP> via chain 53 is transmitted not only to sprocket 11<SP>1</SP> (and hence to roller 11) but also, via sprockets 74 and 80, to roller 11 directly, by-passing sprocket 11<SP>1</SP> and the ball-clutch 63. The drive operation is as follows. If a length of sensitized material 57 is travelling through the machine, and a greater pull is exerted on the material by the "" development "" belt system (driven by roller 35), this would tend to tear the material. But since the ball-clutch 63 allows the roller at the feed-in position (roller 11) to rotate at a higher speed than the drive, this pull or tension in the material is eliminated. However, this alone would not be adequate unless the material itself had a greater tensile strength than sensitized paper usually possesses. Assistance is provided, therefore, by the ancillary drive, which acts as a torque-assist mechanism. This transmits part of the drive directly to roller 11, bypassing clutch 63, thus assisting the paper feed. The degree of assistance can be set by adjusting knob 78 controlling the friction clutch 67, and this adjustment, once made, should remain reasonably constant for any particular type of paper.",GEN ANILINE & FILM CORP,KOTTMAN JOSEPH J;;GOODMAN ROBERT CHARLES,,https://lens.org/057-920-223-837-503,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,G03B27/30;;G03B27/30,G03B27/30,G2A AADX          AADX;;G2A AEJ           EJ;;G2A A404          EJ;;G2A A405          EJ;;G2A A425          EJ;;G2A A433          EJ;;G2A A473          EJ;;G2A A555          EJ;;G2A A558          EJ;;G2A A563          EJ;;G2A A571          EJ;;G2A A572          EJ;;G2A A574          EJ;;G2A A576          EJ;;G2A A753          EJ;;G2A A758          EJ,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The winner of the conflict resolution, and possibly the losers, report the conflict to the home node, which pairs conflict reports and issues forwarding instructions to assure that all requesting nodes eventually receive the requested data. If a requested cache line is either uncached or present only in the Shared state, the home node provides a copy of the cache node and resolves conflicts.

The winner of the conflict resolution, and possibly the losers, report the conflict to the home node, which pairs conflict reports and issues forwarding instructions to assure that all requesting nodes eventually receive the requested data. If a requested cache line is either uncached or present only in the Shared state, the home node provides a copy of the cache node and resolves conflicts.

The winner of the conflict resolution, and possibly the losers, report the conflict to the home node, which pairs conflict reports and issues forwarding instructions to assure that all requesting nodes eventually receive the requested data. If a requested cache line is either uncached or present only in the Shared state, the home node provides a copy of the cache node and resolves conflicts.

Also mounted on the substrate are a plurality of power supply chips. Each of the power supply chips is connected through conductors and vias in the substrate to a separate functional block on the IC semiconductor piece. Each of the power supply chips forms part of a circuit, such as a DC-DC converter, which is capable of reducing a voltage supplied thereto to a lower voltage suitable for the particular functional block to which the particular power supply chip is connected.

   An integrated circuit system includes a substrate of an electrical insulating material having a surface. Mounted on the surface of the substrate is an IC, a semiconductor piece having therein a circuit, such as a microprocessor, having a plurality of functional blocks. Also mounted on the substrate are a plurality of power supply chips. Each of the power supply chips is connected through conductors and vias in the substrate to a separate functional block on the IC semiconductor piece. Each of the power supply chips forms part of a circuit, such as a DC-DC converter, which is capable of reducing a voltage supplied thereto to a lower voltage suitable for the particular functional block to which the particular power supply chip is connected. Thus, a single relatively large voltage fed to the power supply chips through conductors on the substrate is reduced by each power supply chip to a lower voltage suitable for the particular functional block of the IC semiconductor piece.

In addition, outgoing messages can be scored based at least in part on their content. The scores can be added per message per sender and if the total score(s) per message or per sender exceeds some threshold, then further action can be taken to verify whether the potential spammer is a spammer. Such actions include human-inspecting a sample of the messages, sending challenges to the account, sending a legal notice to warn potential spammers and/or shutting down the account.",MICROSOFT CORP,GOODMAN JOSHUA T;;ROUNTHWAITE ROBERT L;;GILLUM ELIOT C,MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (2003-11-13),https://lens.org/142-856-992-411-280,Granted Patent,yes,110,78,9,9,0,G06F21/316;;G06F21/552;;G06F2221/2103;;H04L63/0227;;H04L63/1416;;H04L51/212;;G06Q50/40;;G06F21/552;;G06F21/316;;G06F2221/2103;;H04L63/0227;;H04L63/1416;;H04L51/212,G06F11/30;;G06F13/00;;H04L12/58,709/206,98,18,002-381-880-009-593;;013-672-550-664-930;;121-001-950-491-969;;028-908-493-971-928;;138-340-571-248-508;;111-836-584-185-963;;085-372-607-665-799;;059-354-363-058-623;;134-948-950-072-098;;078-019-911-797-701;;036-514-594-833-389;;062-580-681-886-313;;051-264-703-806-553;;063-348-329-617-640;;074-362-647-607-886;;006-611-131-631-71X;;038-103-171-195-828;;085-372-607-665-799,10.1511/2003.3.200;;10.1117/12.484894;;10.1145/505282.505283;;10.1145/345508.345569;;10.1145/572020.572034;;10.1145/280324.280336;;10.1145/287831.287833;;10.1145/945131.945157;;10.1145/980972.980990;;10.1145/508909.508911;;10.1007/3-540-48071-4_10;;10.1145/215206.215365;;10.1145/183422.183424;;10.1145/133160.133172;;10.1093/comjnl/41.8.537;;10.1109/hicss.1998.648295;;10.1016/0140-3664(96)01049-3;;10.1145/287831.287833,"European Search Report dated Apr. 6, 2006 and mailed Apr. 6, 2006 for EP 04102242, 3 pages.;;Graham.

VAR imaging exploits the sparse, dominant-scatterer nature of man-made targets. The array manifold is constructed with a large number of basis functions that are parameterized by range or angle (or both) to target. The number of basis functions extends the capability to resolve scatterers beyond the Rayleigh resolution. However, this also makes the manifold underdetermined. A sparse reconstruction technique that places a sparsity constraint on the number of scatterers is used to solve the manifold to uniquely identify the ranges or angles to the scatterers on the target. These updates are passed to the weapon's guidance system, which in turn generates command signals to actuate aerodynamic surfaces such as fins or canards to steer the weapon to the target.",SAMUEL ALPHONSO A;;PAWLOSKI ROBERT M;;GOODMAN NATHAN A;;RAYTHEON CO;;UNIV ARIZONA STATE,SAMUEL ALPHONSO A;;PAWLOSKI ROBERT M;;GOODMAN NATHAN A,THE ARIZONA BOARD OF REGENTS ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA (2011-01-28);;RAYTHEON COMPANY (2011-02-01),https://lens.org/145-632-689-417-109,Granted Patent,yes,11,11,2,2,0,G01S13/726;;G01S13/90;;F41G7/2246;;F41G7/2286;;G01S13/90;;F41G7/2286;;G01S13/726;;F41G7/2246,G01S13/90;;F41G7/28,342/62;;X342 25 A,18,9,097-968-299-686-899;;095-342-113-353-096;;042-677-765-442-686;;024-221-154-288-888;;087-537-451-037-619;;077-663-743-523-920;;085-639-049-217-093;;000-273-304-888-728;;024-934-444-436-551,10.2528/pier10080805;;10.1109/taes.2005.1541439;;10.1137/080714488;;10.1137/s1064827596304010;;10.1109/msp.2007.914731;;10.1109/radar.2007.374203;;10.1109/igarss.2005.1525801;;10.1109/tsp.2009.2014277;;10.1049/ip-rsn:19981731,"Wei et al.

When the pixels are illuminated, each generates a two-dimensional optical catastrophe image diffraction pattern whereby the total image diffraction pattern of the grating is optically variable but structurally stable. The invention further provides a diffraction grating of reflective or transmissive lines, comprising a multiplicity of diffraction grating regions which are at least partly separated by multiplicity of grating free regions.

Ink is applied to the form roller by an applicator roller having a surface with an array of interconnected wells and a variable speed drive. The form roller and plate cylinder are rotated at the same rpm while the speed of the applicator roller is varied to vary the amount of ink applied to the plate. A variable speed subtractive roller system removes excess ink from the form roller and returns the ink to a common reservoir. For wash-up, the press drive and form roller are disengaged and the inking system is rotated by an inker roller drive while wash-up fluid is applied to the inking system.

If a line is in the Exclusive, Modified or Forward state, conflicts are resolved at the node holding the unique copy. The winner of the conflict resolution, and possibly the losers, report the conflict to the home node, which pairs conflict reports and issues forwarding instructions to assure that all requesting nodes eventually receive the requested data. If a requested cache line is either uncached or present only in the Shared state, the home node provides a copy of the cache node and resolves conflicts.

VAR imaging exploits the sparse, dominant-scatterer nature of man-made targets. The array manifold is constructed with a large number of basis functions that are parameterized by range or angle (or both) to target. The number of basis functions extends the capability to resolve scatterers beyond the Rayleigh resolution. However, this also makes the manifold underdetermined. A sparse reconstruction technique that places a sparsity constraint on the number of scatterers is used to solve the manifold to uniquely identify the ranges or angles to the scatterers on the target.

    A printing system is disclosed including an inking system with a single form roller for applying ink to a printing cylinder. Ink is applied to the form roller by an applicator roller having a surface with an array of interconnected wells and a variable speed drive. The form roller and plate cylinder are rotated at the same rpm while the speed of the applicator roller is varied to vary the amount of ink applied to the plate. A variable speed subtractive roller system removes excess ink from the form roller and returns the ink to a common reservoir. For wash-up, the press drive and form roller are disengaged and the inking system is rotated by an inker roller drive while wash-up fluid is applied to the inking system.

When the pixels are illuminated, each generates a two-dimensional optical catastrophe image diffraction pattern whereby the total image diffraction pattern of the grating is optically variable but structurally stable. The invention further provides a diffraction grating of reflective or transmissive lines, comprising a multiplicity of diffraction grating regions which are at least partly separated by multiplicity of grating free regions. Each grating free region has a dimension which is at least large enough to be resolved by the human eye, the total grating free areas not exceeding about 20 to 50% of the total area of the grating.

The system includes a randomization component that randomizes a message score before the message is classified as spam or non-spam so as to obscure the functionality of the spam filter. Randomizing the message score can be accomplished in part by adding a random number or pseudo-random number to the message score before it is classified as spam or non-spam. The number added thereto can vary depending on at least one of several types of input such as time, user, message content, hash of message content, and hash of particularly important features of the message, for example. Alternatively, multiple spam filters can be deployed rather than a single best spam filter.

    A method for re-establishing communication between a base station (  102  ) that transmits on a forward channel, and a subscriber unit (  108  ) that has temporarily lost the forward channel, uses the concept of a re-registration interval. The base station (  102  ) transmits, to subscriber units (  106, 108  ) in its area, a signal indicating the duration of a re-registration interval. A subscriber unit that has temporarily lost the forward channel determines whether the duration of such loss exceeds the re-registration interval. If the interval is exceeded, the subscriber unit sends a re-registration signal to the base station on a reverse channel. A selective call transceiver (  400  ) is programmed to operate as a subscriber unit that uses the re-registration interval.

If a line is in the Exclusive, Modified or Forward state, conflicts are resolved at the node holding the unique copy. The winner of the conflict resolution, and possibly the losers, report the conflict to the home node, which pairs conflict reports and issues forwarding instructions to assure that all requesting nodes eventually receive the requested data. If a requested cache line is either uncached or present only in the Shared state, the home node provides a copy of the cache node and resolves conflicts. In one embodiment, a blackout period after all responses until an acknowledgement message has been received allows all conflicting nodes to be aware of conflicts in which they are involved.",INTEL CORP,BEERS ROBERT H;;HUM HERBERT H;;GOODMAN JAMES R,,https://lens.org/053-153-855-179-908,Patent of Addition,no,0,0,15,15,0,G06F12/0831;;G06F12/0831;;G06F12/0813;;G06F12/0813,G06F12/08,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The circular RNAs can comprise group I intron fragments, spacers, an IRES, duplex forming regions, and/or an expression sequence, thereby having the features of improved expression, functional stability, low immunogenicity, ease of manufacturing, and/or extended half-life compared to linear RNA. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising such circular RNAs and transfer vehicles are particularly suitable for efficient protein expression in immune cells in vivo. Also disclosed are precursor RNAs and materials useful in producing the precursor or circular RNAs, which have improved circularization efficiency and/or are compatible with effective circular RNA

The definition of what dimensions of classification there are and what distinctions are drawn during the process of classification is defined by the business application administrator. Once a classification definition is in place, it may be used and reused, along with other classifications, to be associated with actions that select the appropriate content. In order to describe what actions to take under a variety of business conditions, an administrator chooses a classifier to be used to assess the business situation, selects the relevant classifications and associates one or more actions with each classification to be invoked by a selector.",IBM,EHNEBUSKE DAVID LARS;;GOODMAN ROBERT SIMON;;MCKEE BARBARA JANE ALSPACH,LEVEL 3 COMMUNICATIONS LLC (2007-12-14);;INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (2000-08-10),https://lens.org/004-067-780-410-600,Granted Patent,yes,3,23,1,1,0,G06Q30/0603;;G06Q30/0603;;G06Q30/0271;;G06Q30/0271;;G06Q30/0277;;G06Q30/0277,G07G1/00,705/14,1,0,,,"Taylor, David A, ""Object-Oriented Information Systems,"" 1992, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., pp. 1-3, 27-31, 41-44, 83-85, 224-226.",EXPIRED

   A conflict resolution technique provides consistency such that all conflicts can be detected by at least one of the conflicting requestors if each node monitors all requests after that node has made its own request. If a line is in the Exclusive, Modified or Forward state, conflicts are resolved at the node holding the unique copy. The winner of the conflict resolution, and possibly the losers, report the conflict to the home node, which pairs conflict reports and issues forwarding instructions to assure that all requesting nodes eventually receive the requested data. If a requested cache line is either uncached or present only in the Shared state, the home node provides a copy of the cache node and resolves conflicts. In one embodiment, a blackout period after all responses until an acknowledgement message has been received allows all conflicting nodes to be aware of conflicts in which they are involved.

If a line is in the Exclusive, Modified or Forward state, conflicts are resolved at the node holding the unique copy. The winner of the conflict resolution, and possibly the losers, report the conflict to the home node, which pairs conflict reports and issues forwarding instructions to assure that all requesting nodes eventually receive the requested data. If a requested cache line is either uncached or present only in the Shared state, the home node provides a copy of the cache node and resolves conflicts.

   Disclosed is a method to detect unlabeled nucleic acids (DNA and/or RNA) in a taxa, species, and organelle-specific fashion using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging. Taxa-specific, species-specific, or organelle-specific nucleic acids are affixed to an SPR-suitable substrate. A nucleic acid sample to be analyzed is then contacted with the SPR-substrate and the substrate analyzed to determine the presence or absence of specific hybridization between the nucleic acids bound to the substrate and the nucleic acids contained in the sample. The method does not require that either the bound nucleic acids nor the sample nucleic acids be labeled. The method can be used to identify the source of nucleic acids, their sequence, as well as to identify organisms and place them within a given taxonomic hierarchy.

The bleed valve is designed so that moveable parts of the valve, including contact seals and a sliding shaft, are protected by the valve structure from debris and contaminants carried in the engine's air stream.",D'ANGELO GARY;;BANACH TOM;;FRANCONI ROBERT;;GIBB JAMES;;GOODMAN BOB,D ANGELO GARY;;BANACH TOM;;FRANCONI ROBERT;;GIBB JAMES;;GOODMAN BOB,HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC (2003-06-25),https://lens.org/173-860-425-404-54X,Patent Application,yes,15,18,4,4,0,F16K1/126;;F16K1/126;;F01D17/105;;F01D17/105;;F02C9/18;;F02C9/18;;F04D27/0215;;F04D27/0215;;F04D27/023;;F04D27/023;;F05D2260/607;;F05D2260/607;;Y02T50/60;;Y02T50/60,F01D17/10;;F02C9/18;;F16K1/12,415/144,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

At that remote site, the pump pulse is amplified and used to locally create the second entangled photon pair that is required for quantum teleportation. This embodiment enables the placement of quantum repeater stations at remote locations without complicated dedicated channels to distribute the pump or electronics.

In one embodiment of this architecture, time and wavelength division multiplexing are used to enable a laser pump pulse, already used to create an initial entangled photon pair, to be distributed to a remote relay site, on the same optical fiber as a photon from that initial pair. At that remote site, the pump pulse is amplified and used to locally create the second entangled photon pair that is required for quantum teleportation. This embodiment enables the placement of quantum repeater stations at remote locations without complicated dedicated channels to distribute the pump or electronics. In addition, as lasers are generally among the most expensive components, a significant cost savings is gained, in this embodiment, by using only one pump laser instead of two (or more) as in previous quantum teleportation efforts.",PETERS NICHOLAS A;;CHAPURAN THOMAS E;;RUNSER ROBERT;;GOODMAN MATTHEW S;;TELCORDIA TECH INC,PETERS NICHOLAS A;;CHAPURAN THOMAS E;;RUNSER ROBERT;;GOODMAN MATTHEW S,TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES INC (2009-08-12);;PERSPECTA LABS INC (2013-05-14),https://lens.org/023-928-865-953-314,Granted Patent,yes,18,18,3,3,0,H04B10/70;;H04B10/70;;H04L9/0855;;H04L9/0855,H04B10/02,398/173;;398/140;;398/175,5,4,004-417-489-504-676;;000-493-467-591-173;;048-546-363-601-101;;110-008-298-100-279,10.1103/physrevlett.96.110501;;16605806;;10.1103/physrevlett.96.240502;;16907224;;10.1103/physreva.79.040302;;10.1088/0031-8949/11/3/033008,"International Search Report dated Sep. 29, 2009.;;Tao Yang, et al., ""Experimental Synchronization of Independent Entangled Photon Sources,"" Phys.

   The subject invention provides for an intelligent quarantining system and method that facilitates a more robust classification system in connection with spam prevention. The invention involves holding back some messages that appear to be questionable, suspicious, or untrustworthy from classification (as spam or good). In particular, the filter lacks information about these messages and thus classification is temporarily delayed. This provides more time for a filter update to arrive with a more accurate classification. The suspicious messages can be quarantined for a determined time period to allow more data to be collected regarding these messages. A number of factors can be employed to determine whether messages are more likely to be flagged for further analysis. User feedback by way of a feedback loop system can also be utilized to facilitate classification of the messages. After some time period, classification of the messages can be resumed.

    Novel constructs are provided for expression of physiologically active mammalian proteins in plant cells, either in culture or under cultivation. The constructs provide a promoter functional in a plant host, a structural gene coding for mammalian protein and a terminator functional in a plant host. The construct is introduced into a plant cell to become integrated into the plant genome for expression in the plant cells or plants. The plant cells may be harvested and the mammalian protein isolated in physiologically active form.

In one embodiment of this architecture, time and wavelength division multiplexing are used to enable a laser pump pulse, already used to create an initial entangled photon pair, to be distributed to a remote relay site, on the same optical fiber as a photon from that initial pair. At that remote site, the pump pulse is amplified and used to locally create the second entangled photon pair that is required for quantum teleportation. This embodiment enables the placement of quantum repeater stations at remote locations without complicated dedicated channels to distribute the pump or electronics.

According to the preferred embodiment, a signal, e.g., a speech waveform, is first converted into a sequence of digital data samples, and a reference position along a first sub-part of the sequence is then selected. A ""weighted"" histogram corresponding to the reference position is then generated according to a correlation function. Thereafter, a new reference position is selected, for example, at a sub-part of the sequence located a pitch period of the signal from the original reference position, and an additional histogram is generated for this sub-part. The plurality of histograms comprise the transformation of the signal, which retains a substantial part of the informational content of the original signal. Therefore, the transformation is then used as the signal itself in signal processing applications such as speech compression and synthesis.

In one aspect, the chemically regulatable DNA sequences of the invention are derived from the 5' region of genes encoding pathogenisis-related (PR) proteins. The present invention also provides anti-pathogenic sequences derived from novel cDNAs coding for PR proteins which can be genetically engineered and transformed into plants to confer enhanced resistance to disease. Also provided is a method for the exogenous regulation of gene expression in plants, which comprises obtaining a plant incapable of regulating at least one gene or gene family, or at least one heterologous gene, due to the deactivation of at least one endogenous signal transduction cascade which regulates the gene in the plant, and applying a chemical regulator to the plant at a time when expression of the gene is desired. A novel signal peptide sequence and corresponding DNA coding sequence is also provided Further provided are assays for the identification and isolation of additional chemically regulatable DNA

If a line is in the Exclusive, Modified or Forward state, conflicts are resolved at the node holding the unique copy. The winner of the conflict resolution, and possibly the losers, report the conflict to the home node, which pairs conflict reports and issues forwarding instructions to assure that all requesting nodes eventually receive the requested data. If a requested cache line is either uncached or present only in the Shared state, the home node provides a copy of the cache node and resolves conflicts. In one embodiment, a blackout period after all responses until an acknowledgement message has been received allows all conflicting nodes to be aware of conflicts in which they are involved.",HUM HERBERT H J;;GOODMAN JAMES R;;BEERS ROBERT H;;GHUGHAL RAJNISH;;INTEL CORP,HUM HERBERT H J;;GOODMAN JAMES R;;BEERS ROBERT H;;GHUGHAL RAJNISH,,https://lens.org/039-995-098-754-672,Granted Patent,yes,68,4,16,16,0,G06F12/08;;G06F12/0831;;G06F12/0831;;G06F12/0826;;G06F12/0826;;G06F2212/622;;G06F2212/622,G06F15/16;;G06F17/30,709/206;;709/232,55,3,195-278-411-565-97X;;188-430-231-319-704;;049-072-663-106-748,10.1145/307338.301004;;10.1145/325164.325132;;10.1145/158439.158907,"The Authoritative Dictionary of IEEE Standard Terms 7th Edition, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc., pp. 217, 574, and 882, 2000.;;Wikipedia, ""Dynamic Random Access Memory,"" Revision as of Mar. 31, 2003, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-access-memory.;;Office Action from U.S. Appl.

Each power supply subunit comprises a lightweight, high-frequency, soft-switching power supply such as an FET inverter (Q1 - Q4, Fig 3) having a rectified output circuit (46). For arcjet systems comprising arcjet thrusters that do not operate simultaneously, relays 50, 52 are employed to switch between thrusters.

Pre-processing includes pre-rendering of the message into a final format, which final format is that which is displayed by the rendering engine to the user. The final format message is then converted to a text-only format to remove graphics, color, non-text decoration, and spacing that cannot be rendered as ASCII-style or Unicode-style characters.
