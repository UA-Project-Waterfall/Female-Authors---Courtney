The algorithm begins with a coarse initial partition of data records and continues by raising the similarity threshold until the threshold splits a given partition.

Output from the first burst detector can be used to control operation of a signal decoder that decodes received signals. The second burst detector analyzes output from the signal decoder to determine the second burst indicator. In other words, the first burst detector can be implemented prior to decoding the received signal to provide a first estimate related to the presence or absence of a burst.

Given the resolution of the causal alarm, remaining alarms (either all or a sub-set) may be resolved without further action.

C-3 hydroxy and NH groups are responsible contributing groups for their cytotoxicity. Mahanine reduced the doses of cisplatin and paclitaxel in cervical cancer showing better efficacy and useful as an adjunct chemotherapeutic agent to reduce toxicity these two drugs. A new cheap process for this preparation was established. EtOAc extract containing alkaloids enriched with mahanimbine and mahanine, is active against glioma and cervical cancers. Mahanine is targeting the chaperone Hsp90 which led to the proteasome-dependent degradation of several Hsp90-client proteins in diverse carcinoma types, glioblastoma, cervical carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma irrespective of their tissue origins thereby killing the cancer cells.",MANDAL CHITRA;;PAL BIKAS CHANDRA;;BHATTACHARYA KAUSHIK;;SAMANTA SUMAN KUMAR;;SARKAR SAYANTANI;;DAS RANJITA;;COUNCIL SCIENT IND RES,MANDAL CHITRA;;PAL BIKAS CHANDRA;;BHATTACHARYA KAUSHIK;;SAMANTA SUMAN KUMAR;;SARKAR SAYANTANI;;DAS RANJITA,COUNCIL OF SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH (2012-04-17),https://lens.org/042-592-593-596-351,Granted Patent,yes,4,1,2,2,0,A61K31/407;;C07D491/052;;A61K36/75;;A61K2236/39;;A61P35/00;;A61K31/407;;C07D491/052;;A61K2236/39;;A61K36/75,C07D491/052,548/421,9,7,041-703-940-947-068;;029-742-983-481-795;;113-931-831-788-98X;;086-630-459-308-583;;076-739-973-700-285;;079-095-125-687-936;;006-705-163-810-779,9544425;;10.1023/a:1005960822365;;10.1126/science.286.5439.531;;10521349;;19751707;;10.1016/j.bcp.2009.09.007;;17698033;;10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.08.005;;pmc1576126;;15753952;;10.1038/sj.bjp.0706137;;10.1016/j.bcp.2003.07.021;;14667927;;10.1002/pros.20415;;16683271,"Cancer and Metastasis Reviews (1998), 17(1), 91-106.;;Science (1999), vol. 286, 531-537.;;Cancer [online], [retrieved on Jul. 6, 2007].
