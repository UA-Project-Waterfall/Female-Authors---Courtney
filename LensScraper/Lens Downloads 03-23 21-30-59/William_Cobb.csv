If the walls are disassembled or moved, unsightly holes remain in the exposed bottom surfaces of the T-bars. A simple connector for solving the problem includes a strip of material which, in use, includes a generally inverted U-shaped central portion for straddling the top stem of the T-bar, and a pair of arms perpendicular to the central portion for extending outwardly beyond the arms of the T-bar into overlapping relationship with the channel member. Screws are used to connect the device to the T-bar and to the channel member. Thus, the T-bar remains intact and undamaged.",COBB WILLIAM,COBB WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/128-281-958-437-549,Granted Patent,yes,8,8,1,1,0,E04B2/825;;E04B9/008;;E04B2/825;;E04B9/008,E04B2/82;;E04B9/00,52/238.1;;52/241;;52/243.1,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Brazing; welding by fusion. UNITED KINGDOM ATOMIC ENERGY AUTHORITY. June 1, 1962 [June 13, 1961], No. 21260/61. Heading B3R. [Also in Divisions G1 and G6] A method of brazing an end closure member to a tubular member comprises producing a capillary film of braze metal between the members, the area of the joint being limited in two directions by spacing the members too far apart to allow capillary flow to take place. As seen in Fig. 1, the tube 1, in this case a stainless steel nuclear fuel can, has placed within its end a cup shaped cap 2 also of stainless steel. A ring of brazing material 4 is forced on to a peripheral shoulder 3 of the end cap, and the exterior of the ring 4 is a force fit in the tube 1. Brazing is achieved by placing the assembly in a vacuum chamber and heating to 1080-1100 C., when the brazing metal ring 4 melts and flows by capillary action to braze the end cap to the tube between the two annular shoulders 3, 5. The volume of the ring 4 is just sufficient to fill the capillary volume and form a small fillet about the shoulder 3. The brazed assembly is prepared for welding by rolling the cap to close the outermost gap 5 between the cap and tube. The edges are then sealed at 7 in Fig. 2 by a standard argon arc welding process. In a modification an annular hollow 8, Fig. 3, is left beneath the welded edges, and this hollow is filled with a tracer gas for checking the weld for leaks. The reservoir may be filled with tracer gas by incorporating this in the argon gas shield during the welding.",ATOMIC ENERGY AUTHORITY UK,LLOYD HENRY;;COBB HAROLD RALPH WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/004-567-726-532-130,Granted Patent,no,0,5,3,3,0,B23K1/20;;G21C3/10;;B23K2101/06;;Y02E30/30;;G21C3/10;;B23K1/20;;B23K2101/06;;Y02E30/30,B23K1/20;;G21C3/10,G1S SRK           SRK;;G6C C70Y          LA;;G6C C705          LA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

BRYCE FUEL INJECTION, Ltd. Oct. 31, 1952 [Nov. 8, 1951], No. 26189/51. Class 102 (1). A fuel injection pump delivery valve 2 hasdashpot mechanism to afford both a delayed opening of the valve to ensure rapid opening of the injector nozzle needle and a delayed closing to prevent dribble. The valve 2 slides over a cylindrical portion 1a of the valve seat member 1 and is urged into the closed position by a spring 3 housed in a connector 4 connected to the fuel delivery line. The valve member 2 has an axial fuel passage 1b leading from the pump chamber B and radial ducts Ic leading to a groove or port 1d in the wall of portion 1a. A restricted orifice 1e connects the passage 1b with the interior space V of the valve 2 and during the delivery stroke of the pump delays the opening of the valve until the pressure in space V is sufficient to lift the valve and open the port 1d. During closing of the valve, after the ports Id have been closed the fuel trapped in the space V escaping slowly through the orifice 1e acts as a dashpot to retard closing. In a modification the upper end of the passage 1b. is closed by a spring-loaded plate valve having a restricted groove in its underface. In another modification (Fig. 3) the valve 2 is a conical valve with a cylindrical skirt the space V below which acts as the damping chamber. Fuel passages 1b in the valve seat 1 communicate with a groove 1a that, due to a reduced portion 2a of the skirt, communicates with the fuel delivery line when the valve is open. A restricted orifice 1e may be provided between the pump chamber B and the space V or the valve skirt may have a central fuel passage 1b communicating with the groove 1d by a restricted radial.passage 1f. In yet another modification the valve skirt is fluted and carries a small pintle located with clearance in a hole in the valve seat member, the clearance acting as the restricted orifice.",BRYCE FUEL INJECTION LTD,GROSCHELL ERNEST RALPH;;COBB WILLIAM REGINALD;;GREEN GEOFFREY RALPH,,https://lens.org/166-736-662-880-652,Granted Patent,no,0,5,1,1,0,F02M59/462,F02M59/46,F1W WEEC          WEEC;;F1W W100          WEEC,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Selected features have tiles added nearby but also far enough away to improve uniformity in the effects of flare on the various features that are intended to be present in the photoresist.

   Photoresist on a wafer is exposed using tiles on a mask that improve flare performance. Features that are not to be exposed on the photoresist correspond to features on the mask. The various features are surrounded by other features that vary and thus affect flare differently. Selected features have tiles added nearby but also far enough away to improve uniformity in the effects of flare on the various features that are intended to be present in the photoresist. The tiles are made either very small in width or partially absorbing so that the tiles are not resolved in the photoresist. Thus the tiles reduce flare but do not alter the desired pattern in the photoresist.

The baffle surfaces and filter cage are configured such that during rotation of the cage, the media move relative to the baffle surfaces and turbulent flow of liquid when present in the filter is encouraged near the interior and/or exterior surface of the filter media. A drive means 307 is for rotating the cage. The filter unit is configured such that feed from the inlet is directed towards the interior of the cage, then passes through the media and exits as filtered liquid via the outlet.

The bag 12 is attached to a foamed cushion 16 at the bottom of the seat 12 in a vehicle and at least one pressure sensor is attached to the closed outlet port 22 of the bag 20. A temperature sensor 30 is arranged closely to the bag 20 and supplies a temperature signal. A controller 50 estimates the weight of the crew seating on the seat 12 based on the temperature signal from the temperature sensor 30 and a pressure signal from the pressure sensor. It is preferable to form the pressure sensor in such a way that the sensor can detect a gauge pressure (namely, the difference between the fluid pressure and atmospheric pressure) at the center of gravity of the fluid. Therefore, the weight estimating device can stably supply its output regardless of the variation of the direction of the bag 20 caused by the fluctuation of the atmospheric pressure or the pitching or rolling of the vehicle.",DELCO ELECTRONICS CORP,MURPHY MORGAN DANIEL;;ROE PAMELA ANN;;MYERS ROBERT JOSEPH;;PIPER WILLIAM LLOYD;;DUAN DONALD FORTUNE;;HAMID REZA BOOZABADI;;CARL EDWARD STONE;;MARK ROBERT VINCEN;;SULLIVAN STUART S;;ROBERT ALAN PERISHO JR;;ROBERT KEITH CONSTABLE;;GREGORY ALLEN COBB,,https://lens.org/055-560-382-543-757,Patent Application,no,0,1,14,14,0,B60R21/01516;;B60R21/01516;;B60N2/002;;B60N2/002;;B60R21/0152;;B60R21/0152;;G01G5/04;;G01G5/04;;G01G19/4142;;G01G19/4142;;G01L1/02;;G01L1/02,B60N2/00;;B60N2/90;;B60N5/00;;B60R21/01;;B60R21/015;;B60R21/16;;G01G5/04;;G01G5/06;;G01G19/414;;G01G19/52;;G01G23/48;;G01L1/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    An DPP EUV source is disclosed which may comprise a debris mitigation apparatus employing a metal halogen gas producing a metal halide from debris exiting the plasma. The EUV source may have a debris shield that may comprise a plurality of curvilinear shield members having inner and outer surfaces connected by light passages aligned to a focal point, which shield members may be alternated with open spaces between them and may have surfaces that form a circle in one axis of rotation and an ellipse in another. The electrodes may be supplied with a discharge pulse shaped to produce a modest current during the axial run out phase of the discharge and a peak occurring during the radial compression phase of the discharge. The light source may comprise a turbomolecular pump having an inlet connected to the generation chamber and operable to preferentially pump more of the source gas than the buffer gas from the chamber. The source may comprise a tuned electrically conductive electrode comprising: a differentially doped ceramic material doped in a first region to at least select electrical conductivity and in a second region at least to select thermal conductivity. The first region may be at or near the outer surface of the electrode structure and the ceramic material may be SiC or alumina and the dopant is BN or a metal oxide, including SiO or TiO ₂ . The source may comprise a moveable electrode assembly mount operative to move the electrode assembly mount from a replacement position to an operating position, with the moveable mount on a bellows. The source may have a temperature control mechanism operatively connected to the collector and operative to regulate the temperature of the respective shell members to maintain a temperature related geometry optimizing the glancing angle of incidence reflections from the respective shell members, or a mechanical positioner to position the shell members. The shells may be biased with a voltage. The debris shield may be fabricated using off focus laser radiation. The anode may be cooled with a hollow interior defining two coolant passages or porous metal defining the passages. The debris shield may be formed of pluralities of large, intermediate and small fins attached either to a mounting ring or hub or to each other with interlocking tabs that provide uniform separation and strengthening and do not block any significant amount of light.
