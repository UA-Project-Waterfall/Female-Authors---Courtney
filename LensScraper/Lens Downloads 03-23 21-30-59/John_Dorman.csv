The surfacing material can include a colorant or an aggregate of a pre-selected colour so as to provide an entire coloured surface or, in combination with a surfacing material of otherwise similar type which includes either no colorant or aggregate of a pre-selected colour or a colourant or aggregate of different colour, a surface having areas of different colour but of similar resilience and/or wearing characteristics. Thus it is possible to provide a surface material fabrication comprising a layer of the surfacing material deposited on a geotextile membrane serving to provide an impervious backing. Typically the layer serves to provide a generally porous volume above the impervious backing. Also, there can be provided a discrete load bearing structure having a surface bearing the surface material fabrication as aforesaid. Typically the layer of surfacing material is adapted to provide a porous body through which liquid deposited on the surface can percolate to a pre-determined level and thereafter passes through the material to one or more recovery locations for the liquid.",CHANT ROY BRERETON;;DORMAN MALCOLM JOHN,CHANT ROY BRERETON;;DORMAN MALCOLM JOHN,,https://lens.org/133-582-011-089-975,Patent Application,no,2,3,3,3,0,E01C5/18;;E01C7/34;;E01C13/065;;E01F9/524;;E04F15/12,E01C5/18;;E01C7/34;;E01C13/06;;E01F9/04;;E04F15/12,A6D DTN           DTN;;A6D D39X          D39;;E1G G60A1         G62;;E1G G60D          G62;;E1G G60N          G62;;E1G G60R          G62;;E1G G62           G62,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The eductor has a water stream flowing therethrough which establishes a vacuum pressure and draws the ClO2 from the reaction column into the water stream to form an aqueous ClO2 solution. The reaction chamber comprises a novel transition zone of increasing flow area wherein the precursor chemicals thoroughly mix resulting in conversion efficiencies of precursors into ClO2 of 95% and above.,SABRE OXIDATION TECHNOLOGIES I,MASON JOHN;;MITCHIM DORMAN;;KIELMAN GARY;;GRIFFIN WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/034-814-310-317-043,Granted Patent,no,0,0,20,20,0,B01J19/2415;;B01J19/26;;B01J2219/00162;;C01B11/024;;C01B11/02;;C01B11/024;;B01J2219/00162;;B01J19/26;;B01J19/2415,B01F1/00;;B01F3/04;;B01J19/24;;B01J19/26;;C01B11/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A liquid dispenser is provided for dispensing a desired amount of liquid from a bottle, without leakage or dripping. The bottle is mounted in a fixture attached to a wall. The bottle includes an inlet and an outlet, with one-way valves operatively sealed in the inlet and outlet ports. A foot pump is operatively connected to the inlet valve for the inlet port, such that air may be pumped into the bottle to pressurize the contents thereof. Upon pressurization, the liquid is forced through the outlet valve in the outlet port. An air filter is provided for the pump, so as to preclude contamination of liquid in the bottle.

The benefits derived from the design and deployment of the notification tool are primarily based in the efficient use of time and resources during periods of catastrophe and peril. The notification tool can be used by personnel not directly impacted by the emergency and to contact all individual patients simultaneously and/or in a short time period, overcoming the constraint of a call tree where one more operators dial patients sequentially.

    An apparatus for injecting a treatment chemical into an oil well produced using a subsurface pump, preferably a subsurface rotary pump, is described. Crude oil is pumped upward from a subsurface oil production zone through a central production pipe in the well. A small portion of produced fluid is diverted through a by-pass line interconnecting the production pipe and the annular space of the well between the production pipe and the well casing. A venturi nozzle comprising a throat of reduced diameter is mounted in the by-pass pipe. A suction pipe interconnects a chemical storage container containing a treatment chemical with the nozzle throat. Under the action of the venturi nozzle a suction pressure is created in the nozzle throat whereby the treatment chemical is drawn through the suction pipe and mixes with the fluid in the by-pass line thereby delivering the chemical to the well annulus. The chemical flows down the annulus under the action of gravity, mixes with the fluid in the well, and is drawn into the production pipe at the pump inlet thereby treating the fluid in the well.

    A solid-state chlorine dioxide generator for generating an aqueous solution of ClO _{ 2 } is formed within a block comprising an eductor for establishing a vacuum pressure and a reaction column for producing ClO _{ 2 } from precursor chemicals. The eductor has a water stream flowing therethrough which establishes a vacuum pressure and draws the ClO _{ 2 } from the reaction column into the water stream to form an aqueous ClO _{ 2 } solution. The reaction chamber comprises a novel transition zone of increasing flow area wherein the precursor chemicals thoroughly mix resulting in conversion efficiencies of precursors into ClO _{ 2 } of 95% and above.
