A body implantable unit develops an electrical stimulation signal and delivers that signal to an ocular rectus without restricting its contraction. In a preferred embodiment, the implanted unit includes a receiving member which cooperates with an external transmitting unit, the external transmitting unit establishing the stimulation signal parameters. Preferably, the stimulation signal is a periodically interrupted train of pulses, the repetition rate of the stimulation signal pulses being within the range of 50 to 100 pulses per minute. The interruption of the pulse train results in a stochastic stimulation with the pulse train being delivered for approximately 1 to 5 seconds with the interval between stimulation signals being from approximately 5 to 25 seconds. The pulse amplitude may be selectively established in the range from about 0.8 to 15 volts with the pulses having a pulse width of approximately 0.22 milliseconds. During stimulation, a divergence movement is attained to correct the ocular misalignment while chronic stimulation results in a histological and anatomical change in the stimulated rectus which also tends to overcome the ocular misalignment.",MEDTRONIC INC,FRIEDMAN HARRY G,FRIEDMAN HARRY G (1985-12-23),https://lens.org/163-206-312-909-999,Granted Patent,yes,2,30,4,4,0,A61F9/007;;A61N1/36046;;A61N1/36046;;A61F9/007,A61F9/007;;A61N1/36,A5R RHSX          HSX,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A body implantable unit develops an electrical stimulation signal and delivers that signal to an ocular rectus without restricting its contraction, In a preferred embodiment, the implanted unit includes a receiving member 15 which cooperates with an external transmitting unit, the external transmitting unit establishing the stimulation signal parameters. The receiving member 15 is connected to a lead 16 carrying an electrode 17 which is shaped so as to contact the ocular rectus 12 without interfering with its contraction. Preferably, the stimulation signal is a periodically interrupted train of pulses, the repetition rate of the stimulation signal pulses being within the range of 50 to 100 pulses per minute. The interruption of the pulse train results in a stochastic stimulation with the pulse train being delivered for approximately 1 to 5 seconds with the interval between stimulation signals being from approximately 5 to 25 seconds. The pulse amplitude may be selectively established in the range from about 0.8 to 15 volts with the pulses having a pulse width of approximately 0.22 milliseconds. During stimulation, a divergence movement is attained to correct the ocular misalignment while chronic stimulation results in a histological and an atomical change in the stimulated rectus which also tends to overcome the ocular misalignment.",MEDTRONIC INC,FRIEDMAN HARRY G,,https://lens.org/002-247-313-518-28X,Patent Application,yes,1,6,4,4,0,A61F9/007;;A61N1/36046;;A61N1/36046;;A61F9/007,A61F9/007;;A61N1/36,,1,1,020-339-450-078-605,10.1007/bf02477445;;4282864,"MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING, Vol. 12, No. 6, November 1974, Stevenage (GB) M.

    A method for operating an internal combustion engine and a corresponding device are described, reference pulses ( 45 ) being generated synchronously with respect to the cyclical movement of at least one part of the internal combustion engine. At least one event moment for the occurrence of at least one event is calculated by an output unit ( 24 ) at specific, definitively preset time intervals of the cyclical movement. Moreover, an independent clock-pulse generator ( 25 ) is provided which generates clock pulses, the interval of the clock pulses being independent of the movement, and the interval of the clock pulses being smaller than the intervals of the reference pulses. The at least one event moment is expressed as the number of clock pulses of the independent clock-pulse generator, and the at least one event is triggered upon reaching the number of clock pulses. By observing the clock pulses of the independent clock-pulse generator ( 25 ) counted between at least two successive reference pulses, a relationship value is formed which contains information about the future timing of the movement, this relationship value being used to alter the number of clock pulses.
