NORMALAIR-GARRETT Ltd. 6 Feb., 1970 [10 Feb., 1969], No. 7041/69. Heading F2P. A hose has an inside ply of flexible, inextensible material 22 and an impermeable outer ply 17 separated by a layer of foam 15, there being a flexible crushproof inner support 14 in the bore of the hose and end fittings 11, 12 attached to the inner ply 22 and having the outer ply 17 partially extending over them. As shown, the tube has an irregularly corrugated surface and the inner support 14 is a helical coil in the bore of the hose. Alternatively a flexible perforated tube also in the bore of the tube may be used. The foam 15 can be open or closed cells of polyurethane, the inner ply 22 of polyester fibre and the outer ply of a knitted polyester fibre coated with silicone rubber. In a method of manufacturing such a hose, Figs. 2-6B (not shown), the inner ply 22 is made integrally with the end fitting 12 to give assembly 16, a fabric cuff is fitted to one end of the inner support 14, which is then placed inside the inner ply 22 with the end fitting adjacent to the cuff, the second end fitting is secured to the inner ply 22 and the layers of foam 15 and outer ply 17 fitted, the latter being secured to the end fittings by heat and pressure. In one embodiment the spring 14 has one close coiled end and a cuff of polyester fibre 20 is secured to it using a diluted elastomeric adhesive by wrapping it over the coil when mounted on a mandrel 21. The end fitting 12 is made integrally with the inner ply 22 by sandwiching one end of the latter between layers of rubber 24, 25 built up on a pattern 23, the ribbon and inner ply's end are then subjected to heat and pressure by placing a mould around the covered pattern 23. The spring 14 with the cuff 20 is then inserted inside the inner ply 22 with the cuff 20 and end fitting 12 adjacent. End fitting 11 is then fitted to both the spring 14 and inner ply 22. A layer of polyurethane foam is wrapped to form a tube and joined to the ends of the inner ply by adhesive. The outer ply may be formed by skelping or convolutely winding a sheet of silicone rubber coated polyester fibre which is placed over the remainder of the hose by drawing the latter through it and sticking the outer ply 17 to the end fittings 11, 12.",NORMALAIR GARRETT LTD,FOOTE JAMES CONWAY;;TAYLOR JAMES CORNISH,,https://lens.org/012-683-470-880-155,Granted Patent,no,0,7,3,3,0,F16L9/21;;F16L11/118,F16L9/21;;F16L11/118,F2P PA13          PA13;;F2P P1A14         P1B7;;F2P P1A15B        P1B7;;F2P P1A16B        P1B7;;F2P P1A19D        P2A2;;F2P P1A9          P1B7;;F2P P1B7          P1B7;;F2P P2A2          P2A2;;F2P P2A4          P2A2,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Preston, E. J., and Conway, F. L. March 21. Intensifiers.-Relates to means for intensifying or reducing fluid pressure, one form for intensifying being shown in sectional elevation in Fig. 1. The low-pressure cylinder A has a ram C, of larger effective area than the ram D of the highpressure cylinder B. When fluid under slight pressure is allowed to flow from the main T through the pipe Q to the cylinder C, the rams are moved upwards, and fluid under high pressure passes from the cylinder B through the pipe V. The action is made automatic by providing the end of the ram D with a lug E adapted to operate the arms F, W of a counterpoised tripping-device G connected to a several-way cock H. In the position shown, fluid flows from the main 1 through the cock H and pipe K to the underside of the piston N, and the fluid above the piston exhausts through the pipe L and cock H. The piston thus holds the valve 0 so that fluid under slight pressure flows from the main T into the cylinder A, and under high pressure from the cylinder B through the pipe V, the high-pressure fluid being prevented by a non-return valve U from flowing through the pipe into the valvechest. When the position of the cock H is altered by the movement of the tripping-devices, the valve 0 is moved down, and fluid flows from the cylinder A through the pipe Q into the exhaust S. The high-pressure fluid may help the downward motion of the ram by flowing back through the pipe V, or this backward flow may be prevented by a valve in the pipe V, in which case fluid from the main T raises the valve U and flows into the cylinder B. In modifications, the tripping-device may operate directly the valve 0, and, where the apparatus is employed for reducing-pressure, the pipe V leads from the low-pressure cylinder A, the valve U is dispensed with, and the valve 0 is set to allow the fluid in the cylinder B to compress the fluid in the cylinder A.",PRESTON EDWIN JAMES;;CONWAY FRANK LLOYD,PRESTON EDWIN JAMES;;CONWAY FRANK LLOYD,,https://lens.org/024-023-421-368-595,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The modification is such that the filaments (or parts thereof or fibres cut therefrom into staple length and perhaps crimped) undergo a corresponding variable change of length by shrinkage or extension when subjected to a uniform length-changing treatment e.g. wet or dry heating or chemical treatment of relaxed or tensioned-filaments at the fibre or (single or plied) yarn stage. The difference in modification extends longitudinally of each filament and/or between different filaments. Individual stapled fibres may have a shrinkage characteristic which varies from a maximum at one end to a minimum at the other end. Staple derived from separately prepared tows, p the filaments of which may differ as regards chemical nature, form and/or denier, may be blended and spun into yarn. A bulky fabric comprises polyacrylinitrile fibres bonded with rubber latex and then subjected to a steam treatment to induce differential shrinkage within and/or between the fibres. In apparatus for subjecting viscose filaments to a variable liquid treatment, Fig. 3 (not shown) the tow passes through a bath 19 containing a water-soluble ethylene urea formaldehyde precondensate and a resinifying catalyst such as magnesium or ammonium chloride, thence through driven nip rollers 20 the squeeze pressure between which is varied (by mechanism comprising rotating arm 23, lever 22 and loading spring 21) so as to effect a variable expression of the bath liquid: alternatively or additionally, the resin concentration of the liquid may be varied. The tow then passes through a curing oven 24, water and finish solution baths 25 and 26 and a drier 27. Staple fibre yarn produced from the resultant filaments is immersed in a shrinking agent e.g. aqueous caustic soda solution, and the yarn thus bulked may be stabilized by cross-linkage or the application of a crease-resistant resin. In the stapling apparatus of Fig. 4 (not shown) polyacrylic tow is fed between rollers 35, 36, and 37, 38. Roller 37 is of rubber and roller 38 is surfaced with rubber, carries cutters 39 and rotates eccentrically so that each cut fibre is relaxed in a continuous variable manner from 0-20% from end to end. Steam and cooling air are directed on to the tow by jets 40 and 41. Yarn spun from this staple and heat-treated develops a structure varying from open on the outer surface to compact at the core. In another apparatus, Fig. 5 (not shown) the tow is stapled by a traversing cutter 42 trailing a steam nozzle 43:yarn spun from the staple and heat-treated shows a sharply defined transition from a compact core to a loose surface.",LINEN IND RES ASS,RUDDELL JAMES NELSON;;TODD HERBERT ALEXANDER CONWAY,,https://lens.org/067-496-973-710-846,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,11,0,D02G1/18;;D01G99/00;;D02J1/22,D01G99/00;;D02G1/18,B5B B31Y          26;;B5B B312          26;;B5B B660          26;;B5B B76Y          26;;B5B B801          26;;D1F FX            -;;D1F F21           -;;D1F F51           FZ.F;;D1R RDB           RDB;;D1R R105          RDB;;D1R R3A2G1        R3D2;;D1R R3B1          R3D2;;D1R R3C2A         R3D2;;D1R R3C2F         R3D2;;D1R R3C2Y         R3D2;;D1R R3C5A         R3D2;;D1R R3C5B         R3D2;;D1R R3D1AY        R3D2;;D1R R3D1A2A1      R3D2;;D1R R3D1A3A       R3D2;;D1R R3D3E         R3D2;;D1R R3D3J         R3D2;;D1R R3D3X         R3D2;;D1R R306          RDB;;D1R R307          RDB;;D1R R350          RDB;;D1R R351          RDB;;D1R R352          RDB;;D1R R503          RDB;;D1R R507          RDB;;D1R R508          RDB;;D1R R546          RDB;;D1R R551          RDB;;D1R R556          RDB;;D1R R651          RDB;;D1W W1            -;;D1W W3            -;;D1W W5            -;;D1W W7A           -;;D1W W7B           -;;D1W W7C           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

An assembly of textile fibres some at least of which have been produced by highly stretching and then severing continuous filaments into staple fibres having high potential shrinkage receives a heat treatment in which different parts of the assembly are subjected to different temperatures so that the highly stretched fibres have variable shrinkage characteristics and a yarn made from the assembly bulks when subjected to a shrinking process. Different parts of the assembly may be subjected to discrete temperatures-for example, room temperature and a temperature producing maximum shrinkage-or to temperatures varying within a given range. In one embodiment a sliver is passed on a lattice through an air curtain comprised of air of two temperatures mixed by a rotary valve which is rotated by a motor to vary the mixture. In a second embodiment a sliver is laid in a zigzag manner on a perforated conveyor which passes through a hot air box which is divided laterally of the conveyor into a plurality of compartments each having a fan and an electric heater-the heaters having different ratings. In a third embodiment the sliver is drawn through a fluidised bed having a variable temperature. The assembly may be heated in the presence of moisture.

[Also in Division B5] In the production of bulked yarn, drawn, wholly synthetic e.g. polyacrylic, thermoplastic, continuous filaments are simultaneously and variably stretched (as they are produced from a spinneret or subsequently) by passage of a sheet of the filaments through a drawing apparatus comprising two pairs of similarly dimensioned and driven, but oppositely disposed, conical rollers linked by mechanism which repeatedly causes the rollers to separate in turn so that the pairs alternately grip and effect stretching of the filaments. All or most of the filaments are thus stretched by varying amounts along their length (dependent on the speed of the rollers and the frequency of transfer of effective operation from one pair to the other) and also across the sheet. The filaments are twisted into a yarn which is subjected to a uniform heat shrinkage treatment to bulk the yarn as a result of differential shrinkage effects within and between the filaments. The effect may be further varied by changing the twist.",LINEN IND RES ASS,RUDDELL JAMES NELSON;;TODD HERBERT ALEXANDER CONWAY,,https://lens.org/161-617-304-780-690,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,D02G1/18,D02G1/18,B5B B350          13;;B5B B436          13;;B5B B609          13;;B5B B714          13;;B5B B72Y          13;;B5B B725          13;;D1F FX            -;;D1F F51           FZ.F;;D1W W1            -;;D1W W3            -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

GAS COUNCIL. 6 Oct., 1967 [6 Oct., 1966], No. 44733/66. Heading C5E. Methane - containing gas is made by introducing powdered raw coal into a recycling bed of non-coking material at 600‹ to 1000‹ C. fluidized by an hydrogenating gas suitably at a pressure of 10 to 200 atmos., the rate of introduction of the coal into the bed being such that the coal is rapidly heated, at least partially hydrogenated, and converted to a non- coking condition. The residue of non-coking powdered char may be subsequently hydrogenated under more severe conditions to produce more methane and a residue which may be used for hydrogen manufacture. Inside the cylindrical reaction vessel 3 is a cylinder 4 mounted coaxially and spaced from a shorter cylinder 5 by a gap 6. The fluidized solids are caused to circulate up the cylinder 4 and down the annulus between 3 and 4 by passing most of the hydrogen through the pipe 10 into the chamber 7 and thence into the central tube 4. A smaller amount of hydrogen is passed through the pipe 11 to fluidize the descending solid particles. To start the process the bed is formed from a non- coking fluidizable solid, e.g. high or medium temperature coke, which is gradually displaced as the bed is continuously withdrawn through pipe 14 while powdered coal is fed to the bed, through pipe 12, entrained in gas. Both the coal and the hydrogen may be preheated. Additional heat may be obtained by simultaneously carrying out other reactions in the bed, e.g. an oxygen containing gas may be added or a light petroleum distillate can be fed and hydrogenated.",GAS COUNCIL,DENT FREDERICK JAMES;;THOMPSON BRIAN HOYLE;;CONWAY HENRY LAWRENCE,,https://lens.org/049-192-405-655-652,Granted Patent,no,0,3,1,1,0,C10B49/08,C10B49/08,C5E EA21          -;;C5E EA25B         -;;C5E EA25C         -;;C5E EA26B         -;;C5E EA28          -;;C5E EA30          -;;C5E ED2A3         ED2;;C5E ED2B2B2       ED2;;C5E ED2B2B4       ED2;;C5E ED2B2B5       ED2;;C5E ED2B2C        ED2;;C5E ED2B2D2       ED2,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The computer 120 stores schedules of G-suit inflation pressure against increasing acceleration Gz and decreasing cabin ambient pressure PAMB and outputs the higher to the ECO. The ECU compares an existing G-suit inflation pressure P0 signal with the inflation pressure demand signal and generates a compensated error signal which is combined with the inflation pressure demand signal to provide the servodemand signal. Servo-pressure is regulated by a torque motor controlled valve 124, 125 which receives a servo-demand signal from the ECU 123 and controls movement of inflation gas supply and vent valves 126 and 127, respectively.

    A control unit is set up to operate a target device by receiving a first input for selecting from a plurality of protocols stored in the control unit a protocol that is appropriate for communicating with the target device. The control unit is then caused to transmit to the target device, using the selected protocol, a request for configuration information. In response to the receipt of the request, the target device returns to the control unit a function indicator and the control unit selects from a plurality of commands appropriate for the target device stored in the control unit a command corresponding to the function indicator. The selected command is mapped to a function key of the control unit such that activation of the function key results in communication of the selected command using the selected protocol to the target device to thereby control a function supported by the target device that is represented by the function indicator. The function indicator may alternatively be a code that indicates to the control unit that data following the code is a definition of a new infrared code and a corresponding key annotation.

One method includes the steps of having the devices to be controlled provide a listing of the capabilities of each device, recognizing a single set of standard abstract feature indicators; processing said indicators; and, mapping said indicators into specific IR codes and keys according to said list of capabilities of said controlled device. One embodiment is optimized for use with a virtual remote control, wherein only icons corresponding to related capabilities is displayed on a touch screen of the virtual remote control. Such an embodiment is particularly well suited for controlling different families of function capability associated with correspondingly different entertainment devices to achieve an integrated entertainment, or task, grouping. Reduction of the icons displayed to the user perforce reduces the apparent complexity of the remote with which the devices are controlled.

The local publisher program (230) sends the data to a publish/subscribe broker (300) running on a different data processing system (130). The broker can retain the most recent publications for analysis by one or more subscribers. This avoids the need to save large amounts of data to disk storage on the storage-constrained apparatus, and ensures that console output data and log data that is often discarded by headless, storage-constrained systems is available for analysis.

SOLUTION: Values of stiffnesses of two or more different partial sets of one set of bristles are experimentally decided. This method includes a calculation of a change of the stiffness based on the value of the stiffness experimentally decided in advance. Further, if the stiffness calculated in advance exceeds a predetermined stiffness change criterion, it is confirmed that there is a defect in brush sealing. That is, if the apparatus 10 for deciding a defect in the brush sealing decides no defect in the sealing 12, the sealing 12 is suitable for using initially or continuously. If the apparatus 10 decides the defect in the sealing 12, the sealing 12 is sent to a scrap pile or a recycle bottle.

Log data output by an application program running on a storage-constrained apparatus is saved to local system memory—either as an in-memory data file or as output from one application piped to the input of another, or as a named pipe that passes data to a local publisher program—and then captured by the local publisher program. The local publisher program sends the data to a publish/subscribe broker, which can retain the most recent publications for analysis by one or more subscribers. This avoids the need to save large amounts of data to disk storage on the storage-constrained apparatus, and ensures that console output data and log data that is often discarded by headless, storage-constrained systems is available for analysis. The combination of the retain feature and publishing of output data in response to failure of a monitoring application ensures the availability of the data that was output just before the failure, which is generally the most useful data for problem diagnosis.",IBM,BEDI BHARAT VEER;;CONWAY-JONES DAVID C;;LOCKE DAVID;;STANFORD-CLARK ANDREW JAMES,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (2008-05-17),https://lens.org/095-851-476-595-479,Patent Application,yes,8,31,8,8,0,G06F11/2294;;G06F11/3476;;G06F11/2294;;G06F11/3476,G06F15/16,709/224,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

    One method empirically determines a stiffness value for each of two or more different subsets of the bristles of a brush seal, then calculates a variation in stiffness, and then identifies the brush seal as defective if the calculated variation in stiffness exceeds a predetermined stiffness variation criteria. One apparatus includes a load transducer having a contact head sized to contact less than twenty percent of the bristles, a displacement transducer which measures the displacement of the free ends of the contacted bristles, and a clamp for securing the brush seal and presenting the bristles for contact.

Wherein amplification is at least 200-fold over amount of input rAAV vector at each passage. Suitable promoters include p5, p19, p40, hCMV, HSV-1 tk, CMV40, HIV LTR, HCMV IE and HSV-1 IE 110 promoter. The defective herpes virus may be d27.1rc or a herpes simplex virus.

   This invention relates to a spring fastener, which comprises engagement springs in opposite sides of the fastener. Each engagement spring has an engagement region comprising a hindrance portion, which increases considerably the removal to insertion force ratio as compared to such ratio in the absence of the hindrance portion, thus permitting very easy insertion with considerably more difficult removal of the fastener from the slot of a panel, which provides an efficient ergonomically balanced removal to insertion force ratio. The hindrance portion comprises ripples or other hindrance elements of unexpectedly minute dimensions for providing this efficient ergonomic force balance.

Each engagement spring has an engagement region comprising a hindrance portion, which increases considerably the removal to insertion force ratio as compared to such ratio in the absence of the hindrance portion, thus permitting very easy insertion with considerably more difficult removal of the fastener from the slot of a panel, which provides an efficient ergonomically balanced removal to insertion force ratio. The hindrance portion comprises ripples or other hindrance elements of unexpectedly minute dimensions for providing this efficient ergonomic force balance. The combination of the above structures with the presence of barbs being bent at their front portion improves immensely the ergonomic character of the devices.

Applying rotation directly to the lead in turn causes rotation of the stylet. Where the stylet has a bent tip for purposes of steering the lead, the rotation applied to the lead rotates the bent tip so that the lead can be steered by rotating the lead rather than rotating a hub of the stylet. The rotational coupling may be achieved through one or more features provided for the lead and/or the stylet, such as a feature within a lumen of the lead that mates to a feature along the stylet or a feature of the stylet hub that engages the proximal end of the lead.

Se proporciona un procedimiento para la producción del clorhidrato de valaciclovir en una forma cristalina anhidra que incluye substancialmente una configuración del espaciado d (en Angstroms) determinada. El procedimiento se caracteriza porque comprende los siguientes pasos: a) formar el valaciclovir en solución ya sea en la base libre o en la forma de la sal; b) convertir el valaciclovir de la base libre o la sal del mismo al clorhidrato de valaciclovir; c) aislar el clorhidrato de valaciclovir de la solución y opcionalmente remover el solvente no unido, dejando el clorhidrato de valaciclovir en la forma substancialmente seca; d) tratar el clorhidrato de valaciclovir con 15% a 40% p/p de un alcohol inferior que tiene 1 a 4 átomos de carbono o de una cetona inferior que contiene desde 3 hasta 6 átomos de carbono que sirve para convertir una cantidad del clorhidrato del valaciclovir secado opcionalmente en la forma cristalina anhidra; y e) aislar la forma cristalina anhidra. El solvente es preferiblemente un solvente orgánico soluble an agua, que debe ser los suficientemente solubilizante y debe ser empleado en una cantidad que permita la solubilización parcial para efectuar la conversión y la precipitación, por ejemplo de la forma cristalina hidratada hasta la forma cristalina anhidra deseada del clorhidrato del valaciclovir. Preferiblemente el solvente orgánico es un alcohol, ventajosamente un alcohol inferior que contiene 1 a 4 átomos de carbono (etanol o un solvente compuesto substancialmente de etanol), o una cetona inferior que contiene 3 a 6 átomos de carbono y contiene agua (acetona acuosa con un contenido de agua de 6% hasta 12% en peso aproximadamente). En un segundo aspecto de la invención se proporciona un clorhidrato de valaciclovir que tiene un contenido de agua de hidratación de no más de 3% en peso (p/p).",WELLCOME FOUND,VARLASHKIN PETER GREGORY;;WINNIKE RICHARD AUGUSTUS;;WHATRUP DAVID JAMES;;PARTIN JANE MUSE;;SKINNER DAVID MICHAEL;;LAKE PHILIP GEORGE;;CONWAY GREGORY ALAN;;III WILLIAM BAYNE GRUBB;;CARTER BARRY HOWARD,,https://lens.org/106-167-478-073-566,Patent Application,no,0,0,64,65,0,C07D473/00;;A61P31/12;;A61P31/22;;C07D473/00;;A61K31/52;;C07D473/00,C07D473/18;;A61K31/52;;A61K31/522;;A61P31/12;;A61P31/22;;C07D473/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The blood collection set is formed with a venting mechanism that permits an outflow of the air, while blocking an outflow of blood or other fluids. Thus, the flow of collected blood is prevented from being blocked by the air inside the tube. Then, greater flash visualization on venous entry is taken into consideration, the discharge of the air existing in interior portions of the blood collection set is made possible, and the need to employ a discard tube is avoided. <P>COPYRIGHT: (C)2006,JPO&NCIPI",BECTON DICKINSON CO,NAIR HAREESH;;SWENSON KIRK D;;CONWAY HUGH T;;NEWBY C MARK;;BLOCH CURTIS;;LEVY RICHARD;;WILKINSON BRADLEY;;SCHNEIDER JAMES C;;TOWNS BRYAN;;ISKRA MICHAEL;;ELLIS ROBERT;;BENNETT MICHAEL;;MARSDEN STEWART,,https://lens.org/072-503-622-807-033,Patent Application,no,4,7,9,9,0,A61B5/15003;;A61B5/150213;;A61B5/150221;;A61B5/150389;;A61B5/150519;;A61B5/150572;;A61B5/150732;;A61B5/15074;;A61B5/1545;;A61B5/1545;;A61B5/15074;;A61B5/150389;;A61B5/150221;;A61B5/150519;;A61B5/150572;;A61B5/150213;;A61B5/150732;;A61B5/15003,A61B5/145;;A61B5/15;;B65D81/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING
