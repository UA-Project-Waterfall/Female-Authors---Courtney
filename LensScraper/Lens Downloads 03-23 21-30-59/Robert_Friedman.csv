The acid solution is effective to extract and remove polyvalent metal ions from the formation material. Next an acidified resin emulsion composition comprising an oil soluble, acid stable resin is injected into the formation. The resin emulsion traverses the washed region without plugging. When the resin reaches the outer edge of the washed region the acidified emulsion extracts metal ions adsorbed to the unwashed formation material. The extracted polyvalent metal ions are effective to demulsify and coalesce the resin, thereby establishing a relatively impermeable barrier to subsequent fluid flow.

The receiving terminal accepts the plurality of signals simultaneously from a possible plurality of satellites, combining the subchannels comprising the virtual channel into the original signal content as if conducted via a single channel. The receiving antenna system receives satellite subchannel signals from a plurality of directions using multiple antennas or a single antenna with multi-direction capability. Prior to signal combining, the receiver necessarily time-synchronizes the plurality of subchannels by introducing time delay in some channels before combining the subsignals into the original composite. A timing signal present in the virtual satellite system assists the receiver in determining the amount of delay to apply to each incoming signal. The timing signal is either a separate carrier or an additional modulation on the existing information-bearing carrier.

NATIONAL MACHINERY CO. Dec. 30, 1952, No. 32961/52. Class 106 (2) A strain gauge of the type in which the load in a forging press 1 is measured by the strain in the frame comprises a bar 10 pivotally anchored at 8 in line with the axis 7 of the crank shaft 3, and co-operating at its lower end with an indicator 13 carried on a fixed mounting 12 so that movement of the bar 10, when the frame ,of the press is elongated with the strain, is transmitted to the dial indicator 13 through an amplifying lever system. The lower fixed support 12 is provided with a mounting 12a for the dial indicator 13, the movable member of which 16, is in contact with one end of the lever 18. The lever 18 is pivoted on the lower end of the bar 10 at 19 and the end of the -lever 18 remote from the indicator member 16 is urged into contact with a fixed pin 14 in the frame of the press by a spring 20. The bar .10 is provided with a large clearance hole 15 so that the movement of the bar 10 is not prevented by the pin 14. Movement of the bar 10 causes displacement of the pivot 19 of the lever 18 relative to the fixed pin 14 and thereby causes partial rotation of the lever 18 with consequent .linear displacement of the dial indicator member 16. The magnitude of the movement of the lever 18 and dial indicator member 16 may be varied by adjustment of the bar 10 in relation to the fixed stop 14 thereby varying the ratio of the turns of the lever 18. Adjustment of the arm 10 is effected by means of a clearance aperture 21 into which penetrate two adjusting screws 23, 24, co-operating with a fixed pin 22 on the frame of the press which also .penetrates into the clearance aperture 21.",NAT MACHINERY CO,FRIEDMAN ROBERT GEORGE,,https://lens.org/014-465-777-907-348,Granted Patent,no,0,3,1,1,0,B21J9/18;;B30B15/0094,B21J9/18;;B30B15/00,G1M MCCH          MCCH;;G1M M11C          MCCH;;G1M M12E          MCCH,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The oxidation is conducted using a liquid phase solvent for the organic fractions removed from the kerogen. Preferred solvents are naphthalene, tetralin and phenanthracene. The solventorganic fraction solution is then separated into solvent and organic fraction by sublimation with the solvent being recycled. The residual solids comprising oil shale material and unoxidized kerogen is then subjected to a bake-off to recover additional organic material from the kerogen. In addition to recovering a portion of the organic content from the kerogen, the oxidative scission reaction increases the susceptibility of the kerogen to recovery by pyrolysis under milder conditions than the unoxidized oil shale material.

   A satellite communications system provides an information channel between remotely located transmitters and receivers. A virtual satellite system provides the same service, but divides the signal either in power or in data content into subchannels such that any particular signal is conducted to the intended receiver via a plurality of traditional satellite channels. The receiving terminal accepts the plurality of signals simultaneously from a possible plurality of satellites, combining the subchannels comprising the virtual channel into the original signal content as if conducted via a single channel. The receiving antenna system receives satellite subchannel signals from a plurality of directions using multiple antennas or a single antenna with multi-direction capability. Prior to signal combining, the receiver necessarily time-synchronizes the plurality of subchannels by introducing time delay in some channels before combining the subsignals into the original composite. A timing signal present in the virtual satellite system assists the receiver in determining the amount of delay to apply to each incoming signal. The timing signal is either a separate carrier or an additional modulation on the existing information-bearing carrier.

Disc brakes. NATIONAL MACHINERY CO. Feb. 18, 1954, No. 4775/54. Class 103 (1). In a disc brake for metal working presses and similar machines, a rotatable member having an annular surface overlaps a fixed brake ring and forms a brake surface and comprises means including a stationary resilient metal diaphragm which extends radially inwardly to overlap the opposite annular surface of the rotatable member, means being provided to move the overlapping portion of the diaphram towards and away from the fixed brake ring to frictionally grip and release the rotatable member. In the construction illustrated in which Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 are sections on the planes 2, 2 and 4, 4 of Fig. 1 respectively, the crankshaft 6 of a metal forging press projects from the bed frame of the press 5 and the brake is supported on four spaced lugs 7 carried by the bed frame. Keyed to the crankshaft at 9 is a member 10 which carries a friction disc 13, provided with friction material 34 on its radial surfaces slidable axially to the member 10 on splines 11. The brake actuation mechanism is composed of several ring and spacer elements which are held in intimate contact by the bolts 14 and 16 to form a rigid non-rotatable assembly. Situated adjacent to the lugs 7 is a laminated fixed base ring 17 which has formed in it a totally enclosed annular groove 18 in which a coolant, such as water, may be circulated. Adjacent the base ring are a plurality of intermediate spacers 22. An apertured metal diaphragm 24 is compressed along the outer edge of the annular support ring 23 and the outer spacers 26 which abut against the annular fluid pressure cylinder 25. An annular pressure plate 27 together with an annular ring shoe 29 is clamped against the opposing radial surfaces of the diaphragm 24 along its inner edge and are axially movable due to the inherent axial flexibility of the diaphragm 24 under the influence of the compression springs 32 which cause the ring shoe 29 to frictionally engage the friction disc 13 and retard the shaft 6. A groove 30 is formed in the outer face of the ring shoe 29 to form a fluid passage through which a coolant may be circulated. When brake fluid (preferably air) is admitted into the cylinder 25 via inlet 38 and header 38a, the fluid pressure causes the piston 36 to move axially away from the cylinder which, in turn, through the bolts 39, causes the pressure plate to move in the same direction compressing the brake-applying springs 32 to disengage the ring shoe 29 from the friction disc. In place of a single friction disc 13 a series of rotatable friction discs could be spaced between intermediate non-rotatable rings.

The emulsion also contains an ester such as ethyl monochloroacetate or ethyl acetate and a dibasic acid such as ethylenediamine. The composition is injected into the formation. The ester hydrolyzes, reducing the pH which destabilizes the emulsion and causes the nitrile rubber to coat the sand grains. The strength of the rubber matrix binding the sand grains together is increased by cross-linking which is enhanced by the ethylene­diamine. Other cross-linking additives including zinc sulfate and colloidal sulfur may also be incorporated into the formu­lation to increase the degree of cross-linking and hence the ultimate strength and durability of the rubber-consolidated sand mass.

The method comprises formulating a water-external phase emulsion containing as the dispersed phase, an oil insoluble rubber, preferably a nitrile or carboxylated nitrile rubber. The emulsion also contains an ester such as ethyl monochloroacetate or ethyl acetate and a dibasic acid such as ethylenediamine. The composition is injected into the formation. The ester hydrolyzes, reducing the pH which destabilizes the emulsion and causes the nitrile rubber to coat the sand grains.

    A satellite communications system provides an information channel between remotely located transmitters and receivers. A virtual satellite system provides the same service, but divides the signal either in power or in data content into subchannels such that any particular signal is conducted to the intended receiver via a plurality of traditional satellite channels. The receiving terminal accepts the plurality of signals simultaneously from a possible plurality of satellites, combining the subchannels comprising the virtual channel into the original signal content as if conducted via a single channel. The receiving antenna system receives satellite subchannel signals from a plurality of directions using multiple antennas or a single antenna with multi-direction capability. Prior to signal combining, the receiver necessarily time- synchronizes the plurality of subchannels by introducing time delay in some channels before combining the subsignals into the original composite. A timing signal present in the virtual satellite system assists the receiver in determining the amount of delay to apply to each incoming signal. The timing signal is either a separate carrier or an additional modulation on the existing information-bearing carrier.

The temperature sensor includes two Proportional To Absolute Temperature (PTAT) current sources that generate PTAT currents and two transistors which conduct the PTAT currents with different current densities to establish a basic voltage PTAT across a resistor. An offset resistor coupled between the bases of the two transistors and a circuit node, shifts the basic PTAT voltage by an offset voltage. A first gain circuit couples to the collector of the first transistor and the offset resistor and generates a servo current (i.e., a current that tends to move the circuit to the desired state by correcting an error) to servo the base of the first transistor when there is a difference between the first transistor's collector current and the PTAT current. A second gain circuit generates a second servo current to servo the emitter of the second transistor when there is a difference between the second transistor's collector current and the PTAT current. These servo currents drive the two transistors such that the second gain circuit generates a temperature related output voltage shifted from the basic voltage PTAT by the offset voltage, and which follows a predetermined temperature scale and has a substantially linear function with a desired offset temperature.",NAT SEMICONDUCTOR CORP,FRIEDMAN JAY;;PEASE ROBERT ALLEN,NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION (1998-07-27),https://lens.org/019-184-181-382-211,Granted Patent,yes,3,31,1,1,0,G05F3/222;;G05F3/265;;G05F3/265;;G05F3/222,G05F3/22;;G05F3/26;;G05F5/08,327/513;;327/512;;323/314,1,1,083-197-347-223-776,10.1109/jssc.1984.1052253,"Pease, Robert A., A New Fahrenheit Temperature Sensor , IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, vol.

The barrier may be a cone or pancake shaped barrier below the perforation to prevent bottom water coning, or a cylindrical barrier may be formed opposite portions of the well perforations. An aqueous hydrcarbon emulsion treating fluid is used which comprises a hydrocarbon, water and surfactant, whose pH is in the rqnge of from 2 to 6 and preferably adjusted to a level determined experimentally to cause precipitation of hydrocarbon after exposure to the formation from 7 to 14 days. First the emulsion and then the displacement fluid are injected into the formation at a predetermined injection rate which causes the polyvalent metal ions to be extracted from said formation and accumulated in the treating fluid at a controlled rate.

The method comprises formulating a treating fluid containing a compound which undergoes acid catalyzed polymerization, preferably an oligomer of furfuryl alcohol, and an anhydride of a strong acid such as phosphorous tribromide mixed in a suitable diluent such as methyl isobutyl ketone. The composition is injected into the formation. The anhydride reacts with trace amounts of water forming an acid which catalyzes the polymer. Polymerization produces more water to react with additional anhydride. The water content of the treating zone must be less than five percent by volume based on the volume of the pore volume of the treating zone, which usually requires a pre-treatment to remove water from the treatment zone, such as a preflush with a non aqueous fluid.

Cased wells may be treated to plug holes in the casing caused by corrosion or casing breaks by introducing a treating fluid into the formation adjacent to the break. The treating fluid comprises a material which can be acid catalyzed in a period of from 1 to 16 hours at formation conditions, preferably a monomer or oligomer of furfuryl alcohol.

The acid and concentration of acid are selected to produce a set time at the formation temperature in the range of from 1 to 16 hours, so the treating fluid will flow into and saturate the pore space of the portion of the formation being treated.

Instantaneous frequency switching is achieved by changing an oscillator tuning word (OTW) to imitate the three oscillators of a UWB transmitter. In one embodiment, the DCO can change the frequency instantaneously within 1/fT of the varator devices used to construct the DCO. An all digital phase lock loop (ADPLL) (200) is used for offline calibration prior to the start of packet transmission or reception. Any phase shift during the switching is tracked by a digital circuit in the transmitter.

Programmed electric control: automatic speed control systems. NORTH AMERICAN ROCKWELL CORP. April 4, 1968 [April 5, 1967], No.16335/68. Headings G3N and G3R. Programmed Electric Control, Fig. 3. A programmed control arrangement for welding particularly for pipe welding of the gas or electric type comprises a transparent table 35 supporting a Mylar sheet 40, 41 containing opaque indicia. A carriage containing a plurality of photo-cells is moved across the sheet at a constant speed or a speed synchronized with welding electrode movement. In electric welding the path of a tape 91 would be indicative of arc welding current which is maintained at determined values by a closed loop control circuit controlling a phase controlled thyristor arrangement. The various operations i.e. wire speed electrode movement, and an H.F. arc starting circuit are controlled by other opaque tapes 192-196. In the case of pipe welding the arrangement may control a pre-heating run before the welding proper is commenced, and normally only after this time has elapsed, the carriage is switched over to run synchronously with the electrode movement. Automatic Speed Control Fig.9. In an automatic speed control system wherein a D.C. shunt motor is fed with variable width pulses, the motor current is maintained at its maximum or minimum value during speed deviations to obtain a high restoration rate. A constant current set point signal, which may be derived from a circuit illustrated in Fig.6 (not shown), is applied through terminal 127 to a constant current circuit 122 which charges a capacitor 141, which at a determined voltage fires a unijunction transistor 143 rendering a transistor 142 conductive shunting the emitter of transistor 143 to earth. At the same time capacitor 141 is discharged and applies a negative pulse through a capacitor 146 to momentarily turn off a transistor 147 hence a positive pulse is applied through a capacitor 148 to fire a thyristor 149. This turns on a transistor 151 in series with the motor which is connected to lead 153. Attached to the motor shaft is a wheel having slots admitting light to a photo-sensitive thyristor 160 responsive to either light or a gating current. When no light reaches the thyristor 160 a capacitor 162 is charged through a transistor 161 and a 1K resistor. When light reaches thyristor 160 it is fired which simultaneously discharges capacitor 162 through a diode 165, and renders a transistor 166 conductive which turns off thyristor 149. When capacitor 162 is discharged, a transistor 164 is turned off applying a pulse over lead 167 to an overspeed circuit 124. Under speed control is accomplished by placing a clamp on the emitter of transistor 143 which restricts the voltage to just less than the triggering voltage of this transistor, hence it will not trigger. As soon as thyristor 149 is turned off the clamp is removed hence the capacitor 141 voltage rises and transistor 143 conducts thus turning the motor current on almost instantaneously.

A virtual device driver (22) monitors calls from and returns to the file manager to identify any references to files which have been previously stored in the drivers (22) database or lookup table, the driver (22) modifies the calls or returns effectively to render the file invisible. The user thus is not able to open the file or manipulate it in any way, and is not able to see the file in a directory listing. Thus, the user is not able to learn of the existence of the cloaked file (16). Selection of files for storage in the driver (22) database or lookup table is password protected to ensure that the authorized user may de-select and de-cloak the files at a later time as desired. The method and apparatus also permits restrictive use of files by monitoring the type of process identified in the call and by the type of action or procedure within the process that is to be performed. Thus, only selected application programs (19) may access a file stored in the driver (22) database and only certain procedures within the selected applications (19) may be performed.

Feb. 8, 1965, No. 5384/65. Heading B3C. [Also in Division G3] In a control system for a drill, rotational speed is automatically increased and decreased with decrease and increase in measured torque load on the tool and feed rate is automatically increased and decreased with increase and decrease in rotational speed. In Fig. 8, a drill spindle is rotated by an electric motor 18 and the torque is maintained constant during drilling by a system (see Division G3) automatically controlling the speed of motor 18 in dependence on signals from electrical transducers 28 detecting twist, and hence torque, in a replaceable torsion bar 20 transmitting the drive. A disc 60 perforated with holes and controlling the light transmitted to a number of photocells, produces signals of different frequencies, one of which is selected by a push-button unit to control stepping motors 46A, 46B driving a lead screw 44 to feed the drill into the work at a speed related to the rotary speed of the drill. Should the drill become clogged or worn, undue decrease in speed due to the increase in torque is detected by a tachometer or the photo-cells to cause operation of an hydraulic ram 202 to withdraw the drill from the work, whereupon it speeds up and clears itself by centrifugal action. Motors 46A, 46B are also reversed for a short period so that when, immediately afterwards, the drill is reinserted, it is not initially forced to the bottom of the hole.

The defects may be manifest as pin holes or spots where the electrochromic transition is impaired. This is unacceptable for many applications such as electrochromic architectural glass. Improved electrochromic devices with low defectivity can be fabricated by depositing certain layered components of the electrochromic device in a single integrated deposition system. While these layers are being deposited and/or treated on a substrate, for example a glass window, the substrate never leaves a controlled ambient environment, for example a low pressure controlled atmosphere having very low levels of particles. These layers may be deposited using physical vapor deposition.",KAILASAM SRIDHAR;;FRIEDMAN ROBIN;;PRADHAN ANSHU;;ROZBICKI ROBERT T;;VIEW INC,KAILASAM SRIDHAR;;FRIEDMAN ROBIN;;PRADHAN ANSHU;;ROZBICKI ROBERT T,VIEW INC (2012-09-18),https://lens.org/067-379-602-230-218,Granted Patent,yes,101,5,75,468,0,C03C17/3417;;C23C10/28;;C23C14/08;;C23C14/18;;C23C14/56;;C23C14/58;;G02F1/15;;C23C14/083;;C23C14/085;;C23C14/185;;C23C14/568;;C23C14/5806;;C23C14/5853;;G02F1/1523;;C03C2217/94;;C03C17/3417;;C03C2217/94;;C23C10/28;;C23C14/083;;C23C14/085;;C23C14/185;;C23C14/568;;C23C14/5806;;C23C14/5853;;G02F1/1524;;C03C17/3417;;C03C2217/94;;C23C10/28;;C23C14/083;;C23C14/085;;C23C14/185;;C23C14/568;;C23C14/5806;;C23C14/5853;;G02F1/1524;;G02F1/1525;;G02F2001/1536;;C09K9/00;;C09K2211/183;;C09K2211/187;;B05D5/06;;B23K20/10;;C23C14/021;;C23C14/022;;C23C14/024;;C23C14/046;;C23C14/08;;C23C14/086;;C23C14/14;;C23C14/3407;;C23C14/58;;G02F1/1533;;G02F1/155;;G02F1/153,G02B26/00;;B05D5/06;;B23K20/10;;C03C17/34;;C23C10/28;;C23C14/02;;C23C14/04;;C23C14/08;;C23C14/14;;C23C14/18;;C23C14/34;;C23C14/56;;C23C14/58;;G02F1/03;;G02F1/133;;G02F1/1524;;G02F1/153;;G02F1/155;;G09G3/38,,82,8,058-541-100-352-852;;131-199-241-806-736;;089-383-192-598-14X;;120-625-670-904-721;;089-429-352-255-519;;173-680-154-478-804;;078-865-754-743-402;;103-630-942-831-483,10.2172/896321;;10.2172/840353;;10.2172/834778;;10.1016/s0040-6090(97)00796-7;;10.1007/bf02375835;;10.1063/1.88346;;10.1016/j.tsf.2004.12.022;;10.1143/jjap.22.152,"Exhibits A-F from SAGE Electrochromics, Inc.'s Invalidity Contentions Pursuant to Patent L.R. 3-3 and 3-4, in Sage Electrochromics, Inc. v.

The method is based on combining a preformed enzyme donor- (ED-) analyte conjugate/anti-analyte antibody complex with analyte present in the sample. The method comprises reacting a beta -galactosidase ED-analyte conjugate/anti-analyte antibody complex, a beta -galactosidase enzyme acceptor (EA), enzyme substrate and sample and determining the rate of enzyme-catalyzed reaction as indicative of the amount of analyte present in the sample. Usually, the EA is added to the reaction mixture after a time for the anti-analyte antibody of the complex to react with analyte present in the sample. In a particular embodiment, the method is used to determine the amount of digoxin in a serum sample. In another embodiment the method is used to determine the amount of T3 in a sample.

   Presented is a satellite communication system that allows aggregation of available transponder bandwidth. A channel signal is divided into subparts (e.g., data packets), formatted (e.g., encapsulated) and distributed among a plurality of subchannels according to bandwidth availability. Each subpart is encoded with information that facilitates proper reconstruction of the original channel data at the receiving station. The subchannels are transmitted to a receiving station, which synchronizes the subchannels and decapsulates the subparts. The receiving station includes a subchannel combiner which combines the decapsulated subparts in select subchannels to produce a reconstructed version of a user-selected channel signal. A controller in the receiving station identifies the subchannels to be combined in response to user selection and sends commands to a subchannel combiner. The receiving station also includes a connectivity matrix that discards the unnecessary subchannels before demodulation and reconstruction, reducing the number of demodulators in the system.

Based on the detected route, the method proceeds with determining the geographic route based on the host locations and then assigning a confidence level to the assigned location. A system collects the geographic information and allows web sites or other entities to request the geographic location of their visitors. The database of geographic locations may be stored in a central location or, alternatively, may be at least partially located at the web site. With this information, web sites can target content, advertising, or route traffic depending upon the geographic locations of their visitors. Through web site requests for geographic information, a central database tracks an Internet user's traffic on the Internet whereby a profile can be generated.

Based on the detected route, the method proceeds with determining the geographic route based on the host locations and then assigning a confidence level to the assigned location. A system collects the geographic information and allows web sites or other entities to request the geographic location of their visitors. The database of geographic locations may be stored in a central location or, alternatively, may be at least partially located at the web site.

The defects may be manifest as pin holes or spots where the electrochromic transition is impaired. This is unacceptable for many applications such as electrochromic architectural glass. Improved electrochromic devices with low defectivity can be fabricated by depositing certain layered components of the electrochromic device in a single integrated deposition system. While these layers are being deposited and/or treated on a substrate, for example a glass window, the substrate never leaves a controlled ambient environment, for example a low pressure controlled atmosphere having very low levels of particles. These layers may be deposited using physical vapor deposition.",VIEW INC,KAILASAM SRIDHAR KARTHIK;;FRIEDMAN ROBIN;;PRADHAN ANSHU A;;ROZBICKI ROBERT T,VIEW INC (2012-09-18),https://lens.org/091-196-446-571-114,Patent Application,yes,12,24,75,468,0,C03C17/3417;;C23C10/28;;C23C14/08;;C23C14/18;;C23C14/56;;C23C14/58;;G02F1/15;;C23C14/083;;C23C14/085;;C23C14/185;;C23C14/568;;C23C14/5806;;C23C14/5853;;G02F1/1523;;C03C2217/94;;C03C17/3417;;C03C2217/94;;C23C10/28;;C23C14/083;;C23C14/085;;C23C14/185;;C23C14/568;;C23C14/5806;;C23C14/5853;;G02F1/1524;;C03C17/3417;;C03C2217/94;;C23C10/28;;C23C14/083;;C23C14/085;;C23C14/185;;C23C14/568;;C23C14/5806;;C23C14/5853;;G02F1/1524;;G02F1/1525;;G02F2001/1536;;C09K9/00;;C09K2211/183;;C09K2211/187;;B05D5/06;;B23K20/10;;C23C14/021;;C23C14/022;;C23C14/024;;C23C14/046;;C23C14/08;;C23C14/086;;C23C14/14;;C23C14/3407;;C23C14/58;;G02F1/1533;;G02F1/155;;G02F1/153,B05D5/06;;B23K20/10;;C03C17/34;;C23C10/28;;C23C14/02;;C23C14/04;;C23C14/08;;C23C14/14;;C23C14/18;;C23C14/34;;C23C14/56;;C23C14/58;;G02F1/1524;;G02F1/153;;G02F1/155,,0,0,,,,PENDING

   Presented is a satellite communication system that allows aggregation of available transponder bandwidth. A channel signal is divided into subchannels if no full transponder is available to receive the channel signal in its entirety, and the subchannels are distributed among a available bandwidths in a plurality of transponders. At the receiving station, the subchannels are combined to form the original channel signal. The channel signal, whether divided and reconstructed or transmitted without being divided, are received into a switch matrix that receives a user channel selection and identifies the channel signal that corresponds to the selection. The identified channel signal is then demodulated and forwarded to a user interface unit. Only a single demodulator is necessary for a user interface unit.

A system and method for processing a cuff pressure waveform to determine the blood pressure of a patient. The processing unit of the NIBP monitoring system receives status signals from one or more physiological parameter monitors. The physiological parameter monitors each include an operating algorithm that causes the physiological parameter monitor to generate a status signal indicating whether artifacts are present that prevent the determination of the physiological parameter. When the processing unit receives the monitoring signal from the physiological parameter monitor indicating the presence of artifacts, the processing unit adjusts the operation of the NIBP monitor. The adjustment of the NIBP monitor may be to delay the beginning of the NIBP determination cycle until artifacts are no longer present from the physiological parameter monitor or to control the cuff pressure in such a manner as to keep the patient safe and comfortable until the artifacts are no longer present.",GEN ELECTRIC,LUCZYK WILLIAM J;;HERSH LAWRENCE T;;DONEHOO ROBERT F;;FRIEDMAN BRUCE A,,https://lens.org/023-378-291-502-691,Patent Application,no,8,1,2,2,0,A61B5/02255;;A61B5/02255;;A61B5/02225;;A61B5/02225;;A61B5/14542;;A61B5/14542;;A61B5/349;;A61B5/349;;A61B5/7203;;A61B5/7203;;A61B5/721;;A61B5/721;;A61B5/7221;;A61B5/7221,A61B5/022,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

In one embodiment, the ground station receives meteorological data ranging and internal temperature signals from the radiosonde. The data signals are read out as ambient conditions of the atmosphere and the range signal is phase-compared to a reference signal at periodic intervals. Changes in frequency due to temperature fluctuations in the radiosonde components are factored into the phase-comparison, and the resultant change in phase represents movement of the radiosonde. In another embodiment the range tone from a remote broadcast station is retransmitted by the radiosonde and received at the ground station simultaneously with the same tone directly from the broadcast station. The phase lag is measured and coupled with measurements of direction from the ground station to the radiosonde, and with the distance between the ground station and the broadcast station for determining the slant range.",VIZ MANUFACTURING COMPANY,FRIEDMAN MAURICE;;FISCHER ROBERT W;;ROSS MICHAEL D;;POTTS LUKEN W;;ROGERS GARY,VIZ MANUFACTURING COMPANY (1990-04-03);;SIPPICAN ACQUISTION CORP (2002-04-05);;SIPPICAN INC (2002-04-05),https://lens.org/021-703-197-160-123,Granted Patent,yes,6,9,1,2,0,G01S11/026;;G01W1/08;;G01S11/026,G01S11/02;;G01S19/14,340/870.1;;X 73170R;;342/118;;342/127,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION. 10 June, 1966, No. 25949/66. Headings H2F and H2J. A squirrel cage motor is energized from an A.C. source, the voltage of which is adjustable to control the torque and the frequency is controlled to correspond to the actual motor speed plus a constant value of slip. The motor is a three-phase machine for traction and the source comprises a thyristor inverter which is energized from a battery or fuel cell, with a voltage selector switch, or an engine driven alternator followed by a rectifier. For a star connected stator the inverter comprises two thyristors A1, A4 in each phase, which supply positive and negative half cycles respectively each of 120 degrees duration followed by 60 degrees of zero output, which is said to eliminate third and higher harmonics in the motor windings. Two further thyristors A3<SP>1</SP>, A6<SP>1</SP> shut the first two off by a commutating capacitor 57 and two more A6<SP>11</SP>, A3<SP>11</SP> allow reactive power to be returned to the supply, but these may be dispensed with if the main thyristors are switched over for regenerative braking. Alternatively, the commutating thyristors may be eliminated by using main thyristors of the type which can be turned off by a negative gate pulse, or by connecting the stator in delta so that current in one phase effects turn off in another. Triggering may be effected by a train of pulses from a transistor oscillator (e.g. at 10 kc/s.) via a saturable transformer having secondaries (one for each thyristor) switched by a photocell 53, the illumination of which is controlled by a revolving shutter 55 driven by a differential gear 48 which adds rotor speed to that of a D.C. motor 47 whose speed is adjustable to correspond to the required slip. In one alternative arrangement the summation is made in a transformer device (Fig. 8, not shown) having stationary windings energized from a slip frequency generator and secondaries rotated by the rotor shaft, the sum being induced in a stationary pick-up winding. In another arrangement (Figs. 9, 10, 11, not shown) the output of an A.C. tachogenerator is rectified and smoothed to produce an actual speed voltage to which is added a voltage for the desired slip, and this sum controls the frequency of an oscillator which actuates ring counters (one per phase) which supply the triggering pulses. In Fig. 12 (not shown) the shaft driven alternator is replaced by a toothed wheel magnetic impulse generator.",GEN MOTORS CORP,AGARWAL PAUL DHARAM;;COLTEN ROBERT BELSON;;FRIEDMAN DONALD;;JOHNSTON RICHARD WRAY;;WERTH JOHN JOSEPH,,https://lens.org/056-777-076-611-380,Granted Patent,no,0,6,1,1,0,B60L50/51;;B60L50/13;;Y02T10/70,B60L11/18;;B60L50/13,H2F FDACS         FDACS;;H2F FDAXS         FDAXS;;H2F FSDA          FSDA;;H2F FSF           F9B2;;H2F F12           -;;H2F F15           -;;H2F F9B2          -;;H2F F9F1          FSDA;;H2F F9F5          FSDA;;H2F F9H3          -;;H2F F9J18         FSDA;;H2F F9N1B3        -;;H2F F9N2A         FSDA;;H2F F9N4B         FSDA;;H2F F9P1          FSDA;;H2F F9Q           FSDA;;H2F F9R26B        FSDA;;H2F F9R32C        FSDA;;H2F F9R39C        FSDA;;H2F F9R39C        F9B2;;H2F F9R8C         FSDA;;H2F F9T2          FSDA;;H2F F9T4A         -;;H2J JCA           JCA;;H2J JSVP          JSVP;;H2J J1D2          -;;H2J J1H1          -;;H2J J1J           -;;H2J J1N1          -;;H2J J1X           -;;H2J J12N1         J1N1;;H2J J12N3A        J1N1;;H2J J12N3B        J1N1;;H2J J12N3Y        J1N1,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
