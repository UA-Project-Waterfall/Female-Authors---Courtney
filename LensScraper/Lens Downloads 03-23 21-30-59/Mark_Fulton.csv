To avoid interfering with fishing tool operations and to avoid damaging the locking nut of the socket assembly at these times, the locking nut is placed well below the wickers of the swivel or mandrel and is enlarged in diameter sufficiently to pass over the swivel when it is desired to use the swivel alone.

First main part comprises a pair of backward supports for engagement with the rear femoral condyles. Second main part comprises positioning holes to receive fixing pins, by means of which the cutting unit can be attached to the resected distal surface of the femur. First main part is detachably attachable to second main part in several separate positions for inclination of second main part relative anatomical singularity of patient, when supports of first main part are engaged with rear condyles. Guide additionally comprises a curved slot and an engaging element. Engagement element is engaged with the attachment slot with possibility of disconnection of the first main part to the second main part, and the engagement member enters the corresponding position along the slot in each of said plurality of separate positions when the first base portion is attached to the second main portion. Surgical kit for knee replacement surgery comprises said guide and one or more additional first major parts of a different type. Each additional first main part is made with possibility of attachment with possibility of disconnection to second main part in several separate positions for inclination of second main part of guide under other angles relative to anatomical features of patient, when supports of this first main part are in engagement with posterior condyles of femur. Method for arrangement of cutting unit on resected distal surface of femur of patient during operation of knee joint replacement involves stages, on which guide is provided, comprising a first main part having a pair of backward extending supports, a second main part comprising positioning holes, wherein the first main portion is detachably attachable to the second body portion in a plurality of separate positions for inclining the second body portion relative to the at least one anatomical feature of the patient, and a curved cutout and an engagement member configured to be placed in a corresponding position along the slot in each of said plurality of separate positions, when first main part is attached to second main part. Further, the first main part is detachably connected to the second main part in one of said several separate positions, as a result of which the engagement element is engaged with the slot and is located in one of the specified corresponding positions along the slot. First main portion is located above the resected distal surface of the femoral bone so that the pair of backward supports of the first main portion is engaged with the posterior condyles of the femoral bone, and so that second main portion is located above resected distal surface of femur. Fixing pins are inserted through positioning holes and in resected distal surface of femur. Guide is removed from a femoral bone and a cutting block is placed on a femoral bone using fixing pins.EFFECT: inventions provide determining proper places on bones, in which an incision for implantation of implanted components is to be performed.24 cl, 14 dwg",DEPUY IRELAND ULTD CO,FULTON MARK;;REEVE MICHAEL,,https://lens.org/073-465-060-240-240,Granted Patent,no,6,0,15,15,0,A61B17/155;;A61F2/4657;;A61B17/155;;A61B17/155;;A61B17/1764;;A61B17/1764;;A61B90/06;;A61B2090/061;;A61B2090/061;;A61B2090/067;;A61B2090/067;;A61F2/4657,A61B17/15;;A61F2/38;;A61F2/46,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

   There is provided a method of, computer programs for and apparatus for providing and accessing digital content such as a news item. A news provider generates a news item, creates a digitally signed version of the news item and packages them together with a digital certificate issued by a certificate authority containing the public key required to decrypt the digitally signed version. The package is posted to a server and is transmitted, or made available or transmission, over a public data network together with a computer program for verifying the news item. A receiving party receives, over the public data network, the package at a client device and is provided with means for launching, and if necessary first downloading, the verifying program. The verifying program uses the public key contained in the certificate to verify the digitally signed news item. Before being first used to verify a news item, the verifying program receives a shared secret from the receiving party which is stored locally to the client device and is used by the verifying program to confirm that it performed the verification process.
