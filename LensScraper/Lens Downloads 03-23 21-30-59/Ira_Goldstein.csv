The purpose of the algorithm is to influence the user's behavior so that the measured parameters return to the desired normal range. The algorithm accomplishes this in the following innovative fashion: first, it employs a non-deterministic decision making procedure to select the method of communication. The purpose is to preserve an element of surprise and keep the user interested in the message being delivered. Second, the algorithm varies the emphasis of the message and the time of transmission again to avoid a monotonous sequence of communications.

    In one embodiment a hand operated machine for making curly ribbon products comprises a rotary drum that includes a station to attach the uncurled ribbons (more than one), a cutting station to cut the curled ribbons, and a stapling station to staple the ribbons together or to a card, ribbon, or the like. A handle is provided to rotate the drum and a fixed curling mechanism mounted downstream of the drum serves to curl the ribbon as the drum rotates to place the ribbon in contact with the curling mechanism. In another embodiment the machine is automated and includes a drum that has the same stations. The attaching station includes a pair of jaws that are sequentially movable one relative to the other and together to attain attaching the ribbons to the drum for the first cycle, detaching the ribbon during the first cycle and attaching the succeeding ribbon used in the next cycle for mass producing the curly ribbon product. The stapling and cutting are automatic and the card feeding machine is movable relative to the drum to avoid snarling the ribbon when released. The curling mechanism is adjustable to change the exit angle to select the desired curl characteristics of the curled ribbon.
