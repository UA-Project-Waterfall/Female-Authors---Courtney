The device for providing access to the surgical location includes an elongate body that includes an outer tube and an inner tube. The inner tube is moveably received (e.g., via a worm drive) within the outer tube. Accordingly, the inner tube is selectively extensible and retractable relative to the outer tube in a telescopic manner. The extension and retraction capabilities of the device facilitate proper placement of the device within the surgical location. In addition, both the inner tube and the outer tube include inner surfaces. These inner surfaces define a passage extending through the elongate body. In operation, the passage allows for inserting surgical instruments through the device into the surgical location.",GFT TECHNOLOGIES,FEIGENBAUM FRANK;;TAY BOBBY;;GRIFFITT WESLEY,GFT TECHNOLOGIES (2007-09-10),https://lens.org/059-910-880-520-817,Patent Application,yes,2,59,1,1,0,A61B1/3135;;A61B17/3423;;A61B17/7074;;A61B2017/00991;;A61B2017/3443;;A61B17/3423;;A61B2017/00991;;A61B2017/3443;;A61B1/3135;;A61B17/7074,A61B1/32,600/204,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
