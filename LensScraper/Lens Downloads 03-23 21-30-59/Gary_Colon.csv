According to one aspect of the invention, a method for repairing shorts between metallic conductors located within in a glass ceramic product, such as an electronic substrate, comprises the steps of (a) pre-conditioning the glass to resist cracking from the generation of heat by any shorts melt down current subsequently applied to said conductors; and (b) subsequently applying a melt down current to said conductors to repair any short located therebetween. The aforestated method minimizes the potential for glass damage resulting from defect repair activity and optimizes defect repair yield. Further aspects of the invention relate to processes that involve preconditioning conductors located within glass ceramic products to assure that molten metal from a short melt down juncture draws back toward parent conductor lines, and processes that are used to effectively control the thermal gradient in the areas within glass ceramic products where shorts repair activity is to take place.",IBM,COLON JOSE L;;HORCHOS LEONARD A;;SUBACK GARY P,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (1991-12-23),https://lens.org/030-046-126-416-776,Granted Patent,yes,9,132,1,1,0,H05B6/101;;H05K1/0306;;H05K3/225;;H05K2203/101;;H05K2203/1115;;H05K2203/175;;Y10T29/49004;;Y10T29/49004;;H05B6/101;;H05K1/0306;;H05K3/225;;H05K2203/101;;H05K2203/1115;;H05K2203/175,H05B6/10;;H05K1/03;;H05K3/22,219/770;;219/779;;437/170;;29/593,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
