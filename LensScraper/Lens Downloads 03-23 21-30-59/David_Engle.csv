The dispensing system has a microprocessor-based control system and progressive cavity pumps which provide a very accurate control of component ratios, shot sizes, flow rates and dispense durations. The system has numerous feedback components for accurately controlling the pressure, flow rates, fluid levels and amounts of fluids dispensed. Where a valved nozzle is used, the pressure in the flow system is used to control the pumps rather than the valve. Such a system may be used as a sprayer with compressed air added. Drum rams are associated with the supply drums and the progressive cavity pumps may be placed on the drum ram. Maintenance of a steady state in the system is accomplished with back and forth movement of the pump, with compensation for pressure changes. Absolute rotational position of the pump can be monitored when a set pressure is maintained, to diagnose system conditions. A high flow system uses ball valves and a releasably coupled manifold. A mold charging system uses pressure to control the pumps which are cycled on and off to avoid overpressurizing the mold. The rate of pressure increase is used to control the rate of flow from the pumps as the mold approaches completion of the charge, again to avoid overpressurizing the mold. A signal controlled by a timer can indicate elapsed time as a warning that material within the mixer conduit is hardening to a condition such that flow cannot be reinitiated.",FLUID RES CORP,CLINE DAVID;;CLARK TIMOTHY;;GORDON STEPHEN;;ENGLE MICHAEL,,https://lens.org/111-964-904-833-138,Granted Patent,no,0,1,16,16,0,B05B12/1418;;G05D16/2066;;B29B7/726;;B29B7/728;;B29B7/748;;B05B7/32;;B29B7/94;;B29B7/603;;B29B7/325;;B29B7/748;;B05B12/1418;;G05D16/2066;;B29B7/726;;B29B7/728;;B05B7/32;;B29B7/94,B05B7/32;;B05B12/14;;G05D16/20;;G05D27/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A nozzle that is defined by a bore in the co-extrusion die extends about a nozzle axis to a nozzle exit of the co-extrusion die. An injector extends through the bore of the co-extrusion die along the nozzle axis. The injector and nozzle together form a dough into a rope that is tubular with a wall portion and an inner cavity surrounded by the wall portion as the dough is extruded out of the nozzle exit and about the injector. A compressed gas source provides a compressed gas out of an injector outlet and into the inner cavity of the rope to radially stretch the wall portion of the rope as the rope is dispersed from the injector. The co-extrusion die is spaced from the extruder to define a void therebetween. A delivery system delivers an entrainable material to the compressed gas in a pipe. The pipe is connected to an injector inlet of the injector in the void. This allows the pipe to operate within the ambient temperature of the environment and for the entrainable material to be entrained into the compressed gas prior to being introduced into the injector.,GIMMLER NORBERT;;ALMEIDA DOMINGUEZ HELBERT DAVID;;BERNATH CHARLES;;SMITH CHARLES A;;ENGLE TERRY;;ENGLE PENNY,GIMMLER NORBERT;;ALMEIDA DOMINGUEZ HELBERT DAVID;;BERNATH CHARLES;;SMITH CHARLES A;;ENGLE TERRY;;ENGLE PENNY,KELLOGG COMPANY (2011-06-14),https://lens.org/031-197-813-831-618,Patent Application,yes,18,8,2,2,0,A21C11/163;;A23P30/25;;B29C48/18;;B29C48/04;;B29C48/09;;B29C48/345;;B29C48/17;;B29C48/87;;B29C48/18;;B29C48/04;;B29C48/09;;B29C48/345;;B29C48/17;;B29C48/87;;A21C11/163;;A23P30/25,B29C48/09;;B29C48/345,425/131.1,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

    A training system includes software installable on an instructor's computer for configuring a plurality of workstations networked thereto. The software is adapted to copy and install an indicated training module including a particular instruction functionality onto a selected student workstation. Once all the workstations are configured as desired, the instructor can invoke additional components of the system, including initiating a running of a training scenario from the instructor's computer on selected workstations. The training scenario includes input provided to the training module, to which a trainee responds, and the instructor can assess the response. A particular embodiment of the invention is for use in an environment wherein coordinated effort by a plurality of workers is required. Such environments may include, but are not intended to be limited to, a command center of a military location.

    A system for metering and dispensing single and plural component liquids and solids as described herein. The dispensing system has a microprocessor-based control system and progressive cavity pumps which provide a very accurate control of component ratios, shot sizes, flow rates and dispense durations. The system has numerous feedback components for accurately controlling the pressure, flow rates, fluid levels and amounts of fluids dispensed. Where a valved nozzle is used, the pressure in the flow system is used to control the pumps rather than the valve. Such a system may be used as a sprayer with compressed air added. Drum rams are associated with the supply drums and the progressive cavity pumps may be placed on the drum ram. Maintenance of a steady state in the system is accomplished with back and forth movement of the pump, with compensation for pressure changes. Absolute rotational position of the pump can be monitored when a set pressure is maintained, to diagnose system conditions. A high flow system uses ball valves and a releasably coupled manifold. A mold charging system uses pressure to control the pumps which are cycled on and off to avoid overpressurizing the mold. The rate of pressure increase is used to control the rate of flow from the pumps as the mold approaches completion of the charge, again to avoid overpressurizing the mold. A signal controlled by a timer can indicate elapsed time as a warning that material within the mixer conduit is hardening to a condition such that flow cannot be reinitiated.

A latch (84) is pivotly mounted on the outside of the quill and has a tab (92) which extends into the quill. The tab latches on to a rim of the mixer shaft when the shaft is inserted into the quill. The latch is held by a spring (97) suitably provided by a expansible lock ring so as to enable the latch to pivot as a lever about a fulcrum. The shaft is locked in the quill by a manually actuable connector (120) (suitably a set screw) which is disposed in alignment with the latch in order to align the quill with an opening for a tool which is manually actuable to lock the shaft in place with the set screw. An indicator surface (96) is provided on the latch facing an indicator (100) which is mounted in the housing.

The dispensing system has a microprocessor-based control system and progressive cavity pumps which provide a very accurate control of component ratios, shot sizes, flow rates and dispense durations. The system has numerous feedback components for accurately controlling the pressure, flow rates, fluid levels and amounts of fluids dispensed. Where a valved nozzle is used, the pressure in the flow system is used to control the pumps rather than the valve. Such a system may be used as a sprayer with compressed air added. Drum rams are associated with the supply drums and the progressive cavity pumps may be placed on the drum ram. Maintenance of a steady state in the system is accomplished with back and forth movement of the pump, with compensation for pressure changes. Absolute rotational position of the pump can be monitored when a set pressure is maintained, to diagnose system conditions. A high flow system uses ball valves and a releasably coupled manifold. A mold charging system uses pressure to control the pumps which are cycled on and off to avoid overpressurizing the mold. The rate of pressure increase is used to control the rate of flow from the pumps as the mold approaches completion of the charge, again to avoid overpressurizing the mold. A signal controlled by a timer can indicate elapsed time as a warning that material within the mixer conduit is hardening to a condition such that flow cannot be reinitiated.",FLUID RES CORP,CLINE DAVID J;;CLARK TIMOTHY S;;GORDON STEPHEN P;;ENGLE MICHAEL R,,https://lens.org/053-047-517-781-93X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,16,16,0,B05B12/1418;;G05D16/2066;;B29B7/726;;B29B7/728;;B29B7/748;;B05B7/32;;B29B7/94;;B29B7/603;;B29B7/325;;B29B7/748;;B05B12/1418;;G05D16/2066;;B29B7/726;;B29B7/728;;B05B7/32;;B29B7/94,B67B7/00;;B05B7/32;;B05B12/14;;G05D16/20;;G05D27/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
