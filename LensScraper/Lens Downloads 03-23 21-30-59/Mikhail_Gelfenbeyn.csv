An example method includes receiving a message from a user of a client-side computing device; retrieving, from a graph, information concerning relationships between the AI character model and the user; generating, based on the message and the information concerning relationships, an action associated with AI character model; and causing the AI character model to perform the action in a virtual environment provided to the user via the client-side computing device. The client-side computing device may be in communication with a computing platform. The graph may include a first node associated with the AI character model, a second node associated with the user, and an edge between the first node and the second node. The edge may be associated with the information concerning relationships between the AI character model and the user.",THEAI INC,GELFENBEYN ILYA;;ERMOLENKO MIKHAIL;;GIBBS KYLAN,THEAI INC (2023-04-25),https://lens.org/054-642-265-365-392,Patent Application,yes,4,0,2,2,0,G06N3/006;;G06N3/045;;G06N3/08;;G06N5/01;;A63F13/55;;G06T13/40;;G06F40/30;;G06N20/00;;G06N3/006,G06N3/006,,0,0,,,,PENDING
