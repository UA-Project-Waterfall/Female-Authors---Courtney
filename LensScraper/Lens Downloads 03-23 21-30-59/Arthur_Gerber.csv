The medium can be formed from a single transparent thermoplastic substrate with an array of indentations in a first surface. The bottom of each indentation is coated with a reflective material. When viewed from the opposite surface of the substrate, the indentations become mesas. Recording is by exposure to a laser beam that reduces the reflectivity of selected mirrors. After exposure to the recording laser beam, the mirrors retain enough reflectivity to be distinguishable from the intervening valleys. The mirrors serve as timing and tracking markers prior to and during recording, and during read-out. The area and location of each information bit is determined prior to recording: not as a result of the recording process. The mirrors are scanned diagonally across the rows that make up the array.

The polyphenolic products are prepared by heating glyoxal at a temperature of about 80.degree. C. to about 100.degree. C. with a molar excess of a phenol in the presence of an acidic catalyst which is eliminated from the reaction mixture at a temperature below about 170.degree. C. The total mole ratio of glyoxal to phenol charged to the reaction mixture is about 0.15 to 0.22 moles of glyoxal for each mole of phenol. The glyoxal is added continuously or by stepwise additions to the phenol so as to keep the aldehyde units in the reaction mixture to less than about 70% of the aldehyde units in the total quantity of glyoxal to be charged for making the polyphenol. Water is distilled stepwise or continuously from the reaction mixture. The catalyst is removed from the reaction mixture by further distilling the reaction mixture, generally at higher temperatures. After removal of the catalyst, unreacted phenol is removed by distillation and the reaction mixture is heated at a temperature of about 175.degree. C. to 200.degree. C. for about 0.25 hours to about 3 hours to produce a polyphenolic reaction product having high fluorescence, high UV absorbance and high solubility in organic solvents.

The polyphenolic products are prepared by heating glyoxal at a temperature of about 80 DEG C. to about 100 DEG C. with a molar excess of a phenol in the presence of an acidic catalyst which is eliminated from the reaction mixture at a temperature below about 170 DEG C. The total mole ratio of glyoxal to phenol charged to the reaction mixture is about 0.15 to 0.22 moles of glyoxal for each mole of phenol. The glyoxal is added continuously or by stepwise additions to the phenol so as to keep the aldehyde units in the reaction mixture to less than about 70% of the aldehyde units in the total quantity of glyoxal to be charged for making the polyphenol. Water is distilled stepwise or continuously from the reaction mixture. The catalyst is removed from the reaction mixture by further distilling the reaction mixture, generally at higher temperatures. After removal of the catalyst, unreacted phenol is removed by distillation and the reaction mixture is heated at a temperature of about 175 DEG C. to 200 DEG C. for about 0.25 hours to about 3 hours to produce a polyphenolic reaction product having high fluorescence, high UV absorbance and high solubility in organic solvents.

The parallel rows of the mirrors are the same distance apart as the mirrors in each row. A layer of transparent plastic over the mirrors provides dust protection. The medium can be formed from a single transparent thermoplastic substrate with an array of indentations in a first surface. The bottom of each indentation is coated with a reflective material. When viewed from the opposite surface of the substrate, the indentations become mesas. Recording is by exposure to a laser beam that reduces the reflectivity of selected mirrors. After exposure to the recording laser beam, the mirrors retain enough reflectivity to be distinguishable from the intervening valleys. The mirrors serve as timing and tracking markers prior to and during recording, and during read-out. The area and location of each information bit is determined prior to recording: not as a result of the recording process. The mirrors are scanned diagonally across the rows that make up the array. Scanning is accomplished by reciprocating movement of the medium.","GERBER, ARTHUR M.","GERBER, ARTHUR M.",,https://lens.org/124-341-686-049-046,Search Report,yes,3,0,4,9,0,G11B7/26;;G11B7/00455;;G11B7/0904;;G11B7/24;;G11B7/24085,G11B7/00;;G11B7/0045;;G11B7/007;;G11B7/013;;G11B7/09;;G11B7/24;;G11B7/26,,1,0,,,"IBM TECHNICAL DISCLOSURE BULLETIN, vol. 25, no. 11A, April 1983, pages 5523-5524, New York, US; R.F.

Water is distilled stepwise or continuously from the reaction mixture. The catalyst is removed from the reaction mixture by further distilling the reaction mixture, generally at higher temperatures. After removal of the catalyst, unreacted phenol is removed by distillation and the reaction mixture is heated at a temperature of about 175 DEG C. to 200 DEG C. for about 0.25 hours to about 3 hours to produce a polyphenolic reaction product having high fluorescence, high UV absorbance and high solubility in organic solvents.

The parallel rows of the mirrors are the same distance apart as the mirrors in each row. A layer of transparent plastic over the mirrors provides dust protection. The medium can be formed from a single transparent thermoplastic substrate with an array of indentations in a first surface. The bottom of each indentation is coated with a reflective material. When viewed from the opposite surface of the substrate, the indentations become mesas. Recording is by exposure to a laser beam that reduces the reflectivity of selected mirrors. After exposure to the recording laser beam, the mirrors retain enough reflectivity to be distinguishable from the intervening valleys. The mirrors serve as timing and tracking markers prior to and during recording, and during read-out. The area and location of each information bit is determined prior to recording: not as a result of the recording process. The mirrors are scanned diagonally across the rows that make up the array.

Pre-solvolysis with small quantities of water, alkanols of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or alkylene glycols of 2 to 4 carbon atoms improve compatibility of trisubstituted phosphites with the resin. Pre-hydrolysis of the phosphites as well as addition of furfuryl alcohol or alkylene glycols of 2 to 4 carbon atoms accelerate the hardening (curing) of the resin. Various compounds such as: carboxylic acid amides, urea, dicyandiamide, N-methylolated amides, N-alkyl 2-pyrrolidinones having 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, those having an internal epoxide group, alkanols, and Schiff bases retard the ambient temperature hardening of the resin with the aryl phosphite hardening agents.",BORDEN INC,GERBER ARTHUR H,MOMENTIVE SPECIALTY CHEMICALS INC (1996-06-11);;BORDEN CHEMICAL INC.

The polyphenolic products are prepared by heating glyoxal at a temperature of about 80 DEG C. to about 100 DEG C. with a molar excess of a phenol in the presence of an acidic catalyst which is eliminated from the reaction mixture at a temperature below about 170 DEG C. The total mole ratio of glyoxal to phenol charged to the reaction mixture is about 0.15 to 0.22 moles of glyoxal for each mole of phenol. The glyoxal is added continuously or by stepwise additions to the phenol so as to keep the aldehyde units in the reaction mixture to less than about 70% of the aldehyde units in the total quantity of glyoxal to be charged for making the polyphenol. Water is distilled stepwise or continuously from the reaction mixture. The catalyst is removed from the reaction mixture by further distilling the reaction mixture, generally at higher temperatures. After removal of the catalyst, unreacted phenol is removed by distillation and the reaction mixture is heated at a temperature of about 175 DEG C. to 200 DEG C. for about 0.25 hours to about 3 hours to produce a polyphenolic reaction product having high fluorescence, high UV absorbance and high solubility in organic solvents.

The medium can be formed from a single transparent thermoplastic substrate with an array of indentations in a first surface. The bottom of each indentation is coated with a reflective material. When viewed from the opposite surface of the substrate, the indentations become mesas. Recording is by exposure to a laser beam that reduces the reflectivity of selected mirrors. After exposure to the recording laser beam, the mirrors retain enough reflectivity to be distinguishable from the intervening valleys. The mirrors serve as timing and tracking markers prior to and during recording, and during read-out. The area and location of each information bit is determined prior to recording: not as a result of the recording process. The mirrors are scanned diagonally across the rows that make up the array.

The polyphenolic products are prepared by heating glyoxal at a temperature of about 80.degree. C. to about 100.degree. C. with a molar excess of a phenol in the presence of an acidic catalyst which is eliminated from the reaction mixture at a temperature below about 170.degree. C. The total mole ratio of glyoxal to phenol charged to the reaction mixture is about 0.15 to 0.22 moles of glyoxal for each mole of phenol. The glyoxal is added continuously or by stepwise additions to the phenol so as to keep the aldehyde units in the reaction mixture to less than about 70% of the aldehyde units in the total quantity of glyoxal to be charged for making the polyphenol. Water is distilled stepwise or continuously from the reaction mixture. The catalyst is removed from the reaction mixture by further distilling the reaction mixture, generally at higher temperatures. After removal of the catalyst, unreacted phenol is removed by distillation and the reaction mixture is heated at a temperature of about 175.degree. C. to 200.degree.

A layer of transparent plastic over the mirrors provides dust protection. The medium can be formed also from a single transparent thermoplastic substrate with an array of indentations in a first surface. The bottom of each indentation is coated with a reflective material. When viewed from the opposite surface of the substrate, the indentations become mesas. The micromirrors are formed of a composite of gold and silicon dioxide. Recording is by exposure to a laser beam that reduces the reflectivity of selected mirrors. After exposure to the recording laser beam, the mirrors retain enough reflectivity to be distinguishable from the intervening valleys. The mirrors serve as timing and tracking markers prior to and during recording, and during read-out. The area and location of each information bit is determined prior to recording: not as a result of the recording process.

The total mole ratio of glyoxal to phenol charged to the reaction mixture is about 0.15 to 0.22 moles of glyoxal for each mole of phenol. The glyoxal is added continuously or by stepwise additions to the phenol so as to keep the aldehyde units in the reaction mixture to less than about 70% of the aldehyde units in the total quantity of glyoxal to be charged for making the polyphenol. Water is distilled stepwise or continuously from the reaction mixture. The catalyst is removed from the reaction mixture by further distilling the reaction mixture, generally at higher temperatures. After removal of the catalyst, unreacted phenol is removed by distillation and the reaction mixture is heated at a temperature of about 175 DEG C. to 200 DEG C. for about 0.25 hours to about 3 hours to produce a polyphenolic reaction product having high fluorescence, high UV absorbance and high solubility in organic solvents.

The phenolic resin compositions of this invention comprise an esterified phenolic compound and a base and optionally an unesterified phenolic resole resin. The composition cures in the presence of water or other polar solvent. The esterified phenolic compound contains at least one phenolic hydroxyl group or an esterified phenolic hydroxyl group and further contains at least one esterified methylol group positioned ortho or para to a phenolic hydroxyl group or an esterified phenolic group. The compounds find particular use in bonding refractory materials, such as sand, in the production of foundry moulds and cores and in treating subterranean formations. These composition have the advantage that cure can be obtained at room temperature without the use of strong alkali.
