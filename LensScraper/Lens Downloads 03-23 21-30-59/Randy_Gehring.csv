A first mating member is attached to the first and engages a first connecting member of a holding tank drain. A second mating member is attached to the second end and engages a drainage conduit. A cap is removably coupled to the second end of the tube. An air inlet is mounted on the cap and is fluidly coupled to the tube. A closure is mounted on the tube and is positioned in a first position preventing fluid movement through the tube or in a second position allowing fluid movement through the tube. Air is injected into the tube through the air inlet such that the air removes material trapped in the holding tank drain to increase flow from the holding tank through the holding tank drain.",GEHRING RANDY,GEHRING RANDY,GEHRING TODD (2023-10-30),https://lens.org/064-653-080-672-739,Granted Patent,yes,12,2,1,1,0,E03F1/008;;E03F9/00;;B60R15/00;;E03C1/304;;B60R15/00;;E03F9/00;;E03F1/008,E03D9/00;;B60P3/32;;B60R15/00;;E03C1/304,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
