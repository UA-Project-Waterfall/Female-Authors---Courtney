To efficiently allocate power, a highly programmable backup power system is desired. The present invention discloses a redundant power supply unit that provides backup power to network devices. The redundant power supply unit will supply power to the network devices in the case that their local internal power supplies fail. Furthermore, if there is a power outage from the utility company, the redundant power supply will supply power to the network devices from a internal battery pack. When the internal battery pack is engaged, the redundant power supply uses programmed control logic that controls how the power from internal battery pack will be allocated. Specifically, since the power from the batteries is limited, it can be used to power some network devices for a certain amount of time and other network devices for a longer amount of time. Furthermore, the power from the batteries can be allocated depending on the voltage level of the battery thus, when the battery voltage drops below a certain threshold the power supply may disconnect power to some units and maintain power to others.",BAY NETWORKS INC,EDWARDS MICHAEL S,BENHOV GMBH LLC (2015-08-11);;NORTEL NETWORKS NA INC (1999-04-30);;POPKIN FAMILY ASSETS L.L.C (2007-04-27);;INNOVATION MANAGEMENT SCIENCES LLC (2007-04-24);;NORTEL NETWORKS LIMITED (2000-08-30),https://lens.org/196-828-094-717-609,Granted Patent,yes,12,110,1,1,0,G06F1/263;;G06F1/30;;H02J1/14;;H02J3/38;;H02J9/06;;H02J1/14;;H02J9/06;;G06F1/30;;G06F1/263;;H02J3/38,G06F1/26;;G06F1/30;;H02J1/14;;H02J3/14;;H02J3/38;;H02J9/06,364/492;;364/481;;364/483;;307/23;;307/29;;307/43;;323/284;;395/750.01,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

To adjust for undesirable room acoustics, high frequency slope compensation is provided which reaches its plateau well beyond the highest audible frequency, providing a more accurate audio reproduction. Electronic filtering increases the high frequency components beyond the audible range, to drive a single set of high frequency acoustical drivers to properly compensate for high frequency attenuation due to room acoustics. Alternatively, a dedicated high frequency acoustical driver provides the high frequency emphasis to compensate for room acoustics, with another set of high frequency acoustical drivers accurately reproducing the audio signal. A multi-compound Isobarik system is also taught, one embodiment utilizing a single internal baffle within a loudspeaker enclosure to allow acoustical drivers operating within similar frequency ranges to be physically located anywhere within the enclosure without limitation due to internal air pressure variations. Acoustical drivers of similar frequency ranges may be physically located at opposite ends of the loudspeaker system enclosure, making the speaker system less sensitive to room acoustics. Enclosure resonance significantly reduced by the use of cylindrical prisms as inexpensive structural elements. In one embodiment, a loudspeaker enclosure is formed of a plurality of subenclosures, allowing a loudspeaker system to be constructed of a plurality of simple elements. In one embodiment, each subenclosure has similar characteristics and is suitable as a loudspeaker system. Alternatively, various subenclosure types have different characteristics so various subenclosures of various characteristics are assembled to form a loudspeaker system of desired acoustical characteristics.",CASS AUDIO INC,EDWARDS MICHAEL S,EDWARDS MICHAEL S (1996-11-22);;CASS AUDIO INCORPORATED (1993-04-05),https://lens.org/168-101-942-237-243,Granted Patent,yes,0,45,1,1,0,H04R3/12;;H04R3/12;;H04R1/24;;H04R1/24,H04R3/12,381/90;;381/88;;381/89;;381/188;;181/145;;181/147,1,0,,,"Audio Cyclopedia , Howard M.

The secondary energy impulse propagates to the formations more slowly than the primary seismic waves from the same activation of the energy source travelling at the speed of sound as attenuated by the materials through which they pass.

Road traffic detectors. PLESSEY CO. Ltd. 16 July, 1969 [18 July, 1968], No. 34240/68. Heading G4Q. A road traffic detection system comprises a number of detector circuits, each one being as shown in the drawing but operating at different frequencies from each other to avoid unwanted signals due to coupling between the inductive detector loops 3. Each circuit comprises an oscillator 1 coupled to a buried cable detector loop 3 tuned to the oscillator frequency. The passage of a vehicle over the loop alters its impedance to produce an output from a phase discriminator 4 which is amplified at 7 to operate a relay 8. To avoid unwanted signals at the outputs of the amplifiers 7, the difference between the operating frequencies of any two of the oscillators 1 is arranged to be outside the frequency response range of the amplifiers. As described, this frequency difference is arranged to be above the upper limit of the response range.",PLESSEY CO LTD,EDWARDS JOHN;;WHITTINGHAM MICHAEL LAURENCE,,https://lens.org/165-160-927-604-827,Granted Patent,no,0,3,3,3,0,G08G1/042,G08G1/042,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The pouch is disposed within a flexible water-protective bag, and the bag is then given an outer holder, commonly of corrugated board or the like, to provide additional strength and some protection against the likely ambient conditions. Such a triple-layer package is easy and safe to use, but has some disadvantages, namely that the present outer holder does not seem to hold the bag properly, so that if the bag-disposed pouch becomes brittle it is too easily susceptible to damage from mechanical shock. The present invention proposes a solution to this, in which the pouch/bag combination is given an outer holder of a novel form which provides significantly enhanced protection against shock. More specifically the invention suggests the use, as the outer portion of the three-layer package, of a pillow-shaped open-ended sleeve-like holder made from a suitably-shaped and -cut blank (1) that has been folded in such a way as to grip the bag securely and also preferably to provide the holder with cuff-like strengthening and shock-absorbing members (24, 26) around the two end edges of the sleeve. The sleeve is kept closed by a closure flap (18) the corners (20) of which are conveniently inserted into the space between the cuff members (24, 26) and part of the sleeve body (4).",AMCOR PACKAGING UK LTD;;AQUASOL LTD;;PARKES MICHAEL;;EDWARDS DAVID BRIAN,PARKES MICHAEL;;EDWARDS DAVID BRIAN,,https://lens.org/085-180-310-526-468,Patent Application,yes,5,7,5,5,0,B65D81/03;;B65D5/0209;;B65D65/46,B65D5/02;;B65D65/46;;B65D81/03,,0,0,,,,PENDING

This provides a better image in all types of weather and visibility conditions. In addition, the camera system includes dynamic range transform logic (26), (28) and (30), which selectively compresses the dynamic range of the respective pixel values comprising the image to extract the most useful information from the extended dynamic range of the image. This reduces the amount of information required to be processed while retaining a quality image.

New queries are processed into component expressions, and each expression is checked to see if the expression was previously processed and stored as a processed expression. If so, the operand list and list of binary characters for the previously-stored expression may be used in processing the current expression. If there is no previously-stored expression that corresponds to the current expression, the previously-stored expressions are checked to see if any correspond to a complement of the current expression. If so, a new expression is easily constructed for the current expression by retrieving the list of binary characters that correspond to the complement expression, and inverting the bits in the list of binary characters. If there is no previously-stored expression that corresponds to the current expression or its complement, an operand list and corresponding list of binary characters are generated for the current expression.

This results in the cis-1,4-polybutadiene exhibiting good processability without sacrificing cold flow characteristics. Additionally, the alkylated diphenylamine which remains in the rubber acts in a manner which provides it with antioxidant protection. In other words, the use of alkylated diphenylamines accomplishes the three major objectives that are realized by employing para-styrenated diphenylamines (reduced molecular weight, regulated polymer macrostructure through branching and antidegradant protection). However, the utilization of alkylated diphenylamines, unlike para-styrenated diphenylamines, offers the additional advantage of being soluble in aliphatic solvents. By virtue of this increased level of solubility in aliphatic solvents, such as hexane, alkylated diphenylamines can be employed at greatly reduced levels of aromatic solvents. Likewise, when mixed catalyst streams containing alkylated diphenyl amines are combined precipitation is minimized compared to para-styrenated diphenylamine significantly improving issues related to fouling. The subject invention more specifically discloses a process for producing cis-1,4-polybutadiene having a reduced molecular weight and improved processability which comprises polymerizing 1,3-butadiene in the presence of (a) an organonickel compound, (b) an organoaluminum compound, (c) a fluorine containing compound, and (d) an alkylated diphenylamine; wherein the alkylated diphenylamine has alkyl groups that contain from 2 to 18 carbon atoms, and wherein the organoaluminum compound and the fluorine containing compound are brought together in the presence of the alkylated diphenylamine.",GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER,RACHITA MICHAEL JOSEPH;;JOHNSON SCOTT EDWARDS,THE GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY (2004-08-27),https://lens.org/081-213-315-034-676,Granted Patent,yes,13,12,7,7,0,C08F10/08;;C08F36/06;;C08F36/06;;C08F136/06;;C08F136/06;;Y10S526/907;;Y10S526/907,C08F2/06;;C08F136/06,526/141;;526/137;;526/340.4;;526/907;;524/722,1,0,,,"Vanox(R) 12 Specification Sheet, R.T.

   A database query optimizer processes an expression in a database query, and generates therefrom an operand list and a corresponding truth table that may be represented by a list of binary characters, where the operand list and corresponding truth table represent a disjunct normal form for the expression. Each expression is stored once it is processed into its operand list and corresponding list of binary characters. New queries are processed into component expressions, and each expression is checked to see if the expression was previously processed and stored as a processed expression. If so, the operand list and list of binary characters for the previously-stored expression may be used in processing the current expression. If there is no previously-stored expression that corresponds to the current expression, the previously-stored expressions are checked to see if any correspond to a complement of the current expression. If so, a new expression is easily constructed for the current expression by retrieving the list of binary characters that correspond to the complement expression, and inverting the bits in the list of binary characters. If there is no previously-stored expression that corresponds to the current expression or its complement, an operand list and corresponding list of binary characters are generated for the current expression. Logical operations between predicates in a query may be performed by performing mathematical operations on the lists of binary characters corresponding to each predicate expression. The end result is an operand list and corresponding list of binary characters that represents the entire expression in a query.

The rotor stage ( 100 ) is arranged such that the engagement load between the damper engagement surface ( 210 ) and the platform engagement surface ( 110 ) is a function of the rotational speed of the rotor stage ( 100 ).",ROLLS ROYCE PLC,BRYANT MICHAEL F;;EDWARDS GARRY M,ROLLS-ROYCE PLC (2016-04-12),https://lens.org/151-839-269-582-592,Patent Application,yes,1,10,13,13,0,F01D5/16;;F01D5/30;;F01D5/34;;F01D5/10;;F01D5/16;;F01D5/30;;F01D5/34;;F01D5/10;;F05D2220/32;;F05D2240/20;;F05D2240/80;;F05D2260/96,F01D5/10,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

    A method of producing a drainage grid or network comprising a number of interlocked strips is disclosed which comprises providing a warp direction a plurality of strips having a channel or channels formed longitudinally therein, feeding such strips into a bonding zone wherein a filter material is bonded over the channel or channels, subsequently providing strips of polymeric material transverse to the warp strips and bonding them thereto to form the weft of the network and thereafter collecting the network or grid so produced. The warp and weft may be produced from yarn reinforced polymeric webbing which is heat bonded to give a mesh. It has been found that polyolefin materials, particularly polyethylene, are suitable. Where reinforcing is provided this may be in the form of reinforcing polyester yarns and are preferably inserted in the longitudinal direction in bundles. The filter fabric may also be a thermoplastic material and may be heat bonded, needle punched or woven. The filter fabric is adhered to, preferably by hot bonding, the warp using an elevated temperature and pressure.

The voltage regulator consists of an error amplifier, an integrator which includes a switched capacitor, a pass transistor, and a feedback circuit. In one embodiment, the integrator circuit includes an amplifier, a capacitor, and a switched capacitor which is driven by a voltage controlled oscillator. The voltage controlled oscillator changes its frequency of oscillation proportional to the output current. In another embodiment, the switched capacitor is driven by a current controlled oscillator whose frequency of oscillation is also proportional to the output current of the voltage regulator. When the output current demand is large, the controlled oscillators increase the frequency which decreases the effective resistance of the switched capacitor thereby changing the frequency of the zero to respond to the change in the load pole. Conversely, the effective resistance is increased as the current demand is decreased, also to respond to the decrease in load pole. The controlled oscillator may be coupled to a current sensing device that generates a scaled version of the load current and couples to the regulated voltage output. The controlled oscillator is restricted to operating voltages that are related to the regulated output voltage and a control current that is a scaled version of the load current. Consequently, the disclosed voltage regulator has high stability without consuming excess power.",ST MICROELECTRONICS INC,CALLAHAN MICHAEL J;;EDWARDS WILLIAM E,,https://lens.org/010-094-945-392-289,Patent Application,yes,0,2,7,7,0,G05F1/565;;G05F1/565;;G05F1/575;;G05F1/575,G05F1/56;;G05F1/565;;G05F1/575;;H02J1/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   Heterogeneous assays for different analytes in a single biological sample are performed simultaneously in a multiplexed assay that combines flow cytometry with the use of magnetic particles as the solid phase and yields an individual result for each analyte. The particles are distinguishable from each other by characteristics that permit them to be differentiated into groups, each group carrying an assay reagent bonded to the particle surface that is distinct from the assay reagents of particles in other groups. The magnetic particles facilitate separation of the solid and liquid phases, permitting the assays to be performed by automated equipment. Assays are also disclosed for the simultaneous detection of antibodies of different classes and a common antigen specificity or of a common class and different antigen specificities. Each type is accomplished by immunological binding at the surfaces of two distinct solid phases in a sequential manner with dissociation of the binding and washing of the solid phase in between the binding steps.

The annulus line within the horizontal tree is adapted to be coupled through the lightweight intervention apparatus to a separate annulus line such that the annulus line is separate from the main bore to facilitate control of the annulus for certain well functions. A significant advantage of this arrangement is that the internal diameter of the main bore is not reduced in any way by apparatus or equipment for separating the annulus line from the main bore so that full bore diameter may be used.
