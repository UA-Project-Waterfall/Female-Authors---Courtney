The method may include monitoring characteristics of media contained within the space using a plurality of sensors, measuring the characteristics from the plural sensors, and controlling the level of media contained within the space using a primary characteristic such as media type and a secondary characteristic such as media level when at least one of the two characteristics meets a predetermined threshold by actuating a device in the space. Exemplary devices may be valves or pumps. In one embodiment, the primary characteristic overrides the secondary characteristic.",MOUNT EVEREST TECHNOLOGIES LLC;;ELLER THEODORE;;SPRAKER JIM,ELLER THEODORE;;SPRAKER JIM,,https://lens.org/051-948-121-786-430,Patent Application,yes,3,0,1,1,0,G05D9/12;;G01F23/263,G01F23/00;;F15B5/00;;G01N33/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING
