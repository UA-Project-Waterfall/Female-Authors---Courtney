A catheter device ( 100 ) can include a longitudinal lumen ( 104 ) and having a proximal end ( 104 a ) and a distal end ( 104 b ). The distal end ( 104 b ) is capable of insertion into at least the internal carotid artery. The catheter device ( 100 ) can include an occlusion balloon ( 120 b ) connected to the distal end ( 104 b ) and operable to occlude blood flow in a blood vessel ( 102 ) by inflation and deflation using a pressurization fluid. The catheter device ( 100 ) can include a pressure sensor ( 110 b ) associated with the distal end ( 104 b ) and operable to measure blood pressure data from at least one of a downstream ( 103 b ) and upstream ( 103 a ) location of the occlusion balloon ( 120 b ) and transmit the blood pressure data to a controller ( 150 ). The occlusion balloon ( 120 b ) can be operable to inflate or deflate based on inflation control information. The catheter device ( 100 ) can be used to treat cerebral thrombectomy in a subject.,UNIV UTAH RES FOUND,ALEXANDER MATTHEW;;GRANDHI RAMESH;;JOHNSON AUSTIN,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH RESEARCH FOUNDATION (2023-11-09);;UNIVERSITY OF UTAH (2023-11-07),https://lens.org/034-529-600-332-601,Patent Application,yes,0,1,2,2,0,A61B17/12045;;A61B17/12109;;A61B17/12136;;A61B2017/00022;;A61M2025/1052;;A61M25/10184;;A61M25/0053;;A61M25/0009;;A61M2025/0042;;A61M25/1011;;A61B5/02141;;A61B5/02241;;A61B5/02152;;A61B5/026;;A61B5/6853;;A61B2562/0247;;A61B5/0225;;A61B5/02158;;A61B5/4064;;A61B5/02141;;A61B5/0215;;A61B5/02233;;A61B17/12045;;A61B2017/00022,A61B5/021;;A61B5/0215;;A61B17/12,,0,0,,,,PENDING
