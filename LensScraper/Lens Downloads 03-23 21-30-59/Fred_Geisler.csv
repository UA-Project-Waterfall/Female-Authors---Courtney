   The invention disclosed herein relates to a site preparation guide for use in conjunction with intervertebral implants. In particular, the site preparation guide contains a hollow body, lumen and interior surface adapted to accommodate and control the positioning of a surgical tissue removal device during the creation of the implant site. The site preparation guide of the invention can further include side openings through the body of the guide to accommodate and control the positioning of a surgical drill, an integrated intervertebral distractor, and a distal endplate which serves as a drilling template for an implant having a corresponding endplate. The site preparation guide is a unitary, one-piece, sterilizable device. Also disclosed herein is a method of preparing an orthopedic intervertebral site using the site preparation guide of the invention and surgical kit including the guide.
