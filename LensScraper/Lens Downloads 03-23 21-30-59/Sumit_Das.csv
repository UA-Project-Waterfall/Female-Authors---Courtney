These distributed systems may include registry system having redundant storage for maintaining the system status. Each registry system may include a server and a storage component. Consensus may be achieved by querying all of other servers of the registry system. In one example, the consensus data may be sharded into independent small groups. This may allow for multiple consensus transactions to be generated and run in parallel, which, in turn may reduce the latency. In addition, or alternatively, requests to a server to write or otherwise change the data-store may be batched at the server side. Thus, for the consensus, the server need only communicate with the other servers only once per batch.
