The designated frames may be a set number of consecutive frames, or the set number of frames dispersed to recur once every 1/K frames. The number of designated frames may be extended by re-transmitting a codeword from the first subset, or truncated by transmitting a stop codeword that is also within the first subset of codewords.

    An arch support orthosis includes an arch curve being variably tensioned for supporting a user's arch and foot. The arch support orthosis includes a metatarsal curve, a curved heel portion and a continuous medial longitudinal arch curve. An anterior slope and posterior slope of the arch curve include varying thicknesses from the base of each slope to a crown of the arch curve. A greater base thickness of each anterior and posterior slope provides firm support of the respective anterior curve and posterior curve of a user's arch, with the crown being resiliently supportive of the user's arch during weighted and unweighted use. A means for tensioning having an adjusting means are connectable under the continuous arch curve between the anterior and posterior slopes, thereby allowing a user to adjust angles of the respective slopes and the tension along the arch curve for treating plantar fasciitis and other foot disorders.

    An arch brace orthotic includes an adjustable arch curve having a plurality of extensions separated by incisions which separate the arch curve surface into multiple resiliently cantilevered extensions. The extensions adjust the arch curve height and slopes during each foot-strike along the arch curve. The weighted arch curve height is returned to an unweighted height by flexibly rebounding of each extension to support the arch of the user's foot. A tensioning means is connectable under the arch brace, providing adjustment of the arch curve height and slope to therapeutically support the user's arch. The arch brace is movable without disassembly between any shoe for treatment of arch and foot disorders. A method of treating plantar fasciitis and related foot disorders includes selectively and periodically adjusting the arch curve height and slopes by manipulating the tensioning means for therapeutic support and user controlled strengthening of the user's arch and foot.

Active speech in VoIP is encoded using, for example enhanced variable rate codec (EVRC), which produces 171, 80 and 16 bits per 20 ms of speech for Rate 1, Rate 1/2 and Rate 1/8, respectively. However, about 60% of the time a user is inactive during a speech session, so an inordinate amount of system bandwidth is comprised of rate 1/8 VoIP packets. In one embodiment of the present invention the apparatus of the present invention identifies the Rate 1/8 voice frame packets and discards them. In another embodiment of the present invention, the apparatus of the present invention identifies the Rate 1/8 voice frame packets and selects some of them for further transmission.

When the insert is attached to the iron-type golf club head strikeface rear surface, it will interact with the iron-type golf club head strikeface when the strikeface deforms and rebounds.

    An apparatus for smoothing a surface of a substrate includes an ionizer to form gas cluster particles; a power supply to accelerate the gas cluster particles; a triode/Einzel lens combination assembly to focus the accelerated gas cluster particles; a permanent magnet beam filter; scan plates to irradiate the filtered accelerated gas cluster particles onto a surface of a workpiece situated in a reduced pressure atmosphere chamber; and a substrate loading/unloading mechanism to load and unload the workpiece. The ionizer includes an alignment device wherein the alignment device includes a X/Y translation element and an angular translation element. The substrate loading/unloading mechanism provides a workpiece from a plurality of workpieces onto a holder positioned at a first position within the reduced pressure atmosphere chamber, the first position being substantially parallel to a central axis of a flow of the filtered accelerated gas cluster particles. The substrate loading/unloading mechanism also moves the holder with a workpiece thereon to a second position, the second position being substantially perpendicular to the first position and the central axis of a flow of the filtered accelerated gas cluster particles.

   A method of estimating an amount of ink contained in an ink reservoir includes the steps of determining a cumulative actual ink drop count of ink drops expelled from the ink reservoir; and determining an evaporation amount associated with the ink reservoir, wherein before a time threshold the evaporation amount is ignored, and upon reaching the time threshold the evaporation amount is used to compensate for an evaporation loss for the ink reservoir by adjusting the cumulative actual ink drop count to form an evaporation compensated drop count.
