Each movable guide member is attached to the movable carriage and has a lower non-linear contour with wear plates, each having a wear surface. When the movable carriage is in an installed position, the wear surfaces are in slidable contact with each other. The wear plates on each guide member are angularly displaced from each other to maintain lateral alignment of the movable carriage and the movable grate block rows, and provide additional wear surface area to increase the useful life of the wear plates. The wear plates eliminate the need for lateral restraints, by maintaining lateral alignment of the movable carriage and the movable grate block rows. A levelling device, including levelling bolts on the fixed guide member, prevents uneven wear of the wear surfaces during operation.",WHEELABRATOR ENVIRONMENT SYST,COLE ARTHUR W,WHEELABRATOR ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS INC (1995-01-23),https://lens.org/027-077-869-460-894,Granted Patent,yes,31,15,1,5,0,F23G5/444;;F23G2205/10;;F23H17/00;;F23H17/00;;F23G5/444;;F23G2205/10,F23G5/44;;F23H17/00,104/134;;110/289;;384/42,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

PHOENIX TELEPHONE & ELECTRIC WORKS, Ltd. Nov. 29, 1955 [Nov. 29, 1954], No. 34563/54. Class 39(2) [Also in Group XXXVII] An emergency lighting unit adapted for mounting on a vehicle, e.g. an aircraft, in which it becomes operative in the event of a crash comprises an insulating body 1 in which a lamp socket 4 is set and connected to terminals arranged to make contact with the terminals of a removable battery, switching being effected by operation of an inertia switch comprising a mass 14 which is normally held in an inoperative position in a channel by the pressure of a light spring 22 and movable within the channel to complete a connection between a battery terminal and the lamp socket. In the example, the movable mass comprises a metal ball 14, e.g. of silver-plated steel, located within a preferably cylindrical bore 15 in the insulating block 1, the ends of the bore being closed by flanged steel plugs 16 held in the block by steel strips 17 joined together electrically by a strip 19. The ball is normally held in midposition, clear of both plugs 16, by a spring- pressed plunger 21 which is recessed at its end to fit the ball and housed with its spring 22 in a metal tube 23 set in the block 1 on a radius of the cylindrical bore. An abutment screw 24 enables the spring- pressure on the ball to be adjusted, e.g. so that a predetermined minimum negative acceleration of one and a half times gravity will suffice to operate the switch. The free travel of the ball is less than its radius, so that when moved into contact with an end abutment 16 it retains contact with the spring plunger 21. To obviate the possibility of the inertia switch being actuated by gravity alone a permanent magnet 31 may be clamped between the steel strips 17 by a bolt 29 and, together with the adjustment provided by the spring-pressed plunger 21, the unit may be arranged to operate at any negative acceleration within a wide range, e.g. 0.7 g to 10 g, or more. To reset the switch after operation, and to switch off the light from the lamp bulb, the ball is returned to its neutral central position by a manually operable yoke or Y-piece 32 on a stem which is slidable within a face plate 2 integral with the insulating block 1, the two limbs of the yoke being provided with rounded ends which engage the ball when the stem is pushed inwardly, and restore it to mid-position. The ends of the limbs are also split so that in their inner position and with the ball central they bridge the gaps between the ball and the end plugs 16 and thus can hold the bulb circuit closed thereby providing a manually operated switch for testing and also when the lamp is detached for use as a hand lamp.",PHOENIX TELEPHONE & ELECTRIC W,COLE ARTHUR GEORGE WILFRED,,https://lens.org/105-125-873-464-987,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,B60Q1/44;;F21V23/0414,B60Q1/44,F4R R244          AF;;F4R R25X          AF;;F4R R254          AF;;F4R R27X          AF;;F4R R27Y          AF;;F4R R271          AF;;F4R R388          AF;;F4R R41Y          AF;;F4R R414          AF;;F4R R62Y          AF;;F4R R621          AF;;F4R R631          AF;;F4R R663          AF;;F4R R68Y          AF;;F4R R681          AF;;H1N NJA           NJA;;H1N N49X          HK;;H1N N649          HK;;H1N N649          NJA;;H1N N660          HK;;H1N N660          NJA;;H1N N700          HK;;H1N N700          NJA;;H1N N701          HK;;H1N N701          NJA;;H1N N702          HK;;H1N N702          NJA;;H1N N73X          HK;;H1N N73X          NJA;;H1N N74Y          HK;;H1N N74Y          NJA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A portable air pressure decay test apparatus for leak testing of a sealed system includes a hollow housing, an air pump having an inlet and an outlet disposed in the housing, and a controller disposed in the housing and connected to the pump for controlling the operation of the pump. A test head is mounted on the housing for releasably attaching to an attachment point of a sealed system. The test head is in fluid communication with the outlet of the pump. When the test head is attached to the attachment point of the sealed system, the controller operates the pump to provide pressured air to the sealed system and raise the pressure in the sealed system to a predetermined value. After the predetermined value of pressure is reached, the controller stops the pump and monitors the air pressure in the sealed system for a predetermined time interval to measure an air pressure decay rate. The controller then compares the measured air pressure decay rate with a predetermined air pressure decay rate to indicate if a leak rate of the sealed system is acceptable. The apparatus preferably includes a power source connected to the pump and the controller disposed in the housing. The power source is preferably a removable battery or the like.

    A portable air pressure decay test apparatus for leak testing of a sealed system includes a hollow housing, an air pump having an inlet and an outlet disposed in the housing, and a controller disposed in the housing and connected to the pump for controlling the operation of the pump. A test head is mounted on the housing for releasably attaching to an attachment point of a sealed system. The test head is in fluid communication with the outlet of the pump. When the test head is attached to the attachment point of the sealed system, the controller operates the pump to provide pressured air to the sealed system and raise the pressure in the sealed system to a predetermined value. After the predetermined value of pressure is reached, the controller stops the pump and monitors the air pressure in the sealed system for a predetermined time interval to measure an air pressure decay rate. The controller then compares the measured air pressure decay rate with a predetermined air pressure decay rate to indicate if a leak rate of the sealed system is acceptable. The apparatus preferably includes a power source connected to the pump and the controller disposed in the housing. The power source is preferably a removable battery or the like.
