The cup-shaped structure includes an elongated setting tab and a thirty-six step edge corresponding to thirty-six spread rate settings on the knob. Operatively engaged with the cup-shaped structure is an abutment tab that is part of a closure structure for blocking and selectively unblocking a hopper opening. The tab engages the setting tab to define the adjustable length of the closure structure. Thereafter, abutment rate selection is a function of the rotatable position of the cup-shaped structure. Engagement of the abutment tab and a step defines the size of the hopper opening and thus the amount of product released from the hopper during operation. The spreader also includes a dual spring arrangement to bias the closure structure to a closed position and to prevent breakage. The disclosed spreader also features a one piece wheel to reduce parts and assembly costs.",OMS INVESTMENTS INC,HAVLOVITZ PAUL;;COURTNEY STEVE;;CAVINS MICHAEL;;GOODWIN RANDY;;LARIMORE DAN,,https://lens.org/104-554-342-206-54X,Patent Application,yes,2,7,11,11,0,A01C15/02;;A01C15/02,A01C15/04,,1,0,,,See also references of EP 1841307A4,PENDING
