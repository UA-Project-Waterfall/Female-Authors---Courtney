The lifting and transporting device is comprised of a U-shaped base having a pair of vertical telescoping supports on which a horizontal frame is mounted. The frame has two horizontal members or rods acting as fulcrums for supporting a rotatable back rest and leg rest which also provide support for a seat. The device is raised and lowered by a hand-cranked screw and nut combination in one of the vertical supports. An articulated connection between the rotatable back rest and the rotatable leg rest permits rotation of these parts from substantially vertical positions to horizontal positions. Attached to the rotatable back rest is an indexing plate which has a plurality of holes cooperating with a spring-biased plunger to lock the device in a variety of positions from upright to flat or in between. An automatic mode is provided by an extension on the indexing plate connected to a fixed length connecting rod pivotally secured to the base frame. This connecting rod causes the back rest and leg rest to automatically rotate from the upright or chair position to a horizontal position or stretcher when the device is raised to its highest position. An outrigger and sling is provided, telescoping into one of the vertical supports for lifting a patientfrom the chair. The outrigger is rotatable from the stored position beside the chair to a position over the chair for use in lifting a patient. Arm rests and adjustable foot rests are also provided.",FISCHER EDWIN L,FISCHER EDWIN L,,https://lens.org/125-672-948-513-797,Granted Patent,yes,5,43,1,1,0,A61G7/053;;A61G7/053;;A61G5/006;;A61G5/006;;A61G5/1059;;A61G5/1059;;A61G7/1019;;A61G7/1019;;A61G7/103;;A61G7/103;;A61G7/1046;;A61G7/1046;;A61G7/1051;;A61G7/1051;;A61G7/1057;;A61G7/1057;;Y10S297/04,A61G5/00;;A61G7/10,005081000R,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

By this means tool transfer can take place at any position of the headstock 50. The pendulum includes a gripper 3 and is moved by an hydraulic or pneumatic jack 20, or by electrical or electromagnetic drives or by rack gears. For constant orientation of a tool the pendulum 2 and link 8 may be constructed as a parallelogram and, for lateral rigidity, may be double-banked. The links and pendulum may be movable laterally and the gripper 3 may be movable relative to the pendulum perpendicular to, or parallel to, the plane of movement of the pendulum. A machine tool may include two pendulum and link mechanisms for moving a tool from the storage means to the spindle and vice versa. The mechanism may be used in connection with transfer mechanism at the storage means and spindle for taking a tool from the gripper 3 and placing it in the storage means or spindle and vice versa. In a machining cycle using only four tools, two pendulums are used with only one storage space. For a cycle using only three tools the pendulums are locked at their positions adjacent the spindle and the transfer mechanism effects the tool change.

Fischer, E., Arnold, P., and Illig, E. May 4. Washing.-In centrifugal machines for removing oil from cleaning - wool, cotton waste, or like materials, by the use of steam, particularly those in which the material is placed in removable gauze or openwork containers or cases inserted in the drum, to enable the steam to act on the material fromall sides, a space is provided between the containers and between them and the periphery and the bottom of the drum. Thus, a centrifugal drum with a perforated periphery f is, as usual, pivotally mounted in a closed casing a, and receives the material to be treated in the usual containers g. These cases g are not in contact with each other, nor with the periphery f, nor with the bottom e of the drum, but they are held in position by distance-pieces or projections m. In this way, there is a free passage through the spaces k, so that steam entering through an opening i in the top of the casing a is better able to force its way into the interior of the material, and so more thoroughly to effect the removal of the oily matter.",FISCHER ERNST;;ARNOLD PAUL;;ILLIG EDWIN,FISCHER ERNST;;ARNOLD PAUL;;ILLIG EDWIN,,https://lens.org/154-403-693-045-907,Patent Application,no,0,2,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
