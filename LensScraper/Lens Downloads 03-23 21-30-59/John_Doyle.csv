Doyle, J. June 27. Points and switches.-Relates to adjusting-means for the pipe - rods or connecting - rods used for operating railway points, signals and the like. The yoke 8, Fig. 3, which is connected to the pipe-rod 17 as shown in Fig. 5, is provided with a head 10 adapted to slip loosely over the adjusting screw-rod 11 but is retained thereon by the fixed nut 12. Two lock-nuts 13, 14 are threaded on the rod and separated from the yoke, as shown, to allow the necessary play between the operating - rods and the point tongues or the like. The opposite end of the screw-rod has a threaded engagement with a second yoke 21, provided with connecting jaws 22, which is locked in its adjusted position by the nut 23. Fig. 4 shows a modified form of yoke, which may be used instead of the yoke 21. The adjustment for bringing the point tongues into close contact with their respective stock-rails is effected by loosening the nut 23 and turning the screw-rod so as to shorten or lengthen the connexion as required, and by shifting the lock-nuts 13, 14.

Initially, the temperature of the oven cavity is sensed to determine if the oven is below a predetermined start temperature TEMP start . Upon confirmation that the oven is below the predetermined start temperature TEMP start , heat and moisture are introduced into the oven cavity until the oven cavity reaches a predetermined maximum temperature TEMP max , at which temperature the oven cavity walls are less than 100 Celsius and the relative humidity within the oven cavity approaches 100%. Heat and moisture can be introduced by energizing heating elements and evaporating water that has been added into the oven cavity or alternatively, by use of a steam generator or through a combination of the two. The oven cavity is subsequently maintained at the predetermined maximum temperature TEMP max  for a predetermined period of time T maintain . Following the predetermined period of time T maintain , the oven cavity is allowed to cool to a predetermined, safe clean temperature TEMP clean  whereupon a signal is provided to alert the user that the cleaning cycle is complete. The invention may be practiced by use of a flame and heat resistant sponge, which prior to the start of the oven cleaning cycle, the user places within the oven cavity and pours or adds water to the sponge. Further, the oven cavity may include a vent opening which is partially obstructed to reduce the cross sectional area of the vent opening during the oven cleaning cycle.",WHIRLPOOL CO,BUZZI ERMANNO;;DOYLE JOHN,,https://lens.org/092-500-614-446-196,Patent Application,yes,5,15,5,5,0,F24C14/005,F24C14/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The tester connects, to the signal-pin track to which the pin under test is connected, a test-signal source (20) that supplies to that pin a relatively high-voltage test signal. The tester actively guards the pin by applying to the remaining component pins, through the tester scanning system and its internal resistance, a signal that has the same voltage as that sensed by the capacitive probe (34). If the component (14) is oriented such that one of the multiple power or ground pins is connected to the signal-pin track to which the test signal is applied, the test signal appears also at the other power or ground pins, since these pins are interconnected by a low impedance path through the component (14). The signals on these interconnected pins are capacitively coupled through the component lead frame to the capacitive probe (34), which senses a much higher voltage than it does when the test signal appears at a single signal pin. Accordingly, the tester determines if a power or ground pin is connected to the signal-pin track by comparing the voltage at the capacitive probe (34) with a predetermined threshold. The tester may also determine how much the component is misoriented by testing each of the pins and comparing the measured voltages with rotation patterns, which are determined by mapping the thresholds associated with the pins of a properly oriented component to the pin locations to which the pins may be rotated if the component were incorrectly oriented.",GENRAD INC,DOYLE JOHN;;COLLETTE JEFFREY,,https://lens.org/109-287-705-973-210,Search Report,yes,4,0,8,8,0,G01R31/2813;;G01R31/312;;G01R31/312;;G01R31/2813,G01N27/00;;G01R31/28;;G01R31/302;;G01R31/312;;H05K13/08,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The drain valve incorporates a check valve assembly which is freely moveable within the drain valve to shift a sleeve to open and close the drain ports. An uphole end of the check valve assembly is above the sleeve and seals to the top of a sleeve to shift the sleeve downhole and open the drain ports. A downhole end of the check valve is positioned below the sleeve in the valve. When the pump is turned on, the downhole end of the check valve assembly moves uphole to seal to the sleeve, creating a positive force to lift the sleeve to block the drain ports. The produced fluids flow through the valve and the production tubing to surface.

   The present invention provides a method to configure the hardware and software resources in a system to utilize two physical interface boards in pairs such that their aggregate units of voice processing DSP resources can be applied to either all of a T1 board's physical interfaces or all of an E1 board's physical interfaces. This allows a single telecommunications system to run as either T1 or E1 with no additional hardware required. The present invention also provides the ability to run protocols normally associated with T1 physical interfaces on a card with only E1 physical interfaces. A method for changing the configuration from T1 to E1 and from E1 to T1 is provided as well. Additionally, the method includes configuring the system to look like a single set of contiguous T1 or E1 channels. Additionally, the method allows for monitoring audio by switching the Pulse Code Modulated (PCM) audio streams from/to an audio enabled resource board and switching between listening to Mu-law encoded audio for T1 and A-law encoded audio for E1. The present invention also permits the system to be cabled as T1 and E1 at the same time.

An uphole end of the check valve assembly is above the sleeve and seals to the top of a sleeve to shift the sleeve downhole and open the drain ports. A downhole end of the check valve is positioned below the sleeve in the valve. When the pump is turned on, the downhole end of the check valve assembly moves uphole to seal to the sleeve, creating a positive force to lift the sleeve to block the drain ports.

    A low-cost, simple, and easy-to-use liquid soap spraying and sponge attachment for a water sprayer. The attachment includes a tubular body which forms a cavity having a first open end on the front side and a second open end on the rear side. The second open end is configured to receive the nozzle portion of the water sprayer while exposing the actuator and the handle portion of the water sprayer. The first open end is configured to allow water from the nozzle portion of the water sprayer to spray through the body in response to actuations of the actuator. A detachable circular sponge is positioned on the front side of the body, preferably using Velcro materials. A liquid soap spraying mechanism of the attachment includes a liquid soap reservoir formed within the tubular body, a liquid soap pump mechanism in the body, a liquid soap nozzle positioned on the front side of the body, and a finger trigger lever positioned on the bottom rear side of the tubular body for spraying liquid soap from the liquid soap nozzle when actuated. Thus, single-handed operation is possible wherein the end-user's hand can move the water sprayer to position the sponge for scrubbing, the user's thumb can activate the water sprayer for spraying water, and the user's index finger can activate the soap sprayer for spraying soap.

    A method for manufacturing pipe joints for connecting two pipe sections in a well bore allows the pipe joint to have increased resistance to compressive and torsional forces. Each pipe joint has a box member for matingly engaging a pin member, the pin member being threadingly connected to the box member to create the pipe joint. Threads are created for the pin member on a tapered exterior surface of a pipe, the threads being axially disposed between a pin end terminal surface and an external shoulder. A tapered surface having a recess is created for the box member on an interior of a pipe, the tapered surface being axially located between a box end terminal surface of the pipe and an internal shoulder, the recess being axially located just behind the box end terminal surface of the pipe. Threads are cut into the tapered surface of the box member, the threads beginning behind the recess and traveling axially away from the box end terminal surface. Since the threading pass for the box member begins behind the recess, threads are not cut through the box end terminal surface giving, this surface an increased contact area. When the pin member and the box member are threadingly connected, the box end terminal surface engages the external shoulder of the pin member. The increased area of the box end terminal surface gives the pipe joint increased compressive and torsional resistance.

The modulation signal is impressed on the carrier, generating a phase and amplitude modulated carrier, The modulated carrier is digitally sampled at a frequency of four times the bandwidth the modulation signal. The digital sampling is initiated substantially contemporaneous with initiation of generating the carrier. A 90-degree phase shift is applied to the digitally sampled carrier to generate a quadrature component of the digitally sampled carrier. A time delay is applied to the digitally sampled carrier to restore time coincidence between the quadrature component and said digitally sampled carrier, and the phase and amplitude modulation signal is extracted by commutation of the time-delayed digitally sampled carrier and the quadrature component of the digitally sampled carrier.

   Under the present invention a biometric reading, an audit point identity and transaction information are collected for each electronic transaction. Upon collection, the biometric reading, audit point identity and transaction information are packaged into an audit packet, which is then encrypted and stored in a log or the like. One or more of the electronic transactions can then be audited using this stored information. Specifically, for the electronic transactions that are to be audited, the corresponding audit packets are retrieved from storage and decrypted. Once decrypted, the biometric readings will be compared to each other to determine whether a set (e.g., one ore more) of the electronic transactions is potentially fraudulent. Typically, a set of electronic transactions is potentially fraudulent if a plurality of the biometric readings are identical or too similar to each other.

A szerv állapota lehet pl. egyimmunológiai vagy toxikológiai behatást követő szervkárosodás. Azeljárás megvalósítása során az izoenzimre specifikus, annak legalábbpikomoláris mennyiségben történő kimutatására elegendő érzékenységű,részecskejelölt, GST elleni antitestet kontaktusba hozzák egybiológiai eredetű mintával, amely feltehetően tartalmazza azizoenzimet, majd a részecskejelölt antitest izoenzimmel képződöttkomplexét befogják egy immobilizált ,,befogó< antitest segítségével,ami vizuálisan észlelhető jelet eredményez. Az eljárás lehetővé tesziGST-izoenzimek kimutatását és meghatározását jellemzően 30 percesnagyságrendbe eső időtartam alatt, az immobilizált GST elleniantitesttel való kezdeti kontaktustól számítva. Az eljáráskivitelezése egyszerű, ezért pl. betegek is használhatják otthonukbanarra, hogy kövessék szervezetükben a megfelelő GST-izoenzim szintjét,máj- vagy veseátültetés után.

Elongated protein filaments are thereafter formed from the slurry by continuously conducting the slurry under pressure through a heat exchanger and heating the slurry to a critical temperature of at least about 280.degree. F. and preferably between about 310.degree. - 335.degree. F. while the protein is subjected to such temperature for a sufficient period of time so that elongated filaments are separated from the slurry. A higher temperature range is necessary with a ""cooked"" rather than uncooked protein source since it has been determined that once the protein source has been cooked it takes more heat to convert it to a protein filament than is required with an uncooked material. The heated slurry is continuously removed from said zone through an orifice and discharged into a collecting zone whereby the elongated filaments are separated from the remaining constituents of the slurry. The noted process provides a distinct improvement over prior art processes which were dependent upon the need for an ""uncooked"" protein source to permit texturization, and discloses a critically defined set of temperature conditions for the production of protein filaments from a protein source which heretofore has been considered unusable in texturization processes.",RALSTON PURINA CO,WAGGLE DOYLE HANS;;LANTER KENT JOHN;;DOISY JOHN R,,https://lens.org/031-323-865-812-173,Granted Patent,yes,7,11,30,30,0,A23J3/26;;Y10S426/802;;A23L13/60;;A23J3/26;;Y10S426/802;;A23L13/60,A23J1/02;;A23J3/04;;A23J3/00;;A23J3/26;;A23J3/28;;A23L13/00;;A23L13/60,426/513,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In one embodiment, the device has a modular design, wherein removable inserts with different functionalities can be positioned between a base component and a collar component. The particular inserts chosen depend on the desired sample preparation or assay to be carried out. The inserts are stacked and are positioned between the base and collar as a unit, so that the stack within the manifold does not move during evacuation of the vacuum chamber. The consistent position of the multiplate facilitates using vacuum sample processing with automated liquid handlers.
