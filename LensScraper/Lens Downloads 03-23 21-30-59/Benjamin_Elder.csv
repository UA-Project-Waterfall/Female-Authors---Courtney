In an embodiment, when a new certificate is generated, a certificate template is used to apply various settings and policies for the new certificate. In various examples, templates may be used to establish default values, enforce required and optional values, place restrictions on one or more data fields, and enforce signature requirements. In some embodiments, the template establishes rules for rejecting certificate requests that don't conform to the template.",AMAZON TECH INC,BOWEN PETER ZACHARY;;CIGNETTI TODD LAWRENCE;;ELDER III PRESTON ANTHONY;;GORMAN BRANDONN;;HOSKINSON RONALD ANDREW;;KOZOLCHYK JONATHAN;;LAWLER KENNETH;;LEVY MARCEL ANDREW;;SCHULTHEISS KYLE BENJAMIN;;SHANTHARAJ SANDEEP;;SHARMA PARAM;;NETO JOSE MARIA SILVEIRA,AMAZON TECHNOLOGIES INC (2020-01-27),https://lens.org/071-818-804-153-499,Granted Patent,yes,60,4,1,1,0,H04L9/3247;;H04L9/3268;;H04L9/3247;;H04L9/3268,H04L9/32,,7,3,030-415-006-904-231;;178-189-924-110-46X;;003-087-818-085-471,10.17487/rfc5280;;10.17487/rfc2986;;10.17487/rfc2985,"Dang, Q., “Recommendations for Applications Using Approved Hash Algorithms,” National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-107, Revision 1, Aug. 2012, 25 pages.;;“Digital Certificates for Every Security Need,” ©2018 DigiCert, Inc., <https://www.digicert.com/digital-certificates> [retrieved Oct. 23, 2018], 4 pages.;;“Digital Certificate Template Best Practices White Paper,” © 2018 Certified Security Solutions, <https://info.css-security.com/white-papers-certificate-templates> [retrieved Oct. 23, 2018], 7 pages.;;“Symantec Private Certification Authority Service (Private CA),” © 2018 DigiCert, Inc., <https://www.websecurity.symantec.com/security-topics/private-ssl> [retrieved Oct. 23, 2018], 9 pages.;;Cooper et al., “Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Ceililicate Revocation List (CRL) Profile,” Request for Comments: 5280, May 2008, 141 pages.;;Nystrom et al., “PKCS #10: Certification Request Syntax Specification Version 1.7,” Request for Comments 2986, Nov. 2000, 14 pages.;;Nystrom et al., “PKCS #9: Selected Object Classes and Attribute Types Version 2.0,” Request for Comments 2985, Nov. 2000, 42 pages.",ACTIVE
