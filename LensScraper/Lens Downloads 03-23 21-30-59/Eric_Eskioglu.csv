The subject invention provides for effective disruption and removal of occlusive material, such as a thrombus, from the body lumen with minimal risk of injury to the lumen wall. Advantageously, the invention can be used to achieve a high degree of removal while minimizing the amount of occlusive material that is released into the body lumen. The subject invention further pertains to methods for disrupting and removing occlusive material from a biological lumen.
