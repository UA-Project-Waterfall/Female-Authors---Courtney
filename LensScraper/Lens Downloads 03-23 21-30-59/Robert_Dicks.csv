The baseboard unit forms an enclosed space through which a conduit extends longitudinally at approximately the horizontal centerline. The conduit and baseboard each include a plurality of laterally spaced openings through which heat may escape, those in the baseboard being at or near floor level, whereby the hot air escaping from the conduit fills the upper portion of the baseboard enclosure before passing through the lower level openings into the room. The baseboard enclosure thus serves as a reservoir for hot air, avoiding abrupt changes in temperature usually associated with forced hot air heating systems.",DICKS ROBERT H,DICKS ROBERT H,,https://lens.org/169-419-078-831-835,Granted Patent,yes,7,13,1,1,0,F24D5/02;;F24D5/02,F24D5/02,98 40C,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The processor executes the instructions in the memory to receive data from a medical device through a wired connection using the device interface, where the data is received through an adapter coupled to the device interface and that communicates with the medical data interchange device using a first communication format and with the medical device using a second communication format. The processor further executes the instructions in the memory to transmit the data to an intermediary device using the data relay transceiver. This system can be implemented in a small, portable unit that is easy for a patient to transport. The adapter can be removably coupled to the medical data interchange device to allow different adapters configured to communicate with different medical devices to be used with a single medical data interchange device.",DICKS KENT;;KENT RALPH;;TRIPP ROBERT;;BARTLETT TERRY;;CROSLEY THOMAS;;MEDAPPS INC,DICKS KENT;;KENT RALPH;;TRIPP ROBERT;;BARTLETT TERRY;;CROSLEY THOMAS,MEDAPPS INC (2007-11-30),https://lens.org/013-820-115-172-212,Granted Patent,yes,100,99,2,85,0,G16H40/67;;G16H10/60;;G16H10/60;;G16H40/67,G06F3/00;;A61B5/00;;G06Q50/00;;G16H10/60;;G16H40/67,705/2;;705/3;;710/15;;710/16;;600/300,87,6,000-951-984-632-581;;077-712-667-916-770;;129-278-969-771-373;;005-624-299-708-465;;034-623-102-935-806;;047-095-759-179-852,10.1147/sj.461.0095;;12845821;;10.1109/memb.2003.1213628;;12834165;;10.1109/titb.2003.811870;;17945927;;10.1109/iembs.2006.259903;;10.1109/memb.2003.1213626;;12845819;;17282669;;10.1109/iembs.2005.1616900,"Blount et al., ""Remote health-care monitoring using Personal Care Connect"", IBM Systems Journal, vol. 46, No. 1, pp. 95-113, (2007).;;Milenkovic et al., ""Wireless sensor networks for personal health monitoring: Issues and an implementation"", Computer Communications, 13 pages (2006).;;Michael Setton et al., ""Bluetooth sensors for wireless home and hospital healthcare monitoring"", Cyberfab, 6 pages, date unknown.;;Korhonen et al., ""Health Monitoring in the Home of the Future"", IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine, pp. 66-73 (May/Jun. 2003).;;""WHMS-Wearable Health Monitoring Systems"", Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Alabama in Huntsville, http://www.ece.uah.edu/~jovanov/whrms/, 13 pages.;;Hung et al., ""Implementation of a WAP-Based Telemedicine System for Patient Monitoring"", IEEE Transactions of Information Technology in Biomedicine, vol. 7, No. 2, pp. 101-107 (Jun. 2003).;;Lee et al., ""Design and Implementation of a Mobile-Care System over Wireless Sensor Network for Home Healthcare Applications"", Proceedings of the 28th IEEE EMBS Annual International Conference, pp. 6004-6007 (Aug./Sep. 2006).;;Chen et al., ""An i-Mode Portable Healthcare Monitor"", Proceedings of the Second Joint EMBS/BMES Conference, IEEE, pp. 1851-1852 (2002).;;Kuo et al., ""Design and Implementation of Internet-Based In-House Healthcare and Home Automation Systems"", IEEE, pp. 2944-2949 (2003).;;Jovanov et al., ""Stress Monitoring Using a Distributed Wireless Intelligent Sensor System"", IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine, pp. 49-55 (May/Jun. 2003).;;Lubrin et al., ""Wireless Remote Healthcare Monitoring with Motes"", Proceedings of the International Conference on mobile Business, IEEE Computer Society, 7 pages (2005).;;Guo et al , ""Implementing a wireless portable healthcare monitoring system for physiological signals"", The Institute of Engineering and Technology, 1 page (2007).;;Otto et al., ""System Architecture of a Wireless Body Area Sensor Network for Ubiquitous Health Monitoring"", Journal of Mobile Multimedia, vol. 1, No. 4., pp. 307-326 (2006).;;Yu et al., ""A Wireless Physiological Signal Monitoring System with Integrated Bluetooth and WiFi Technologies"", Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology 27th Annual Conference, pp. 2203-2206 (2005).;;""Body Area Networks-A ""Healthy Aims"" Projects"", Zarlink Semiconductor Inc., 1 page (2007).;;""Bionformatics"" downloaded from webpage http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics on Aug. 2, 2007 (9 pages).;;Mintz, ""Microsoft Launches Health Records Site,"" downloaded from webpage http://bz.yahoo.com/ap/071004/microsoft-healthvault.html?.v=1 on Dec. 18, 2007 (3 pages).;;""Bluetooth Sig Aims to Improve Healthcare Experience Through Interoperability,"" downloaded from webpage http://www.bluetooth.com/Bluetooth/Press/SIG/BLUETOOTH-SIG-AIMS-TO-IMPROVE-HEALTHCARE-EXPERIENCE-THROUGH-INTEROPERABILITY.htm (2 pages).;;USPTO; Advisory Action dated May 10, 2011 in U.S. Appl.

The systems and methods of the present invention utilize a component that receives software updates (e.g., releases, releases, patches, upgrades, etc.) and presents various installation options to an installer through an interface. The installer can interact with the interface to select one or more components (e.g., controls, menus, menu items, etc) to install and define how such components are installed. For example, the installer can determine a control's location with respect to other controls within a user interface. This can be achieved by moving graphical components within the user interface and/or by providing parameters, setting flags, and/or including suitable arguments. In addition, the installer can add components to an installation. For example, the installer can add proprietary and/or third party applications, features, brands, logos and aesthetics to the installation.",MICROSOFT CORP,KENNEDY KEVIN A;;ST PIERRE ROBERT P;;CLARK LEE DICKS,MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (2004-06-21),https://lens.org/083-096-268-412-808,Granted Patent,yes,12,111,1,1,0,G06F8/61;;G06F9/453;;G06F8/61;;G06F9/453,G06F9/45,717/173,1,0,,,"Gul Agha, et al., A Linguistic Framework for Dynamic Composition of Dependability Protocols, Proceedings of the IFIP Conference on Dependable Computing for Critical Applications, 1993, pp. 1-15.",ACTIVE
