These molecules gather in two-dimensional or three-dimensional geometrical shapes under application of appropriate outside electromagnetic or mechanical signal pumping. The signal pumping triggers synchronization to be induced by resonance vibration of the molecules to participate.SELECTED DRAWING: Figure 1",NAT INST FOR MATERIALS SCIENCE,SUBRATA GHOSH;;SATYAJIT SAHU;;ANIRBAN BANDYOPADHYAY;;FUJITA DAISUKE,,https://lens.org/097-046-485-216-320,Patent Application,no,4,0,1,1,0,,B82Y40/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Schoenite is reacted with aqueous KCl to yield SOP and the filtrate (KEL) is recycled in the kainite to schoenite conversion step. The production of KCl from SEL is carried out with the aid of dipicrylamine (DPA). Lime is treated with DPA in water for the production of highly soluble Ca (DPA)2, which in turn treated with SEL to produce insoluble K(DPA). K(DPA) is treated with HCl to produce KCl and insoluble DPA, which can be recycled for the production of Ca (DPA)2. The aqueous KCl thus obtained is treated with schoenite to prepare SOP.

Kainite is obtained by fractional crystallization of the bittern. Kainite is converted into schoenite with simultaneous removal of NaCl and the filtrate (SEL) is used for production of KCl. Schoenite is reacted with aqueous KCl to yield SOP and the filtrate (KEL) is recycled in the kainite to schoenite conversion step. The production of KCl from SEL is carried out with the aid of dipicrylamine (DPA). Lime is treated with DPA in water for the production of highly soluble Ca (DPA)2, which in turn treated with SEL to produce insoluble K(DPA). K(DPA) is treated with HCl to produce KCl and insoluble DPA, which can be recycled for the production of Ca (DPA)2. The aqueous KCl thus obtained is treated with schoenite to prepare SOP.
