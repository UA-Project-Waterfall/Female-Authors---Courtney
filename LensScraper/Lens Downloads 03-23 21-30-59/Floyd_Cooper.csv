A glass face plate 5  is on the top of the main limb 42  of the L. The face plate has a phosphor layer 6  on its inside surface. A succession 7  of vias and interconnects in the L provides connection from the substrate 1  to the phosphor layer. A band 8  of frit is screen printed onto the inside of the face plate, peripherally of phosphor layer. In a corresponding position on the top of the main limb, a groove 9  is formed.

The first (701) is a preheater, the second (702) is an alignment and irradiation station and the third (703) is a controlled cooling station. Beneath each station, a vacuum pump (710) capable of drawing ultra-low pressures is provided. The preheater is equipped with upper and lower banks of radiant heaters and reflectors (712). The upper heaters are provided above a quartz window (713) of a chamber (714) constituting the station. The pressure in the preheater is pumped down to that in the alignment and irradiation station prior to opening of the gate valve between them and transfer of the face plate and cathode. At the alignment and irradiation station, further heaters (716) are provided. Those above the face plate and cathode, the face plate being uppermost, are mounted on frames (717) about hinges (718), whereby they can be swung up to clear this station's top quartz window, exposing the face plate to the view of an optical system (719) and a laser (720). Manipulation controls (722) are provided for manipulating the position of the face plate to be in pixel alignment, as measured by the optical system (719), with the cathode. The laser is traversed around frit between the face plate and the emission device to cause the frit to melt into contact with both and freeze off once the laser has traversed further. The cooling station (703) has meanwhile been pumped down and the sealed device is transferred to it. The temperature of the device is allowed to rise very slowly, in order to reduce the risk of thermal cracking to as great an extent as possible.
