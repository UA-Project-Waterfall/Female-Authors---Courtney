Liquid electro-photographic developers. DOW CHEMICAL CO. Nov.3, 1967 [Nov.7, 1966 (2)], No.50145/67. Heading G2H. [Also in Division C3] A liquid electro-photographic developer comprises an anhydrous, inert, organic carrier liquid having dispersed therein a cross-linkable resin which contains hydroxyl groups and a catalyst for curing said resin on heating in the absence of solvent wherein the developer has an electrical conductivity at ambient temperatures of 0À5 x 10<SP>-11</SP> to 1À0 x 10<SP>-9</SP> reciprocal ohm centimetres specified resins are silicone and epoxy resins e.g. a phenyl alkyl siloxane resin. Specified catalysts are alkoxy and dialkoxy aluminium salts of fatty acids e.g. octanoic acid and compounds of the formula:- wherein R<SP>1</SP> is a fatty acid radical of 6-12c, n is 2 or 3, m is 1, 2 or 3 and R is alkyl of 1-4C. Specified carrier liquids are isoparaffinic hydrocarbons, chlorofluorocarbons, aliphatic naphthas, odorless mineral spirits and aromatic hydrocarbons. The developer may contain pigments e.g. black and red iron oxide, ultramarine blue, lead phthalocyanine, or copper phthalocyanine and surfactants e.g. halogenated diaryl oxide sulphonates; sodium ligno sulphonates alkyl naphthalene sulphonates and alkali metal salts of sulphonated oils.",DOW CHEMICAL CO,GARRETT WALTER LLOYD;;GILLESPIE HENDERSON CLENDENIN;;SCIAMBI LOUIS JOSEPH,,https://lens.org/033-718-841-615-270,Granted Patent,no,0,0,5,5,0,G03G9/13;;G03G9/132;;G03G9/1355;;Y10S430/105;;G03G9/132;;G03G9/1355;;G03G9/13;;Y10S430/105,G03G9/13;;G03G9/135,C3T T6D9          -;;C3T T6F1          -;;C3T T6J2X         -;;C3T T6J3E         -;;C3T T6J4          -;;C3T T6J8          -;;G2C CC17P         CC17;;G2C CTA           CTA;;G2C C1105         CC17;;G2C C1105         21;;G2C C1106         CC17;;G2C C1106         21;;G2C C1107         CC17;;G2C C1107         21;;G2C C1117         CC17;;G2C C1117         21;;G2C C1124         CC17;;G2C C1124         21;;G2C C1126         CC17;;G2C C1126         21;;G2C C1127         CC17;;G2C C1127         21;;G2C C1128         CC17;;G2C C1128         21;;G2C C1129         CC17;;G2C C1129         21;;G2C C1131         CC17;;G2C C1131         21;;G2C C1132         CC17;;G2C C1132         21;;G2C C1133         CC17;;G2C C1133         21;;G2C C1136         CC17;;G2C C1136         21;;G2C C1156         CC17;;G2C C1156         21;;G2C C1172         CC17;;G2H H10           21;;G2H H5EY          21;;G2H H5F3          21;;G2H H5GY          21;;G2H H5G1BY        21;;G2H H5G2Y         21;;G2H H5G4Y         21;;G2H H5Y           21,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
