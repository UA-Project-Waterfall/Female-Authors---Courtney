   The present invention concerns a device for separating acceptable objects from unacceptable objects. The device includes a moving inclined conveyor having an upper edge and an opposingly located lower edge. Also provided are a plurality of collection cells, with each cell defined by a first wiper and an opposingly located second wiper. The cells are located along the conveyor. At least one feed is also associated with each of the cells, and the at least one feed is positioned to deposit objects on the conveyor at an upper edge near the first wiper. An acceptable object collector is associated with each of the cells. The acceptable object collector is positioned to retrieve objects which have moved downwardly along the conveyor from the feed. The second wiper is positioned to obstruct the movement of unacceptable objects which have moved along said conveyor and to urge unacceptable objects into at least one unacceptable object collector located on the lower edge of said conveyor.
