    A foldable toothbrush having a self-contained storage compartment contiguous with the body of the toothbrush. A pair of storage compartments are connected to one another, one of which is, in turn, connected to an arm assembly. The arm assembly has a pair of members connected to each other. The toothbrush's bristles are attached to the outermost member of the arm assembly. In its fully folded position, the arm assembly's members fold down on one another to form a folded arm section which is folded into one of the storage compartments. The other storage compartment folds down onto the first storage compartment to yield a small, flat, cylindrical case which houses the toothbrush which can easily be stored in a purse or pocket. The foldable toothbrush is designed to be inexpensive enough to be disposable but sturdy enough to withstand repeated use.

    A method of synchronizing a crankshaft signal with the stroke cycle of a four-stroke internal combustion engine induces misfiring in a specified engine cylinder, and uses an assumed synchronization to identify the misfiring cylinder. The crankshaft signal is used to identify reference angular positions of the crankshaft intermediate top dead center positions of consecutive cylinders of the engine firing order, and a time difference between successive reference positions is determined. When the assumed synchronization is such that the current rotation of the crankshaft includes the cylinder in which misfiring is induced, the determined time difference is accumulated in a first accumulator; otherwise, the determined time difference is accumulated in a second accumulator. The presence of misfiring causes the two accumulators to diverge in value, and the direction of such divergence is used to determine if the assumed synchronization is correct or incorrect.

   A method of synchronizing a crankshaft signal with the stroke cycle of a four-stroke internal combustion engine induces misfiring in a specified engine cylinder, and uses an assumed synchronization to identify the misfiring cylinder. The crankshaft signal is used to identify reference angular positions of the crankshaft intermediate top dead center positions of consecutive cylinders of the engine firing order, and a time difference between successive reference positions is determined. When the assumed synchronization is such that the current rotation of the crankshaft includes the cylinder in which misfiring is induced, the determined time difference is accumulated in a first accumulator; otherwise, the determined time difference is accumulated in a second accumulator. The presence of misfiring causes the two accumulators to diverge in value, and the direction of such divergence is used to determine if the assumed synchronization is correct or incorrect.

    A system for use during a medical or surgical procedure on a body. The system generates a display representing the position of two or more body elements during the procedure based on an image data set generated by a scanner prior to the procedure. The image data set has reference points for each of the body elements, the reference points of a particular body element having a fixed spatial relation to the particular body element. The system includes an apparatus for identifying, during the procedure, the relative position of each of the reference points of each of the body elements to be displayed. The system also includes a processor for modifying the image data set according to the identified relative position of each of the reference points during the procedure, as identified by the identifying apparatus, said processor generating a displaced image data set representing the position of the body elements during the procedure. The system also includes a display utilizing the displaced image data set generated by the processor, illustrating the relative position of the body elements during the procedure.
