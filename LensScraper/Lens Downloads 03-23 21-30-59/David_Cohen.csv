For example, longer exposure images of the eye taken at a longer exposure time can show iris or pupil features, and shorter exposure, glint images can show peaks of glints reflected from the cornea. The shorter exposure glint images may be taken at a higher frame rate (than the longer exposure images) for accurate gaze prediction. The shorter exposure glint images can be analyzed to provide glint locations to subpixel accuracy. The longer exposure images can be analyzed for pupil center or center of rotation.

As specifically designed for COVID-19, the payload can be released by furin cleavage, and the Zn released intracellularly by cleavage at a 3CL major COVID protease site replacing sequences naturally found in alpha defensin-5, as one example, or by many other variations encompassing this design. The peptide's entry and intracellular Zn release can be further facilitated by the insertion of an arginine-lysine rich membrane translocation sequence at its amino or carboxyl terminus.

The relatively flexibility of EL devices may also allow them to be readily incorporated into a chromatographic-based assay device for detecting the presence or absence of an analyte within a test sample. ® KIPO & WIPO 2007",KIMBERLY CLARK CO,COHEN DAVID S,,https://lens.org/194-163-928-331-352,Patent Application,no,0,1,8,15,0,G01N21/01;;G01N21/66;;G01N21/76;;G01N21/01;;G01N21/66;;G01N21/76;;G01N21/01;;G01N21/66;;G01N21/76,G01N33/52;;G01N1/28;;G01N21/01;;G01N21/66;;G01N21/76,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

As specifically designed for COVID-19, the payload can be released by furin cleavage, and the Zn released intracellulary by cleavage at a 3CL major COVID protease site replacing sequences naturally found in alpha defensin-5, as one example, or by many other variations encompassing this design. The peptide's entry and intracellular Zn release can be further facilitated by the insertion of an arginine-lysine rich membrane translocation sequence at its amino or carboxyl terminus. The design provides a novel unifying strategy for preventing and treating COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, other coronaviral infections, influenza infections, and many cancers.",COHEN DAVID I,COHEN DAVID I,,https://lens.org/006-453-426-919-680,Patent Application,yes,5,0,3,3,21,A61K47/6811;;A61K47/6841;;A61P31/14;;A61P31/16;;A61P35/00;;C07K16/1003;;A61K47/6841;;A61P31/14;;A61K47/6811;;A61K47/52;;A61K38/1729;;A61P31/16;;A61P35/00;;A61K47/6855;;A61K39/39,A61K38/00;;A61K47/65;;A61P31/12;;A61P35/00,,3,3,001-778-649-354-270;;081-734-267-270-685;;072-088-871-844-227,27270318;;pmc5190028;;10.18632/oncotarget.9713;;pmc3783636;;10.1021/cb400340k;;23841778;;21079686;;pmc2973827;;10.1371/journal.ppat.1001176,"HEPING YAN , VAISHALI KAPOOR, KIM NGUYEN, WALTER J.

A specific DAGRS™ is described constructed of a humanized drug delivery biologic, carboxyl to an Apoptin fragment consisting of Apoptin's proline-rich SH3-binding fragment, a spacer, and a MAP kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation site, in replacement of the SH3-binding domain at HIV-1 TAT's amino terminus. Apoptin is a viral protein with incumbent immunogenicity and toxicity in humans. Improved DAGRS™ constructs are described that replace the viral VP3 peptide with human AKT peptide or derivative, all equivalently spaced 11 amino acids from the initial proline to the beginning of the MAPK phosphorylation site, through which technology the DAGRS™ is fully humanized. DAGRS™ provide for improved bioavailability, enhanced specific activity, and low toxicity for in vivo treatment of cancer. DAGRS™ are a superior method for targeting any oncogene with an inhibitory peptide. An algorithm for “humanization” is described through which human functional equivalent(s) to viral product(s) are identified by alignment of peptides anchored at each end by matching functional motifs that are spaced equivalently distant in the two aligned peptides. The algorithm totally disregards the primary amino acid composition of the spacer, and as such separates from current computer algorithms that prioritize primary amino acid alignments. Accounting for spacing dictates that functional domains be oriented correctly in three dimensions. The invention taught here can be developed into computer algorithms for rapidly identifying these anchored alignments, and thereafter developing safe humanized drugs from disruptive viral activities. Computers once taught the basic rules for anchoring equivalents, can improve on the basic algorithm through artificial intelligence to expand drug development.",COHEN DAVID I,COHEN DAVID I,,https://lens.org/154-251-402-026-889,Patent Application,yes,0,0,2,2,9,C07K14/005;;C12N9/12;;C12Y207/11001;;A61K38/00;;G16B30/00;;G16B20/00;;G16B40/00;;G16B20/30;;G16B30/10;;C07K14/005;;C12N9/12;;C12Y207/11001;;C12N2740/16033;;C12N2740/15033;;C12N2740/16022;;C12N2740/15022;;C12N2740/15051;;C12N2740/16051;;A61K38/00;;C07K2319/09;;G16B30/00;;G16B20/00;;G16B40/00;;G16B20/30;;G16B30/10,C07K14/005;;A61K38/00;;C12N9/12;;G16B20/30;;G16B30/10,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The relatively flexibility of EL devices may also allow them to be readily incorporated into a chromatographic-based assay device for detecting the presence or absence of an analyte within a test sample.",KIMBERLY CLARK CO,COHEN DAVID SAMUEL,KIMBERLY-CLARK WORLDWIDE INC (2005-05-17),https://lens.org/093-839-463-946-546,Granted Patent,yes,104,34,8,15,0,G01N21/01;;G01N21/66;;G01N21/76;;G01N21/01;;G01N21/66;;G01N21/76;;G01N21/01;;G01N21/66;;G01N21/76,G01N21/00;;G01N1/28;;G01N21/01;;G01N21/66;;G01N21/76;;G01N33/52,422/56;;422/57;;422/82.05;;422/82.06;;422/82.07;;436/169;;436/172;;435/6,20,8,004-186-215-720-579;;077-432-970-527-755;;163-777-795-180-07X;;074-042-208-456-147;;022-142-750-024-629;;015-090-469-103-258;;040-943-746-609-192;;102-175-335-109-415,9470488;;10.1021/ac970936z;;8866215;;10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19960801)24:4<312::aid-cyto2>3.0.co;2-h;;10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19960801)24:4<312::aid-cyto2>3.3.co;2-8;;10.1063/1.124227;;10.1016/0584-8539(96)01731-x;;10.1093/clinchem/42.8.1196;;8697576;;10.1093/clinchem/37.9.1502;;1893575;;10.1039/a704220e;;9949727;;10.1021/ac980043m,"Article-A New Tetradentate beta-Diketonate-Europium Chelate That Can Be Covalently Bound to Proteins for Time-Resolved Fluoroimmunoassay, Jingli Yuan and Kazuko Matsumoto, Analytical Chemistry, vol. 70, No. 3, Feb. 1, 1998, pp. 596-601.;;Article-Evaluation of a Time-Resolved Fluorescence Microscope Using a Phosphorescent Pt-Porphine Model System, E.

A specific DAGRS™ is described constructed of a humanized drug delivery biologic, carboxyl to an Apoptin fragment consisting of Apoptin's proline-rich SH3-binding fragment, a spacer, and a MAP kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation site, in replacement of the SH3-binding domain at HIV-1 TAT's amino terminus. Apoptin is a viral protein with incumbent immunogenicity and toxicity in humans. Improved DAGRS™ constructs are described that replace the viral VP3 peptide with human AKT peptide or derivative, all equivalently spaced 11 amino acids from the initial proline to the beginning of the MAPK phosphorylation site, through which technology the DAGRS™ is fully humanized. DAGRS™ provide for improved bioavailability, enhanced specific activity, and low toxicity for in vivo treatment of cancer. DAGRS™ are a superior method for targeting any oncogene with an inhibitory peptide. An algorithm for “humanization” is described through which human functional equivalent(s) to viral product(s) are identified by alignment of peptides anchored at each end by matching functional motifs that are spaced equivalently distant in the two aligned peptides. The algorithm totally disregards the primary amino acid composition of the spacer, and as such separates from current computer algorithms that prioritize primary amino acid alignments. Accounting for spacing dictates that functional domains be oriented correctly in three dimensions. The invention taught here can be developed into computer algorithms for rapidly identifying these anchored alignments, and thereafter developing safe humanized drugs from disruptive viral activities.

The relatively flexibility of EL devices may also allow them to be readily incorporated into a chromatographic-based assay device for detecting the presence or absence of an analyte within a test sample.",KIMBERLY CLARK CO,COHEN DAVID S,KIMBERLY-CLARK WORLDWIDE INC (2005-05-17),https://lens.org/191-169-402-204-111,Patent Application,yes,99,21,8,15,0,G01N21/01;;G01N21/66;;G01N21/76;;G01N21/01;;G01N21/66;;G01N21/76;;G01N21/01;;G01N21/66;;G01N21/76,G01N1/28;;G01N21/01;;G01N21/66;;G01N21/76;;G01N33/52,435/287.2,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

   The movable manufacturing facility brings standard size home building comprehensively within a controlled factory environment. The main structure of the movable manufacturing facility is sufficiently tall to allow assembly and movement of standard size homes within. Multiple independent production lines are established to each produce portions of the dwelling in the form of subassemblies. Finishes, cabinets, appliances, roofs, paint, etc. are installed in the partially completed dwellings prior to houses leaving the production floor. The movable manufacturing facility allows a standard size home under construction to be advanced via a transport element from one production line to the next until complete. The completed homes are subsequently transported on the transport element over a controlled access roadway to individual sites with pre-constructed foundations specifically designed to accept these standard size dwellings. The standard size house can be relocated from the transport element and placed directly onto the foundation. High capacity hoisting, such as clear span bridge cranes, are the key to material handling and transportation on the production lines in the movable manufacturing facility. A drive through alley large enough to accommodate semi-trucks with loaded trailers may be located within the main structure of the movable manufacturing facility.

In one embodiment, an IR sensitive region of an IR pixel underlies the R, G, B sensitive regions of R, G, and B visible pixels. Therefore, the IR pixel receives IR light through a same surface area of the photosensor through which the R, G, and B pixels receive visible light. However, the IR light generates electron-hole pairs deeper below the common surface area shared by the RGB and IR pixels, than visible light. The photosensor also has a charge accumulation region for accumulating charges generated in the IR sensitive region and an electrode above the charge accumulation region for providing a voltage to accumulate the charges generated in the IR pixel.",COHEN DAVID;;YAHAV GIORA;;MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC,COHEN DAVID;;YAHAV GIORA,MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (2011-12-19),https://lens.org/049-959-271-428-569,Granted Patent,yes,18,1,12,12,0,H01L27/1461;;H01L27/1463;;H01L27/14645;;H01L27/14649;;H04N13/207;;H04N13/254;;H04N25/77;;H04N25/131;;H04N25/134;;H04N13/254;;H04N13/207;;H01L27/1461;;H01L27/1463;;H01L27/14645;;H01L27/14649;;H04N25/77;;H04N23/10;;H04N13/207;;H04N13/254;;H01L27/1461;;H01L27/1463;;H01L27/14645;;H01L27/14649;;H04N25/131;;H04N25/134;;H04N25/77,H04N13/02;;H01L27/146;;H04N5/3745;;H04N9/04,,5,0,,,"International Search Report and Written Opinion of the International Searching Authority dated Apr. 29, 2013, PCT Application No. PCT/US2013/020182, filed Jan. 3, 2013, 8 pages.;;""First Office Action and Search Report Issued in Chinese Patent Application No. 201310002216.7"", Mailed Date: Mar. 13, 2015, 12 Pages.;;""Search Report Issued in European Patent Application No. 13733569.1"", Mailed Date: Jul. 3, 2015, 3 Pages.;;Response to Office Action dated Jul. 16, 2015, Chinese Patent Application No. 2013100022167.;;English translation of claims amendment filed in Response to Office Action dated Jul. 16, 2015, Chinese Patent Application No. 2013100022167.",ACTIVE

Classification and verification are standard building blocks in networks systems that provide quality-of-service. However, unlike traditional quality-of-service building blocks, a system of the present invention takes a trust-but-verify approach, and thus can rely on longer-timescale statistical online or offline verification to reduce computational requirements. This improves scalability and reduces the cost and complexity that in part has prevented prior service differentiation systems from succeeding in the Internet.

A network node sitting in the path of packets classifies traffic according to its content, and then statistically verifies that the content actually matches the initial classification. Classification and verification are standard building blocks in networks systems that provide quality-of-service. However, unlike traditional quality-of-service building blocks, a system of the present invention takes a trust-but-verify approach, and thus can rely on longer-timescale statistical online or offline verification to reduce computational requirements. This improves scalability and reduces the cost and complexity that in part has prevented prior service differentiation systems from succeeding in the Internet. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can combine the classification and verification building blocks with a networked directory service to allow further classification as to whether particular content is for pay.",COHEN BRAM;;HARRISON DAVID;;BITTORRENT INC,COHEN BRAM;;HARRISON DAVID,RAINBERRY INC (2017-01-20),https://lens.org/078-299-779-633-943,Granted Patent,yes,6,2,6,6,0,H04L45/04;;H04L45/302;;H04L45/306;;H04L63/14;;H04L67/06;;H04L67/61;;H04L45/302;;H04L63/14;;H04L45/306;;H04L45/04;;H04L67/06;;H04L67/61,G01R31/08;;H04J3/16;;H04L12/28,370/230;;370/389;;370/394;;370/469;;370/401;;709/232,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The method provides convenient, round-the-clock access to callers with convenient control by the called party. By placing a single telephone call to a special telephone number that invokes the disclosed process, termed the Process Trigger Identifier or PTID, a caller can talk directly with the Owner assigned the PTID anywhere that Owner has access to telephone whether at work, at home, in the car, or travelling. Alternatively, a caller can leave a voice (45), facsimile (46), paging, or electronic mail message (47) for the PTID Owner again by placing a call to the PTID of the Owner. A caller is able to accomplish this communication of information with the PTID Owner without need for third-party human intervention such as is typically provided by a secretary or receptionist. The PTID Owner controls what alternatives are available to callers and can conveniently modify these alternatives. The method permits the introduction of voice and data integrated information services to current telephone subscribers while using conventional customer premises terminal device equipment (i.e, telephones (31), modems (33), and facsimile units (32)), and by encompassing providers of information services within its framework. The process can function equally well in customer premises terminal equipment, customer premises switching equipment (26), and central equipment office switching equipment (30).",SENTE CORP,COHEN DAVID;;LARSON GARY P,,https://lens.org/169-499-065-498-896,Patent Application,yes,1,36,2,2,0,H04M3/42;;H04M3/42229;;H04M3/527;;H04M3/5307;;H04Q3/0016;;H04L51/00,H04L12/58;;H04M3/42;;H04M3/527;;H04M3/53;;H04Q3/00,,1,0,,,"TECHNOLOGY CONCEPTS, INC.

Preventing incrustation. WHIRLPOOL CORPORATION. Nov. 13, 1961, No. 40551/61. Class 123 (1). A hot-water heater equipped with means for preventing the formation of calcareous scale internally on the heated surfaces comprises a tank 15 having an inert but thermally and electrically conductive liner 25 covering at least part of the inner surface o the heated part of the tank and connected electrically so that a direct electric current may flow through the water in the tank from the liner to electrodes 41 spaced from the liner. As shown a burner 19 is mounted below the bottom cover 13 of the heater tank and a thermo-electric power source 34 is positioned so as to be operated by the heat from the burner. Minimum and optimum current densities are given as 0.8 and 1.5 milliamperes per square inch of electrode area respectively. The flow of current causes scale to form on the electrodes 41 rather than on the heated surfaces. A double-pole, double-throw switch 30 is included in the wiring to provide means for reversing the current, thereby causing the scale to flake off and drop from the electrodes 41. These particles of scale may be flushed out through a bottom outlet 22 controlled by a valve 23. The liner which may be of graphite or platinum is cemented to the tank wall by a dielectric cement and the connections to the liner and electrodes pass through suitable insulating bushings 28 and 40 respectively.",WHIRLPOOL CO,CROSS JOHN T;;COHEN DAVID,,https://lens.org/059-256-041-805-21X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,F24H9/0042,F24H9/00,C7B BDS           DS102;;C7B BDWA          DWA;;C7B BGD           GD15;;C7B B102          GD15;;C7B B150          GD15;;C7B B510          GD15;;C7B B517          GD15;;C7B B535          GD15;;C7B B607          DS102,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A system includes a brokering arrangement for exchanging information between software modules including notifiers which detect triggering events having corresponding event classes and observers interested in receiving notification of the happenings of the triggering events. The system includes a broker, observers, and notifiers. The software modules are created in discrete addressable locations of a single computer's memory or the memories of multiple computers interconnected through a network. The broker maintains one or more look-up tables having the identities and memory or network locations of all notifier and observer software modules existing in the system, as well as the classes of events with which the modules are concerned. Upon creation of a new notifier or subscription to the broker by an observer module, the broker adds the newly-created module to the one or more look-up tables, which the broker then scans to match notifiers and observers having common event classes. If the broker determines that a notifier and observer share an event class, the broker instructs the notifier to send notification of the happening of the triggering event directly to the observer. The broker, then assists notifiers and observers in establishing direct callback interfaces, but is not involved in later communications between the notifiers and observers after the callback interfaces are established. As new modules are created, and as old modules are removed and/or re-created, the look-up tables are updated and the observers are notified accordingly, thereby permitting so-called hot swapping of software components.

A helical cable management system is provided that enables full rotation to the extent permitted. One or more cables are wound in a helical shape around the axis of rotation, which distributes the deformation of the cable along the helical length. Rotation in one direction causes the helix diameter to increase, while rotation in the other direction causes the helix diameter to decrease. A structure is used to maintain the distance between helical turns, while permitting the increase and decrease of the helix diameter.
