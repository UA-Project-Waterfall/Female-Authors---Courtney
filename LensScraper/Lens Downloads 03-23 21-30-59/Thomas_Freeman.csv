Stacey, F., and Freeman, T. W. July 15. Sifting flour and meal.-Relates to plan sifters, and more particularly to those employed in flourmilling. Fig. 1 shows a plan sifter in vertical section. The reference letters a<2>, a<3>, &c. denote the sifting-surfaces, e<2>, e<3>, &c. the feed and distributing discs, d<2>, d<3>, &c. the outlets from the sieves, and j the central passage for the tailings from the sieve a<2>. The sifting-surfaces a', a<4> are provided with means for breaking up the sluggish stock moving over them. For this purpose three radial arms f are secured to the sifting-surface, and on these arms is secured an annular plate g from which depend pegs, pins, studs, wipers, blades, &c. g<2>, between which the material must work its way as it passes from the external circumference to the interior of the annular sieve. The pegs &c. do not quite touch the sifting-surface, and they may be of circular, square, or other section, and may be fluted vertically or spirally or otherwise roughened. The usual rotating brushes h are applied to the undersides of the sifting-surfaces to clean them. Fig. 7 shows a sieve a<3> fitted with inclined annular barriers or walls m, n to check the too-rapid progress of ""lively"" stock, which heaps up until it overflows the barriers. Fig. 8 shows an annular platform o rising from the annular sieve a<3>. An inclined approach o<3> leads the materials on to the platform. The upper surface of the platform is ribbed or corrugated, and an annular brush q works upon this surface so as to break up flaky particles of the material. The brush q is guided by a vertical flange o<5>, in which openings o<4> are formed for the passage of the materials. The rotation of the brush is due to the gyratory movement of the sieve, as in the case of the usual cleaning-brushes h.",STACEY FRANK;;FREEMAN THOMAS WILLIAM,STACEY FRANK;;FREEMAN THOMAS WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/012-832-337-649-938,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The rear end of each guideway is steeply upwardly and rearwardly inclined but forward of the pickup conveyor. A corresponding plurality of powered endless overhead assist chains are supported by the front and rear ends of the assist frame and the guideways for movement in a path extending horizontally rearwardly along the guideways, then up steeply with increasing spacing from the pickup conveyor to the rear end, and then downwardly and forwardly to the front end. From each chain a series of flexible projections extend out substantially normally. When the assist chain moves along its guideway, some projections extend down into tomato vines and engage them, and then they carry the vines upwardly steeply along the steeply inclined portion of the loop. A series of vine releasing tines extend downwardly and then rearwardly and act to free the cut vines from the assist chains when the vines lie over the pickup conveyor, thereby insuring transfer of the vines fully to the pickup conveyor.",UNIV CALIFORNIA,BETTENCOURT THOMAS S;;FREEMAN DANIEL L,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THE (1981-01-05),https://lens.org/130-174-870-128-678,Granted Patent,yes,17,12,1,1,0,A01D45/006;;A01D45/006,A01D45/00,56327R,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Compressing solids-liquids mixtures into briquettes. COAL INDUSTRY (PATENTS) Ltd. July 10, 1959 [April 11, 1958], No. 11563/58. Class 87(2). Liquid is removed from a mass of particles, e.g. coal particles, as they are compressed into briquettes in apparatus which comprises a plunger 11 to force the particles through a nozzle of increasing cross-sectional area, passages 12 in the nozzle (and/or the plunger) so that liquid can escape in one or more directions different from the direction of movement of the plunger and means for adjusting the nozzle to control the pressure in the mass. The moving part 15A of the adjustable nozzle is hinged to the fixed part 15 and is engaged by a piston 32 marking in a cylinder 25. When a cam 17 on the plunger 11 opens a valve 19, oil pressure in the space 16 above the plunger is transmitted to a control valve 22 similar to the control valve described in Specification 875, 441. The operation of the valve 22 is such that high pressure oil passes to the cylinder 25 if the pressure in the space 16 is too low and oil escapes from the cylinder 25 if the pressure in the space 16 is too high, so providing automatic adjustment of the nozzle whereby constant frictional resistance is applied to the moving mass of particles.",COAL INDUSTRY PATENTS LTD,KNOWLES BRIAN GEOFFREY;;FREEMAN DAVID THOMAS,,https://lens.org/196-377-085-818-782,Granted Patent,no,0,3,1,1,0,B30B11/225;;B30B9/02;;C10L5/06,B30B9/02;;B30B11/22;;C10L5/06,B5A ADX           29;;B5A AD29          29;;B5A AT17X         T17X;;B5A A1G10         T17X;;B5A A1G15         T17X;;B5A A1G7AX        T17X;;B5A A1G7A1        T17X;;B5A A1R130        T17X;;B5A A1R130        29;;B5A A1R412        T17X;;B5A A1R412        29;;B5A A2D1X         T17X;;B5A A2D1X         29;;B5A A2E10         29;;B5A A2E8          29;;B5A A2J           29;;B5A A2L           T17X;;B5A A2M           T17X;;B5A A2P2          T17X;;B5A A2R           29;;B5A A20T17        29,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A laser eye surgery system includes a laser for producing a laser beam capable of making refractive corrections, an optical system for shaping and conditioning the laser beam, a digital micromirror device (DMD) for reflecting the shaped and conditioned beam toward the eye, a computer system for controlling the mirrors of the DMD, and an eye tracking system which tracks the position of the eye and provides feedback to the computer system. The computer system includes software which permits the DMD to emulate the patterns and laser beam control provided in all prior art broadbeam systems and scanning spot systems. All that is required is a selection in the software to operate thereunder. Moreover, the laser surgery system can be coupled to or adapted to receive data from corneal topographers or wavefront sensor systems and utilize such data to increase the quality of correction above and beyond prior approaches. Furthermore, the laser surgery system can provide much greater resolution than prior art systems.

The invention also concerns proliferation factors, and compositions containing the factors, which are capable of increasing the proliferation potential of any human or other animal cell in culture. The subject invention further pertains to a method for proliferating cells in culture by contacting cells with the proliferation factors. The proliferated cells can range in plasticity and can include, for example, blast cells, fertilized ova, non-fertilized gametes, embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells, precursor or progenitor cells, and highly specialized cells. Optionally, the cells can be induced to cease proliferation. The proliferated cells of the subject invention are useful for cell therapy, cell/gene therapy, biological production of molecules, and as in vitro models for research, toxicity testing, and drug

The particle size distribution curve is maintained with a maximum particle sizing of 6 microns so as to not allow for coarser drilled solids to degrade beyond the point of mechanical separation to prevent a build-up of low gravity solids that can no longer be removed from the drilling fluid during the drilling operation due to their size. An optimal drilling system requires that drilling fluids be modified through the following process to attain the appropriate particle sizing distribution to: make the most efficient use of the drilling operation, reduce the amount to drilling fluids utilized, and reduce formation damage.

The treatment of clay can also involve the auxiliary use of a surfactant in small amounts, which is utilized to emulsify the silane and aliphatic alcohol treatment components in water either individually or as a coemulsion blend prior to their addition to the clay. The surfactant, which is preferably a nonionic surfactant having a HLB value of 12 - 18, aides in uniformly treating all the clay particle surfaces with the silane/alcohol treatment combination. Coarse particle clays having general utility in the invention are those having an average Stokes equivalent particle diameter of at least 3.0 microns, while the coarse particle ATH fillers having general utility in the invention are those having a BET surface area value less than 5.0 m2/g. Clays or ATH so treated with the inventive silane/alcohol treatment provide unique viscosity reduction benefits in thermoset polymers unattainable by using either treatment additive alone in any amount.

When a user defines the first path on the WORM volume, a first file directory group (140) is created for that path. A path directory entry pointing to this file directory group is written to the path directory group (130). Files having this path name are initially written into the first data file area (150) next to this file directory group. The first data file area grows as data is written into it. When a second path is defined, the first data file area is closed and a second file directory group (160) is created on the WORM volume next to the first data file area, thereby wasting little if any space. The path directory group is updated with a new path directory entry that points to this new file directo­ry group. Files having this second path name are written into a growing second data area. If the user now wants a file having the first path name to be written to the disk, a file directory entry is placed in the first file direc­tory group, but the file itself is written into the grow­ing second data file area. In this manner, files are associated with directory entries by a common path name, not necessarily physical location on the disk, although files tend to be relatively close to their associated directory entry.

   A hub assembly for a data storage disk comprises a hub member and a raised boss near a center axis of the hub member, the raised boss being surrounded by an annular bonding surface and being configured so as to protrude into a center hole of a data storage disk when the bonding surface is in contact with a surface of the disk. Two hub assemblies are disposed on opposite sides of the disk, the respective raised bosses of the hub assemblies protrude into a center hole of the disk, where they are bonded to each other to increase the overall bonding force between the hub assemblies and the disk. The hub assemblies and disk may be bonded together using a UV curable adhesive. The hub assembly may also include a metal hub plate that is used to magnetically clamp the disk/hub assembly to the spindle of a disk drive. In one embodiment, the metal hub plate has several tabs that are bent around the disk to attach the metal hub plate to the disk. The metal hub also has features, such as notches, that are used to register the metal plate correctly with a die that is used in the process of bending the metal tabs. The hub member may comprise a material that transmits UV radiation, e.g., an optical grade plastic such as optical grade polycarbonate. In this embodiment, the hub member can act as a light pipe that transmits incident UV radiation to a UV curable adhesive at an interface between the hub assembly and a data storage disk or an interface with another hub assembly located on the opposite side of the disk. The UV curable adhesive may be cured by using the hub member as a light pipe to transmit the UV radiation to the adhesive.

A generally tubular fishing tool 100 has a side opening 19 extending through the lowermost end. Such side opening 19 has a longitudinally disposed first surface 12 and a helically disposed second surface 14, both of which are tapered so as to guide the fiberglass strands inwardly into the bore of the fishing tool 100 as it is simultaneously rotated and lowered. The fishing tool has means 40 to grip the sucker rod string within its bore above the side opening. As the fishing tool is lowered down and around the separated end of the sucker rod, the fishing tool is rotated to bundle the numerous loose fiberglass strands 90 inwardly into the fishing tool bore by action of the tapered surfaces 12 14 of the side opening so that the bundled fiberglass strands do not ball up or plug the bore of the fishing tool. The fishing tool is then lowered to grip the sucker rod string and then lifted from the well bore together with the sucker string. <IMAGE>",FIBERFLEX PROD INC,RUTLEDGE RUSSEL PAUL;;FREEMAN JOHN EDWARD;;RUTLEDGE WOODROW THOMAS,,https://lens.org/068-644-475-806-35X,Patent Application,no,0,12,4,4,0,E21B31/125;;E21B31/18,E21B31/12;;E21B31/18,E1F FAW           FAW;;E1F FAW7          FAW,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

An optimal drilling system requires that drilling fluids be modified through the following process to attain the appropriate particle sizing distribution to: make the most efficient use of the drilling operation, reduce the amount to drilling fluids utilized, and reduce formation damage.

The path directory group is updated with a new path directory entry that points to this new file directory group. Files having this second path name are written into a growing second data area. If the user now wants a file having the first path name to be written to the disk, a file directory entry is placed in the first file directory group, but the file itself is written into the growing second data file area. In this manner, files are associated with directory entries by a common path name, not necessarily physical location on the disk, although files tend to be relatively close to their associated directory entry.",IBM,FREEMAN HARRISON L;;HOAG THOMAS MARSHALL;;MUSTAIN RICHARD GLEN,,https://lens.org/157-790-905-516-670,Granted Patent,yes,18,19,5,5,0,G06F16/902;;G06F16/10;;G06F16/10;;G06F16/902,G06F12/00;;G06F17/30;;G06F3/08,369/48;;369/59;;707/200,6,0,,,"H.

The method of treatment involves the use of specific weight ratio combinations of a silane and a long chain aliphatic alcohol. The treatment of clay can also involve the auxiliary use of a surfactant in small amounts, which is utilized to emulsify the silane and aliphatic alcohol treatment components in water either individually or as a co-emulsion blend prior to their addition to the clay. The surfactant, which is preferably a nonionic surfactant having a HLB value of 12-18, aides in uniformly treating all the clay particle surfaces with the silane/alcohol treatment combination. Coarse particle clays having general utility in the invention are those having an average Stokes equivalent particle diameter of at least 3.0 microns, while the coarse particle ATH fillers having general utility in the invention are those having a BET surface area value less than 5.0 m.sup.2 /g. Clays or ATH so treated with the inventive silane/alcohol treatment provide unique viscosity reduction benefits in thermoset polymers unattainable by using either treatment additive alone in any amount. This low viscosity characteristic allows the treated mineral products to be used at high loadings in various thermoset compounds, as fillers or extenders, which is advantageous in terms of reducing cost and/or gaining certain performance properties, such as physical reinforcement, composite surface smoothness or flame retardancy.",HUBER CORP J M,MARSHALL CARL J;;LYNCH THOMAS J;;FREEMAN GARY M,J.M.

An optimal drilling system requires that drilling fluids be modified through the following process to attain the appropriate particle sizing distribution to: make the most efficient use of the drilling operation, reduce the amount to drilling fluids utilized, and reduce formation damage.

SOLUTION: The camera is provided with the magnetically coated film 14 extended from a spool 16 to a cassette 18. A selector switch 22 is connected to the permanent magnet 26 through an arm 24 and can be moved to one of three positions C, H and P. The magnet 26 does not ordinarily come in contact with a film surface and is arranged very separately therefrom, so that recording is not performed on the film 14. When a photograph is taken by depressing a shutter botton 28, a link 30 brings the magnet 26 into contact with the film surface so as to record the magnetic mark. The relative position of the mark to the frame decides the format to print the photograph (position C, H or P).",EASTMAN KODAK CO,FREEMAN JAY DAVIS;;CARR THOMAS D;;CHAMBERLAIN IV FREDERICK R,,https://lens.org/108-897-955-460-276,Patent Application,no,0,0,3,3,0,G03B17/24;;G03B17/24,G03C3/00;;G03B17/24;;G11B5/633;;G11B31/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

    Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) differentiate into neuron-like phenotypes in vitro and in vivo, engrafted into normal or denervated rat striatum. The BMSC did not remain localized to the site of the graft, but migrated throughout the brain and integrated into specific brain regions in various architectonic patterns. The most orderly integration of BMSC was in the laminar distribution of cerebellar Purkinje cells, where the BMSC-derived cells took on the Purkinje phenotype. The BMSC exhibited site-dependent differentiation and expressed several neuronal markers including neuron-specific nuclear protein, tyrosine hydroxylase and calbindin. BMSC can be used to target specific brain nuclei in strategies of neural repair and gene therapy.

The most orderly integration of BMSC was in the laminar distribution of cerebellar Purkinje cells, where the BMSC-derived cells took on the Purkinje phenotype. The BMSC exhibited site-dependent differentiation and expressed several neuronal markers including neuron-specific nuclear protein, tyrosine hydroxylase and calbindin.

The electrode has an expanded fning end protruding from the insulator bottom, Tabs at an upper end of the electrode are expanded inside the bore to engage the insulator, and this is done using a removable expanding tool inserted into the insulator. A conductive glass in granular form is poured into the bore and envelops the expanded upper end of the electrode. A sacrificial conductive push pin inserts into the upper bore over the glass granules. The sub-assembly is heated to melt the glass and the push pin is pressed down into the melted glass. Upon cooling, the glass within the insulator fuses forming a seal which further strengthens the flared en agement of the electrode to the insulator.",FEDERAL MOGUL CORP;;DOWNS DARREN C;;FREEMAN ROBERT D;;GEER LAWRENCE W;;NOHL THOMAS,DOWNS DARREN C;;FREEMAN ROBERT D;;GEER LAWRENCE W;;NOHL THOMAS,,https://lens.org/121-989-685-404-23X,Patent Application,yes,2,0,2,2,0,H01T13/38;;H01T13/38;;H01T13/34;;H01T13/34;;H01T21/02;;H01T21/02,H01T13/34;;H01T13/38;;H01T21/02,,0,0,,,,PENDING

   Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) differentiate into neuron-like phenotypes in vitro and in vivo, engrafted into normal or denervated rat striatum. The BMSC did not remain localized to the site of the graft, but migrated throughout the brain and integrated into specific brain regions in various architectonic patterns. The most orderly integration of BMSC was in the laminar distribution of cerebellar Purkinje cells, where the BMSC-derived cells took on the Purkinje phenotype. The BMSC exhibited site-dependent differentiation and expressed several neuronal markers including neuron-specific nuclear protein, tyrosine hydroxylase and calbindin. BMSC can be used to target specific brain nuclei in strategies of neural repair and gene therapy.
