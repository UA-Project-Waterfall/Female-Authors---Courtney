A virtual network creates one or more images of one or more communication device by emulating one or more features of said communication device. The emulated features are further synchronized in real-time such that the user is further allowed to customize the features stored in the virtual network. The first communication device communicates with the virtual network for supporting the execution of one or more images thus created by means of a virtual interface. An execution module present in the first communication device first installs and later runs one or more virtual images thus created. A unique number is generated by a processing device of the first communication device in order to provide an uninterrupted connectivity with people in contact list irrespective of the service provider thus chosen by the user.
