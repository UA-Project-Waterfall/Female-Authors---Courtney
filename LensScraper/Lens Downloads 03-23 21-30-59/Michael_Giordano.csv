   Methods of and systems for illuminating objects using planar laser illumination beams having substantially-planar spatial distribution characteristics that extend through the field of view (FOV) of image formation and detection modules employed in such systems. Each planar laser illumination beam is produced from a planar laser illumination beam array (PLIA) comprising an plurality of planar laser illumination modules (PLIMs). Each PLIM comprises a visible laser diode (VLD, a focusing lens, and a cylindrical optical element arranged therewith. The individual planar laser illumination beam components produced from each PLIM are optically combined to produce a composite substantially planar laser illumination beam having substantially uniform power density characteristics over the entire spatial extend thereof and thus the working range of the system. Preferably, each planar laser illumination beam component is focused so that the minimum beam width thereof occurs at a point or plane which is the farthest or maximum object distance at which the system is designed to acquire images, thereby compensating for decreases in the power density of the incident planar laser illumination beam due to the fact that the width of the planar laser illumination beam increases in length for increasing object distances away from the imaging optics. By virtue of the present invention, it is now possible to use both VLDs and high-speed CCD-type image detectors in conveyor, hand-held and hold-under type scanning applications alike, enjoying the advantages and benefits that each such technology has to offer, while avoiding the shortcomings and drawbacks hitherto associated therewith.

This feedback or control data is used to dynamically generate the necessary values for the adjusted diode drive currents that are used to drive the visible and invisible laser diodes and produce an illumination beam having a dynamically managed ratio of visible to invisible (IR) spectral energy/power required to produce images of sufficient image contrast to ensure satisfactory image processing, while minimizing visual brightness to humans, at a POS station during object illumination and imaging operations.",KNOWLES C HARRY;;ZHU XIAOXUN;;GOOD TIMOTHY;;XIAN TAO;;KOTLARSKY ANATOLY;;VEKSLAND MICHAEL;;HERNANDEZ MARK;;GARDNER JOHN;;ESSINGER STEVEN;;GIORDANO PATRICK;;KEARNEY SEAN;;SCHMIDT MARK;;FURLONG JOHN A;;CIARLANTE NICHOLAS;;LIU YONG;;REN JIE;;TAO XI;;LIU JIBIN;;ZHUO MING;;ELLIS DUANE,KNOWLES C HARRY;;ZHU XIAOXUN;;GOOD TIMOTHY;;XIAN TAO;;KOTLARSKY ANATOLY;;VEKSLAND MICHAEL;;HERNANDEZ MARK;;GARDNER JOHN;;ESSINGER STEVEN;;GIORDANO PATRICK;;KEARNEY SEAN;;SCHMIDT MARK;;FURLONG JOHN A;;CIARLANTE NICHOLAS;;LIU YONG;;REN JIE;;TAO XI;;LIU JIBIN;;ZHUO MING;;ELLIS DUANE,METROLOGIC INSTRUMENTS INC (2007-10-01),https://lens.org/193-570-720-990-81X,Patent Application,yes,2,0,39,975,0,A47F9/046;;G02B27/48;;G06K7/10544;;G06K7/10564;;G06K7/10574;;G06K7/10613;;G06K7/10623;;G06K7/10693;;G06K7/10712;;G06K7/10722;;G06K7/10732;;G06K7/10782;;G06K7/10792;;G06K7/10851;;G06K7/10861;;G06K2207/1012;;G06Q20/208;;G06Q30/06;;G07G1/0036;;G07G1/0045;;G07G3/00;;G07G3/006;;G06V10/141;;A47F9/046;;G07G1/0045;;G06K2207/1012;;G06Q20/208;;G06K7/10613;;G06K7/10712;;G06K7/10693;;G06K7/10623;;G06K7/10792;;G07G3/006;;G06K7/10574;;G06K7/10544;;G07G1/0036;;G06Q30/06;;G02B27/48;;G06K7/10851;;G06K7/10861;;G07G3/00;;G06K7/10782;;G06K7/10564;;G06K7/10732;;G06K7/10722;;G06V10/141,G06K7/10;;G06V10/141,235/462.42,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The method comprises provides, at a POS environment, a digital image capture and processing system having a system housing with an imaging window, and an area-type illumination and imaging station disposed within said system housing, for projecting a coextensive area-type illumination and imaging field (i.e. zone) through said imaging window into a 3D imaging volume during object illumination and imaging operations. As the object is moved through the 3D imaging volume, its motion is automatically detected, and signals indicative of said detected object motion are generated. In response to the generated signals, a first field of visible illumination is produced from an array of visible LEDs, simultaneously with a second field of invisible illumination from a array of infrared (IR) LEDs. These first and second fields of illumination spatially overlap and intermix with each other and are substantially coextensive with the FOV. During object illumination and imaging operations, the relative power ratio (VIS/IR) of these fields of visible illumination and invisible illumination are controlled as one or more digital images of said illuminated object are formed and detected, captured and buffered, and ultimately processed so as to read one or more 1D and/or 2D code symbols graphically represented in the digital images.

The system comprises a coplanar illumination and imaging station for projecting at least one coplanar illumination and imaging plane into an imaging volume during object illumination and imaging operations. The coplanar illumination and imaging station includes an illumination subsystem for producing a first field of visible illumination from an array of visible VLDs, and producing a second field of invisible illumination from an array of infrared (IR) laser diodes (IR-LDs). Wherein the first and second fields of illumination spatially overlap and intermix with each other and are substantially coplanar with the FOV of the linear image sensing array. An automatic object detection subsystem automatically detects an object moving through the imaging volume, while an illumination control subsystem controls the relative power ratio (VIS/IR) of visible illumination and invisible illumination during system operation so as to minimize the amount of visible illumination energy required to capture sufficiently high-contrast images of said objects and successfully process the same.",METROLOGIC INSTRUEMTNS INC,KNOWLES C HARRY;;ZHU XIAOXUN;;GOOD TIMOTHY;;XIAN TAO;;KOTLARSKY ANATOLY;;VEKSLAND MICHAEL;;HERNANDEZ MARK;;GARDNER JOHN;;ESSINGER STEVEN;;GIORDANO PATRICK;;KEARNEY SEAN;;SCHMIDT MARK;;FURLONG JOHN A;;CIARLANTE NICHOLAS;;LIU YONG;;REN JIE;;TAO XI;;LIU JIBIN;;ZHUO MING;;ELLIS DUANE,METROLOGIC INSTRUMENTS INC (2007-10-01),https://lens.org/160-973-037-169-268,Granted Patent,yes,99,22,39,975,0,A47F9/046;;G02B27/48;;G06K7/10544;;G06K7/10564;;G06K7/10574;;G06K7/10613;;G06K7/10623;;G06K7/10693;;G06K7/10712;;G06K7/10722;;G06K7/10732;;G06K7/10782;;G06K7/10792;;G06K7/10851;;G06K7/10861;;G06K2207/1012;;G06Q20/208;;G06Q30/06;;G07G1/0036;;G07G1/0045;;G07G3/00;;G07G3/006;;G06V10/141;;A47F9/046;;G07G1/0045;;G06K2207/1012;;G06Q20/208;;G06K7/10613;;G06K7/10712;;G06K7/10693;;G06K7/10623;;G06K7/10792;;G07G3/006;;G06K7/10574;;G06K7/10544;;G07G1/0036;;G06Q30/06;;G02B27/48;;G06K7/10851;;G06K7/10861;;G07G3/00;;G06K7/10782;;G06K7/10564;;G06K7/10732;;G06K7/10722;;G06V10/141,G06V10/141;;G06K7/10,235/462.14;;235/462.24;;235/462.42,6,0,,,"Product brochure for the LMC555 CMOS Timer by National Semiconductor Corporation, Mar. 2002, pp. 1-10.;;Powerpoint demonstration of the Code Reader 2.0 (CR2)-All Applications Reader, Code Corporation, www.codecorp.com, Apr. 6, 2004, pp. 1-10.;;Press Release entitled ""Code Corporation's New Imager Offers Revolutionary Performance and Bluetooth Radio"", by Benjamin M.

This feedback or control data is used to dynamically generate the necessary values for the adjusted diode drive currents that are used to drive the visible and invisible laser diodes and produce an illumination beam having a dynamically managed ratio of visible to invisible (IR) spectral energy/power required to produce images of sufficient image contrast to ensure satisfactory image processing, while minimizing visual brightness to humans, at a POS station during object illumination and imaging operations.",METROLOGIC INSTR INC,KNOWLES C HARRY;;ZHU XIAOXUN;;GOOD TIMOTHY;;XIAN TAO;;KOTLARSKY ANATOLY;;VEKSLAND MICHAEL;;HERNANDEZ MARK;;GARDNER JOHN;;ESSINGER STEVEN;;GIORDANO PATRICK;;KEARNEY SEAN;;SCHMIDT MARK;;FURLONG JOHN A;;CIARLANTE NICHOLAS;;LIU YONG;;REN JIE;;TAO XI;;LIU JIBIN;;ZHUO MING;;ELLIS DUANE,METROLOGIC INSTRUMENTS INC (2007-10-01),https://lens.org/194-230-352-362-240,Granted Patent,yes,101,36,39,975,0,A47F9/046;;G02B27/48;;G06K7/10544;;G06K7/10564;;G06K7/10574;;G06K7/10613;;G06K7/10623;;G06K7/10693;;G06K7/10712;;G06K7/10722;;G06K7/10732;;G06K7/10782;;G06K7/10792;;G06K7/10851;;G06K7/10861;;G06K2207/1012;;G06Q20/208;;G06Q30/06;;G07G1/0036;;G07G1/0045;;G07G3/00;;G07G3/006;;G06V10/141;;A47F9/046;;G07G1/0045;;G06K2207/1012;;G06Q20/208;;G06K7/10613;;G06K7/10712;;G06K7/10693;;G06K7/10623;;G06K7/10792;;G07G3/006;;G06K7/10574;;G06K7/10544;;G07G1/0036;;G06Q30/06;;G02B27/48;;G06K7/10851;;G06K7/10861;;G07G3/00;;G06K7/10782;;G06K7/10564;;G06K7/10732;;G06K7/10722;;G06V10/141,G06V10/141;;G06K7/10,235/462.42;;235/462.01;;235/462.09;;235/462.43,6,0,,,"Product brochure for the LMC555 CMOS Timer by National Semiconductor Corporation, Mar. 2002, pp. 1-10.;;Powerpoint demonstration of the Code Reader 2.0 (CR2)-All Applications Reader, Code Corporation, www.codecorp.com, Apr. 6, 2004, pp. 1-10.;;Press Release entitled ""Code Corporation's New Imager Offers Revolutionary Performance and Bluetooth Radio"", by Benjamin M.

Each planar laser illumination beam is produced from a planar laser illumination beam array (PLIA) comprising an plurality of planar laser illumination modules (PLIMs). Each PLIM comprises a visible laser diode (VLD, a focusing lens, and a cylindrical optical element arranged therewith. The individual planar laser illumination beam components produced from each PLIM are optically combined to produce a composite substantially planar laser illumination beam having substantially uniform power density characteristics over the entire spatial extend thereof and thus the working range of the system.

   Methods of and systems for illuminating objects using planar laser illumination beams having substantially-planar spatial distribution characteristics that extend through the field of view (FOV) of image formation and detection modules employed in such systems. Each planar laser illumination beam is produced from a planar laser illumination beam array (PLIA) comprising an plurality of planar laser illumination modules (PLIMs). Each PLIM comprises a visible laser diode (VLD, a focusing lens, and a cylindrical optical element arranged therewith. The individual planar laser illumination beam components produced from each PLIM are optically combined to produce a composite substantially planar laser illumination beam having substantially uniform power density characteristics over the entire spatial extend thereof and thus the working range of the system. Preferably, each planar laser illumination beam component is focused so that the minimum beam width thereof occurs at a point or plane which is the farthest or maximum object distance at which the system is designed to acquire images, thereby compensating for decreases in the power density of the incident planar laser illumination beam due to the fact that the width of the planar laser illumination beam increases in length for increasing object distances away from the imaging optics. Advanced high-resolution wavefront control methods and devices are disclosed for use with the PLIIM-based systems in order to reduce the power of speckle-noise patterns observed at the image detections thereof. By virtue of the present invention, it is now possible to use both VLDs and high-speed CCD-type image detectors in conveyor, hand-held and hold-under type imaging applications alike, enjoying the advantages and benefits that each such technology has to offer, while avoiding the shortcomings and drawbacks hitherto associated therewith.

   Methods of and systems for illuminating objects using planar laser illumination beams having substantially-planar spatial distribution characteristics that extend through the field of view (FOV) of image formation and detection modules employed in such systems. Each planar laser illumination beam is produced from a planar laser illumination beam array (PLIA) comprising an plurality of planar laser illumination modules (PLIMs). Each PLIM comprises a visible laser diode (VLD, a focusing lens, and a cylindrical optical element arranged therewith. The individual planar laser illumination beam components produced from each PLIM are optically combined to produce a composite substantially planar laser illumination beam having substantially uniform power density characteristics over the entire spatial extend thereof and thus the working range of the system. Preferably, each planar laser illumination beam component is focused so that the minimum beam width thereof occurs at a point or plane which is the farthest or maximum object distance at which the system is designed to acquire images, thereby compensating for decreases in the power density of the incident planar laser illumination beam due to the fact that the width of the planar laser illumination beam increases in length for increasing object distances away from the imaging optics.

The system includes a tunnel configuration arranged about a conveyor structure for transporting objects therethrough, and an image capturing and processing subsystem embodied within the tunnel configuration, for generating a 3D digital imaging volume above the conveyor structure and within the tunnel configuration, for capturing digital 1D images of objects transported through the 3D imaging volume. The image capturing and processing subsystem includes a plurality of coplanar illumination and imaging stations. Each station includes a linear imaging array having optics providing a field of view (FOV) on the linear imaging array that is projected and extends into the 3D imaging volume, and one or more light emitting devices configured together to produce a substantially planar illumination beam (PLIB) that extends in substantially along the same plane as the FOV of the linear imaging array so that each the linear imaging array and corresponding one or more light emitting devices produce at least one coplanar illumination and imaging plane that projects into the 3D imaging volume.
