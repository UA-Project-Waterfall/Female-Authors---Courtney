   A bone graft device adapted to be received in an implant site in a patient, including, for example without limitation, an anterior spinal resection of one or more vertebrae of a spinal column of the patient. The bone graft implant site can be defined as a resection formed in any damaged or injured bone tissue, which can be, for further example, the spinal column resection that is formed between an inferior vertebral surface that confronts a superior vertebral surface where between one or more vertebral bodies and or vertebral discs or portions thereof have been removed to establish the implant site. The bone graft device includes a plurality of pseudo-vertebrae that are each formed with a transverse cross-sectional profile sized for implant in the anterior spinal resection. The pseudo vertebrae can be wedge-shaped and are stacked on at least one stanchion that can be centrally positioned or spaced apart. At least one of the plurality of pseudo-vertebrae defines an exteriorly facing sill that is adapted to be frictionally confronting and received against at least one of the inferior and superior vertebral surfaces to maximize frictional contact between the sill and at least one of the surfaces. Each pseudo-vertebral sill is sized and shaped to be equal to or smaller than the cross-section of the vertebral bodies defining the superior and inferior vertebral body surfaces so as to not invade the vertebral channel of the spinal column when the bone graft device is introduced into and received in the resection.

A current winning thread is selected from the second group of threads using a high granularity selection scheme. An instruction is fetched from a memory based on a fetch address for a next instruction of the current winning thread. The instruction is then dispatched to one of the execution units for execution, whereby execution stalls of the execution units are reduced by fetching instructions based on the low granularity and high granularity selection schemes.",ERICSSON TELEFON AB L M,GEWIRTZ EVAN;;HATHAWAY ROBERT;;MEIER STEPHAN;;HO EDWARD,TELEFONAKTIEBOLAGET L M ERICSSON (PUBL) A CORPORATION OF SWEDEN (2010-03-22),https://lens.org/008-886-531-346-091,Patent Application,yes,11,14,4,4,0,G06F9/3802;;G06F9/3851;;G06F9/3851;;G06F9/3802,G06F9/312;;G06F9/30,712/205;;712/214;;712/216;;X712E09028;;X712E09033,1,1,111-207-670-000-134,10.1145/232973.232993,"Tullsen, ""Explointing Choice: Instruction Fetch and Issue on an Implementable Simultaneous Multithreading Processor"", 22 May 1996, ACM/IEEE, Proceedings of the 23Rd Annual Symposium on Computer Architecture, pages 191-202",DISCONTINUED
