Feb. 25. Scoring and marking.-Relates to a device for indicating the number of games played on a billiard table and also the amount that is to be paid by the players. A ratchet-wheel a is engaged by a pawl b pivoted on an arm c, which is mounted on the spindle d of the ratchet-wheel. The arm c is connected by a link e to a lever f, which projects through a slot h<1> in the casing and is operated by a key k. Each time the lever f is depressed, the ratchet-wheel a is turned through the space of one tooth, and a pointer l secured to the spindle d turns through one division of a scale over which it moves. A spring S raises the lever when it is released from the key, and a pawl n prevents backward rotation of the wheel a. A second ratchet-wheel a' is secured to a hollow spindle d<1> surrounding the spindle d, and is operated by means similar to those which operate the wheel a. This spindle has also attached to it a pointer l<1> moving over the same dial as the pointer l, but pointing to a different set of graduations. A spring o is secured at one end to the casing and at the other end to the spindle d'. A sliding rod q has projections q<2>, q<3> which, when the rod is pressed inward against the action of a spring q<1>, encounter projections b<2>, b<3> respectively and lift the corresponding pawls out of engagement with the teeth of the wheel a, which returns to the zero position by the action of the spring o. The graduations over which the pointer l<1> moves represent money values, and indicate the amount payable by a person who has played a number of games. A bell A is struck by a hammer when the lever f is depressed, and a punch or stamp E for impressing a ticket may also be provided. A "" veeder "" or other counter D, operated by a,ratchet pawl and a link D<2>, records independently the number of times the lever f has been depressed.",COLE JOHN CALVIN,COLE JOHN CALVIN,,https://lens.org/078-074-840-309-740,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

    A method for relieving pressure in a vulcanized tire while still in a tire press is disclosed, wherein the bladder securement mechanism utilizes a position sensor mechanism and eliminates the need for spacers and a floating piston. A tire press comprises a lower mold, an upper mold, and a bladder securement mechanism. The bladder securement mechanism has an upper clamping mechanism for securing the upper periphery of a bladder and a lower clamping mechanism for securing the lower periphery of the bladder. A center mechanism tube has a center mechanism rod positioned therein. A piston is disposed within the center mechanism tube. The piston provides reciprocating motion to the center mechanism rod. A position sensor mechanism operatively associated with the bladder securement mechanism. The method comprises the steps of positioning a green tire on the bottom mold; lowering the upper clamping mechanism; inflating the bladder, thereby forming a seal between the bladder and the tire; closing the press so that the green tire is enclosed within the upper and lower molds; curing the green tire; breaking the seal by moving the upper clamping mechanism downward toward the lower clamping mechanism; releasing pressure from the tire; and, dissipating the released pressure. Depending on the configuration of the tire press, the lower clamping mechanism may be moved to strip the bladder from the tire.

   A method of utilizing an adjustable height bladder securement mechanism to effect advantageous bladder movement during a loading and shaping process is disclosed. A tire press comprises a lower mold, an upper mold, and a center mechanism. The center mechanism has an upper clamping mechanism for securing the upper periphery of a bladder and a lower clamping mechanism for securing the lower periphery of the bladder. A center mechanism tube has a center rod positioned therein. A piston is disposed within the center mechanism tube. The piston provides reciprocating motion to the center rod. A position sensor mechanism is operatively associated with the center mechanism. The method comprises the steps of establishing a first baseline height by first applying a set force to the center rod of the bladder securement mechanism to determine the stretch of the bladder; repeatedly curing tires with said bladder up to a certain number of cures; establishing a successive baseline height; and, comparing the first and successive baseline heights and if the difference is less than a predetermined stretch height tolerance, continuing curing tires. If the difference between the first and successive baseline heights is outside of an acceptable stretch tolerance, the bladder must be corrected, either through replacement or by adjusting the height that the center rod reaches during the loading process.

The flexure axis divides the sensing element into first (66) and second (68) sections. The total moments of the first and second sections about the flexure axis are different, such that acceleration normal to the substrate tends to rotate the sensing element about the flexure axis. A first electrode (74) is mounted by the substrate adjacent the first section to form a first capacitor (C.sub.A), and a second electrode (76) is mounted by the substrate adjacent the second section to form a second capacitor (C.sub.B). A detector for measuring the relative capacitances of the first and second capacitors is provided comprising an integrator (166), an inverting amplifier (168), and switches (160, 162, 164) for periodically charging and discharging the capacitors in response to a clock signal. In one embodiment, the sensing element includes an internal opening (16, 56, 126) and the mounting system is positioned within the opening and includes a pedestal mounted to the substrate, and torsion bars (20, 22, 118, 120) and/or a beam (60, 114) connecting the pedestal to the sensing element. The sensing element preferably comprises a metallic plate, and the substrate preferably comprises a semiconductor upon which the detector and electrodes are fabricated in a single step process requiring no final assembly of components. In an embodiment adapted for high g applications, a pedestal (146) divides a plate member into first (148) and second (150) cantilevered beams that flex in the same direction in response to a given acceleration.",SILICON DESIGNS INC,COLE JOHN C,SILICON DESIGNS INC (1985-12-18),https://lens.org/199-496-086-511-302,Granted Patent,yes,13,255,1,1,0,G01P15/0802;;G01P15/125;;G01P2015/0828;;G01P2015/0831;;G01P15/0802;;G01P15/125;;G01P2015/0828;;G01P2015/0831,G01P15/08;;G01P15/125,73517R;;73/514;;X324 60C;;X324 61R,1,0,,,"Corey, Multi Axis Clusters of Single Axis Accelerometers with Coincident Centers of Angular Motion Insensitivity , presented at the 6th International Aerospace Symposium, Bedford, England, Mar. 23 26, 1970.",EXPIRED

Kemsley, J. C. Nov. 8. Advertising.- Relates to means for controlling, by means of a fly controlled by a clock, the intermittent motion of a circular platform carrying a number of advertisements or the like, and for stopping the said motion for a longer time, for instance, at night, without stopping the controlling- clock. The platform c carries the advertisements, which are successively brought under openings d in a table top a, the openings being covered by plate-glass panes e. A spring in a barrel f drives, by means of gearing h, i, j, k, the spindle g on which the platform c is mounted. The rotation of the spindle g is controlled through wheels l, m by a fly n, which is alternately stopped and released by means of a lever o. Instead of the gearwheels l, m, gearing may be arranged between the fly spindle and the periphery of the platform c. The lever o is slowly moved in the direction of the arrow 3 by means of links s, r, and a dog or pawl r<1>, which engages, and is moved by, a ratchet-wheel q on the hour spindle of a clock p ; it is rapidly returned by a spring t. A finger u on the lever o moves in the path of lugs v, w adjustably mounted on the arms of the fly n. When the dog r<1> is at the bottom of a tooth, the finger u stops the lug v, Fig. 3. When the dog r' is at the middle of a tooth, the finger u clears the lug v, which then flies past the finger u on the side towards the arrow 4, until the lug w is stopped by the finger u. The fly is then stopped until the dog r<1> is again at the bottom of a tooth, when the lug w escapes, passing the finger u on the side towards the arrow 3. Thus the finger u releases one lug only when it is in a position to stop the next. A camdisk x, which revolves once in twenty-four hours, acts through a rod z on the link r, thus holding the dog r<1> clear of the wheel q for a predetermined time, during which the finger u stops the lug w, and therefore the platform c. The hub 6 of the platform c may slide freely on the square end 7 of the spindle g, the weight of the platform being supported by balls 8 in ball races 9. The fly n may have more than two arms, each carrying an adjustable lug. The advertisements may be illuminated by suitable means, or luminous paint may be employed. A clock dial may be sunk in the table top.",KEMSLEY JOHN COLE,KEMSLEY JOHN COLE,,https://lens.org/091-171-409-058-02X,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Metal oxide silicon transistors (MOSTs) are used for selecting column and/or row lines of a magnetic storage matrix using either ferrite cores or cylindrical anisotropic thin films. A word-organized thin film store is shown comprising a plurality of sub-matrices, the digits of a word being stored singly in corresponding positions such as A, B, in respective submatrices. To write a word in a selected column a switch H1-H4, which may optionally be a MOST, is closed and enables a pulse I w from a source 8 to switch the storage elements in the column towards the hard direction of magnetization. A single row in each submatrix is selected by appropriately energizing a MOST in each of the submatrix groups M1-M4, M5-M8, the gate electrodes of MOSTs in corresponding rows of the submatrices being commoned. Each digit is characterized by the potential of a pulse I b applied from a respective pulse source 6, 7, the pulses determining the direction along the easy axis which the magnetization of each film takes up when the column and row pulses I w , I b terminate. For non-destructive read-out a pulse is applied to a selected column line and one MOST M1-M4, M5-M8 of each submatrix made conductive, the digit voltages induced in the row conductors being detected by sense amplifiers 9, 10. The row line MOSTs are biased so as to carry current in either direction when conductive.",PLESSEY CO LTD,COLE ALUN JOHN,,https://lens.org/033-578-455-989-248,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G11C11/04,G11C11/04,H3B B200          AD;;H3B B200          AE;;H3B B202          AD;;H3B B202          AE;;H3B B208          AD;;H3B B208          AE;;H3B B210          AD;;H3B B210          AE;;H3B B211          AD;;H3B B211          AE;;H3B B212          AD;;H3B B212          AE;;H3B B213          AD;;H3B B213          AE;;H3B B236          AD;;H3B B236          AE;;H3B B237          AD;;H3B B237          AE;;H3B B270          AD;;H3B B270          AE;;H3B B271          AD;;H3B B271          AE;;H3B B277          AD;;H3B B277          AE;;H3B B300          AD;;H3B B300          AE;;H3B B325          AD;;H3B B325          AE;;H3B B326          AD;;H3B B326          AE;;H3B B350          AD;;H3B B350          AE;;H3B B404          AD;;H3B B404          AE;;H3B B413          AD;;H3B B413          AE;;H3B B420          AD;;H3B B420          AE;;H3B B488          AD;;H3B B488          AE;;H3B B490          AD;;H3B B490          AE;;H3B B501          AD;;H3B B501          AE;;H3X X5A           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Cole, J. H. Jan. 30. Games imitating croquet and billiards.-A game imitating croquet and billiards is played by means of cues or mallets on a dining or billiard table. When it is played on a dining-table, the table is covered with a cloth, which is kept taut by means of strips l, Fig. 1, of wood forming the boundaries of the table m. These strips are secured to the table by means of wooden clamps k and wedges n, and they are provided with elastic cushions secured by means of rubber solution. , When a billiard table is used, the wooden strips may be used to cover the cushions and pockets of the table. To prevent displacement of the hoops c, Fig. 2, when struck, they are made of a heavy metal; and are cast integral with or leaded into sockets of lead d<1>, the feet of which are covered with rubber or emery or other cloth a. The arches of the hoops are provided with cork cushions d for receiving pins e carrying flags, in order to mark the progress of the game. The pillars, which have to be struck by the balls after passing through the hoops, take the form of a model lighthouse and Irish roundtower, respectively, and each is marked with coloured bands to indicate the order of play. The hoops and pillars are provided with horizontal rings or collars of rubber b, against which the balls can strike and rebound.",COLE JOHN HARDING,COLE JOHN HARDING,,https://lens.org/187-896-399-646-192,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The determined count may be an ""all zeroes"" condition. Preferably the identifiable combinations are all similar and correspond to a traffic idle signal having the same number of bits as an intelligence character and the means for resetting the counter may comprise a store register having as many stages as bits in one of combinations. A receiver of known type 1 includes main processor 2 receiving clock signals at bit rate from divider 6 also at character rate through a division counter 8; in the embodiment the division ratio n = 10. To synchronize counter 8, received signals are also fed to n = 10 bit register 13 stepping of which is also controlled by divider 6. On receipt of a predetermined bit combination, e.g. a traffic idle signal, detector 14 changes its output to lead 15D and through normally conductive gate 16 to offset three stage counter 17, assumed initially at 00 which gives an output on lead 20 which closes gate 16. Signals on lead 15D also open gate 21 hence signals from division counter 22 move counter 17 forwards. Counter 22 is fed at bit rate through gate 23 also opened when counter 17 is offset. When detector 14 is not detecting a signal, lead 15F is energized hence opens gate 25 hence admitting reverse count signals from counter 22. At full count a signal on lead 26 resets counter 8 to zero. In operation when the first of a plurality of successive idle characters appear in register 13 a signal on line 15D offsets counter 17 which gives a signal on line 20 closing gate 16 and opening gate 23. The signal on lead 15D also opens gate 21. If the next idle signal is detected by 14 at the correct time, gate 21 will pass one forward count to counter 17. If the next idle signal is not detected gate 25 will be open hence counter 17 will receive a reverse count. When counter 17 is full i.e. when the required number of idle characters had been correctly detected, counter 8 is reset in one step to the ""all zeroes"" condition by a signal over lead 26.",MARCONI CO LTD,COLE EDRIC JOHN OSBORN,,https://lens.org/118-126-464-389-062,Granted Patent,no,0,0,6,6,0,H04L7/042,H04L7/04,H4P PB1           PS1&;;H4P PB2           PS1&;;H4P PB6A          PS1&;;H4P PN5           PS1&;;H4P PSB           PSB;;H4P PSN           PSB;;H4P PS1           PS1&,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

This mechanism controls the rotational direction and speed of the shaft 20, which carries worms 17 in gear with right and left handed wormwheels 16 secured to two cross-shafts 10.

The driving- shaft 30, Figs. 4 and 5, drives the longitudinal shaft 20 through a bevel-gear 36, 37 and a short shaft 35 carrying two loose spur-wheels 38, 39, between which a clutch 40 slides on a feather-key. According to which of these two wheels is engaged by the clutch 40, the longitudinal shaft 20 is driven quickly through the spur-wheel 25 in engagement with the second 39 of the two loose wheels, or slowly in the opposite sense from the first loose wheel 38 through change-wheels 41, 45. The clutch 40 is thrown into gear with either of its coacting wheels 38, 39 by the fall of a weighted lever 50, the lower end 53 of which has a slot 54 through which passes a pin 55 secured to a forked or rounded piece 56, fitting a recess 57 in the clutch and capable of sliding on a short shaft 58. Through a slot 60 in the upper arm of the lever 50 passes a rod 61, having an adjustable collar 62, 63 on each side of the lever and its ends fastened to the ends of a chain 64 passing over a sprocket-wheel 65 on the nearer cross-shaft 10 and over a guide-wheel 66. When either collar contacts with the lever, it throws the lever over from one side to the other. Mechanism for allowing the false bottom 2 to dwell at the bottom of the vat 5 comprises a vertical rod 68 adjustably secured to an horizontal plate 69 pivoted at 70<a> to a bracket 70, itself secured to a vertically-sliding feathered rod 71. The clutch 40 carries a collar 80, which when the clutch is thrown out of gear with the quick-drive loose spur-wheels 39, contacts with the vertical rod 68. This forces the other end 72 of the plate 69, suitably shaped for the purpose, into contact with a constantly rotating buttress thread 73, against the tension of a spring 81. Accordingly the buttress thread raises the bracket 70 and other parts attached thereto, including the vertical rod 68, until the lower end of the latter is lifted out of the way of the collar 80, whereupon the clutch 40 is thrown into gear with the slow-drive loose spur-wheel 38, the false bottom 2 being thus slowly raised. During this motion the vertical rod 68 rests on the periphery of the collar 80, and falls again when the clutch is again thrown into gear with the quick-motion spur-wheel 39, a counterweight and the necessary fittings being provided to prevent sho:k.",KERSHAW JOE;;COLE JOHN THOMAS,KERSHAW JOE;;COLE JOHN THOMAS,,https://lens.org/125-998-464-056-825,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

KLINGER MFG. CO. Ltd. 25 Oct., 1965, No. 45043/65. Heading D1C. An out-turned welt is knitted on a circular machine in a manner similar to that described in specification 1084281 by providing sinkers with an upper 99 and lower 98 loop drawing edge, Figure 7, such that the initial set up courses F, are knitted and drawn over the upper edge 99, Figure 8, and subsequently the sinkers and needles are manipulated to enable the loops on alternate needles to be held on their stems, Figure 10, in the throats 96 of the sinkers whilst all of the needles continue to knit at the upper edge level of the sinkers to produce ,the welt. Simultaneously with the knitting of the welt an air blast is directed downwardly close to the inside of the needle circle where knitting occurs to exert draw off tension on the fabric when knitting takes place. To complete the turned welt the sinkers are withdrawn to permit the needles to draw loops over the lower edge of the sinkers through the last course of 'the welt and the loops held on the stems of The alternate needles so that these latter loops are knitted into the fabric. Knitting is then continued by drawing loops over the lower edge of the sinkers. To enable the sinkers to be withdrawn and inserted to position the loops on the stems of the alternate needles and to enable knitting to be carried out at both upper and lower edge levels of the sinkers, adjustable sinker cams 55, 60, Figure 4, not shown, are provided and are operated as required from the cam drum of the machine. Simultaneously to alter the draw of the needles to correspond to the loop drawing edges of the sinkers the stitch cams 37, 38 Fig. 3, not shown, are vertically adjustably controlled by linkwork from the cam drum. After the production of the set up courses and when the loops have been drawn down by the alternate needles to engage them in the throats 96 of the sinkers a movable central lifting cam 47 raises the alternate needles to ensure that they take yarn into their hooks without knitting it. Subsequently all of the needles take yarn and knit for the completion of the welt.",KLINGER MFG CO LTD,REYMES-COLE JOHN MAURICE REYME,,https://lens.org/173-313-897-862-036,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,D04B9/54,D04B9/54,D1C C1A5          -;;D1C C1H10A        -;;D1C C1H10C        -;;D1C C1H12E        -;;D1C C1H15A        -;;D1C C1H15C        -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Passing fluids through materials.-A dyeing or like apparatus of the kind described in Specification 16329/08, wherein material is alternately compressed and allowed to expand between a movable perforated bottom and a fixed lattice top, is provided with a circulating pump arrangement for passing liquid through the material in either direction, a spraying-device, modified means for operating the movable bottom, means for raising the lattice top, and an attachment for treating materials in hank form. A spraying-device comprising horizontal pipes 16 and a perforated shallow tank is arranged above the lattice top 10 of the vat, and is supplied with liquid from a telescopic pipe 18 connected to a circulating system through a three-way valve 29. The circulating system comprises a pump 22 communicating on its suction side with the bottom of the tank through pipes 23, 24, a three-way valve 25 being interposed in the pipe 23 with a side pipe 26 connecting to a storage tank. A pipe 21a from the outlet of the pump connects to the spraying-device through the valve 29, at which is a connexion 28 to the upper side of the storage tank. A pipe 30 extends from a three-way valve 27 to the pipe 23, and a pipe 35 with a valve 36 from a three-way valve 37 in the pipe 23 to the pipe 21<a>. Side pipes 31 connected to the tank at 33 are connected to the pipe 35. By regulating the various valves, liquid may be circulated through the tanks in different manners without reversing the pump. The bottom grid 4 is supported by a frame 6, which is lifted by chains &c. 9 connected to drums 53<a> on a shaft 53, which is driven so as to raise and lower the grid alternately. The mechanism for producing this effect comprises a driven cross shaft 40 rotated by two sets of fast and loose pulleys 44, 45, which are driven at different speeds and in different directions by belts moved on to their respectively pulleys by slides 44<a> and 45<a> mounted on a slide 46. The slide 46 is operated by a lever 47 pivoted thereto and mounted on a rocking shaft 48, which is provided with a hand-lever 51, by the movement of which either of the fast pulleys 44, 45 may be connected to the power source, the belt of the other set of pulleys running on a loose pulley. In a central position of the lever defined by a locking- pin engaging a hole 52, both sets of gearing will be engaged with loose pulleys. The shaft 40 drives the shaft 53 by pinions 61, 60 and worm gearing 58, 55. A chain 66 runs over a pulley 63 on the shaft 53 and a guide-pulley 64, and serves for automatically reversing the motion of the grid 4. A lever 67 is mounted on the rocking shaft 48 and is connected to a slotted link 70 pivoted to an arm 71 of a three-armed lever mounted on a shaft 72, the other arms of which are provided with a tumbler weight 74 and a balance weight 76 respectively. A hand-lever 77 is mounted on the shaft 72 having a projecting fork 78, which embraces the chain 66 and is engaged by stops 80 thereon to throw the levers 71. 47 from one side to the other as the chain moves up or down and thereby reverse the motion of the grid 4. The lattice top 10 is raised by chains &c. 87 passing over pulleys 88 and wound on a ratchet-controlled shaft 85.

The silane triflate can be H x Si(OSO 2 CF 3 ) 4-x or H x Si(OSO 2 C 4 F 9 ) 4-x . The method can be used to synthesize trisilane, (H 3 Si) 2 SiH 2 , and the iso-tetrasilane analog, (H 3 Si) 3 SiH, by combining a silane triflate with a compound comprising a SiH 3 ligand under conditions whereby the silicon hydride is formed. The silane triflate can include H x Si(OSO 2 CF 3 ) 4-x or H x Si(OSO 2 C 4 F 9 ) 4-x wherein x=1 or 2. A method for synthesizing (H 3 Ge) 2 SiH 2 includes combining H 3 GeSiH 2 (OSO 2 CF 3 ) with KGeH 3 under conditions whereby (H 3 Ge) 2 SiH 2 is formed.",KOUVETAKIS JOHN;;RITTER COLE J;;TOLLE JOHN;;UNIV ARIZONA,KOUVETAKIS JOHN;;RITTER COLE J;;TOLLE JOHN,,https://lens.org/139-855-143-403-435,Granted Patent,yes,8,0,10,29,0,C01B6/06;;C01B33/04;;Y10S148/058;;C01B33/04;;C01B6/06;;Y10S148/058,C01B33/00,423/324;;423/644;;117/939,41,21,020-746-248-810-784;;061-907-752-937-444;;012-673-685-879-486;;010-378-991-774-661;;033-089-710-177-419;;093-778-087-029-536;;057-834-435-536-445;;006-469-547-790-568;;121-124-793-480-261;;074-848-449-780-880;;146-777-721-783-568;;154-070-947-955-634;;035-657-164-155-399;;078-977-800-052-335;;002-721-935-973-979;;137-096-894-798-813;;110-548-850-753-992;;023-549-989-519-026;;033-127-953-862-167;;135-350-827-696-698;;030-517-908-347-398,10.1021/ja00102a052;;10.1002/cber.1491271104;;10.1021/ja060428j;;16719472;;10.1002/cber.19911241105;;10.1146/annurev.matsci.30.1.335;;10.1146/annurev.matsci.30.1.431;;10.1038/nature04204;;16251959;;10.1109/55.215149;;10.1063/1.1590052;;10.1063/1.106246;;10.1063/1.114349;;10.1063/1.119132;;10.1063/1.121162;;10.1063/1.104783;;10.1021/ja051411o;;15998091;;10.1063/1.2117620;;10.1016/s0021-8502(03)00029-6;;10.1021/jp9537318;;10.1021/cm034477w;;10.1063/1.1606104;;10.1016/s0040-6090(00)00660-x,"Apeloig et al.

[Also in Group VIII] The heel of a stocking is formed by continuous rotary knitting on a circular knitting machine, using a thermoplastic yarn such as nylon, the heel then being stretched on a form and submitted to heat so that it assumes the desired shape in which it sets upon the fabric cooling. Some shaping is achieved in the knitting of the heel by periodically removing the instep needles from operation and by varying the loop length in the heel portion. If desired, only the heel part is knitted of thermoplastic yarn, the foot and leg being knitted of natural or artificial silk or lisle.

Knitting. KENDALL CO. Dec. 31, 1951 [Nov. 6, 1950], No. 27009/50. Class 74 (2). To produce a stocking toe in knitting from the toe upwards on a circular machine, initially inactive spaced toe fashioning needles, over at least one arc 16 of the circle, are progressively introduced at each side of a medial point in the arc, during circular knitting, to begin new wales. Surplus fabric 14 is then trimmed away and the edges joined by linking or seaming. As shown, equally-spaced (e.g. alternate) needles and sinkers throughout the entire circle are inactive during the knitting of a few courses 11. A small group of such needles in those instep needles which knit the centre of the toe are then introduced, with their sinkers. Thereafter, at intervals of a few courses, further pairs of groups are introduced, one on each side of the activated needles until all fashioning needles 16 are knitting. Rows of fashioning holes T<SP>1</SP>, T<SP>2</SP>, T<SP>3</SP>, T<SP>4</SP>, T<SP>5</SP> are thus produced. The toe may be of a comparatively stout thread or of real or artificial silk or nylon plus a splicing thread. Loop size may be evened up as in Specification 723,301. Toe fashioning needles may be introduced over two opposed arcs, corresponding to foot top and bottom, surplus fabric being cut-away at the sides. The foot may be fashioned by needles devoted to that purpose. The heel is produced by rotary knitting, heel fashioning needles and their sinkers being periodically introduced starting from the outer or inner ends of the group 18, 18<SP>1</SP> thereof, to produce upwardly-convergent or divergent lines 25 of fashioning holes; in the latter case, a splicing thread, fed to needles producing the foot bottom, may be fed to the heel needles, so that at the heel the edges of the spliced areas coincide with the fashioning line whilst, above the heel, the splicing thread may be continued to form a high splice. The heel pouch may be accentuated by periodically restraining the instep needles from knitting during one revolution, the yarn floats being subsequently cut out, or eliminated by trapping and cutting mechanism as in Specifications 532,520, 532,586 or 570,810. The heel may be knitted by reciprocation, in the normal manner. The leg is fashioned by progressive introduction of leg fashioning needles 19, 19<SP>1</SP> and their sinkers, the introduction beginning at either end of the groups, to produce upwardly convergent or divergent lines 22 of fashioning holes. The thigh may be fashioned, immediately below the welt, by progressive introduction of groups 20, 201 of fashioning needles. If desired, all sinkers may be active at the beginning of the toe, the resulting visual contrast between the two qualities of fabric thus produced being eliminated before production of that part of the stocking leg normally above the shoe (e.g. at the start of the heel) by withdrawing from activity the sinkers associated with the leg fashioning needles and introducing them as the associated needles are introduced.",KENDALL & CO,REYMES-COLE BERNARD THORNTON R;;REYMES-COLE DAVID NORMAN REYME;;REYMES-COLE JOHN MAURICE REYME,,https://lens.org/199-699-298-920-124,Granted Patent,no,0,6,1,1,0,D04B1/108;;D04B1/26;;D04B9/56,D04B9/46,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The top end of each pressure pipe is connectable with a common pressurizing gas supply (9) and the bottom end incorporates a fluid level sensor head (3). The following steps are carried out for each pipe: 
- connecting said pipe with the common gas supply, 
- conducting the pressurizing gas into said pipe thereby forcing the fluid downward into said fluid level sensor head, comprising a lower end part in which the fluid passes an outlet opening forming an abrupt transition between said lower end part and an open ended tube, 
- determining a level indicating signal from the passing fluid, 
- determining a pressure indicating signal from the pressure on the fluid, and 
- deriving from said level and pressure indicating signals information on the said vertical density profile.

Supply systems for railway vehicle services. J. STONE & CO. (DEPTFORD) Ltd. May 9, 1962 [July 18, 1961], No. 26047/61. Class 38 (4). An electrical supply system comprising a variable-speed alternator has the excitation of the alternator so arranged that the current delivered by the alternator remains substantially constant over a wide range of speed. The alternator 3 is provided with main and auxiliary field windings 4, 5 wound in an additive sense, the main winding 4 being excited in accordance with the load 1 on the alternator, the auxiliary winding 5 being excited in inverse proportion to the output frequency of the alternator by way of a frequency-sensitive circuit 6, the choke 9 of which saturates at high frequencies. The excitation of the auxiliary winding 5 is thus greater at low frequencies so that the full output of the alternator 3 is developed at very low speeds. The alternator is preferably a high-frequency unsaturated machine. The system may incorporate a variable resistor whereby the output level of the alternator may be adjusted.",STONE J & CO LTD,HOBBS EDWIN DANIEL;;COLE PETER JOHN,,https://lens.org/166-047-176-633-88X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,5,5,0,B60L9/26;;H02J7/16;;B60L2200/26;;H02J7/16;;B60L9/26;;B60L2200/26,B60L9/26;;H02J7/16,H2H HBCB          BCB;;H2H H25Y          BCB,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
