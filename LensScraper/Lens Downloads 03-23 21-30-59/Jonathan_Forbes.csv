The technique makes use of ancillary files that are stored along with the data files. The ancillary files include lookup tables and indexes. A lookup table for a data file indicates the position of the last occurrence of individual data values within the data file. Each displacement index for a data file indicates displacements from respective data elements to prior strings of a particular match length that match strings of the particular match length begun by the respective data elements. Indexes corresponding to different match lengths are provided. In response to client requests for subsets of available data files, a server compresses each subset of data files using a pattern-matching compression scheme that attempts to represent given strings by referencing prior matching strings across file boundaries. To find a prior matching string for a string begun by a current data element in a current data file, the server finds a previous matching string in the current data file by referencing the displacement indexes associated with the current data file, and then searches for a larger matching string in previous data files by referencing the lookup tables and displacement indexes associated with the previous data files.",MICROSOFT CORP,FORBES JONATHAN,MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (1998-06-23),https://lens.org/128-174-653-015-093,Granted Patent,yes,8,44,1,1,0,H03M7/3084;;G06F16/9017;;H03M7/3084;;Y10S707/99932;;Y10S707/99942;;Y10S707/99936;;Y10S707/918;;Y10S707/99931;;G06F16/9017,G06F17/30;;H03M7/30,707/1;;707/2;;707/6;;707/101,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The method includes a step of sequentially examining data elements and strings of data elements of the data input stream in a first compression pass using a sliding window compression scheme to find literal data elements and pairs of length and displacement values. The first compression pass includes: coding the literal data elements and the length values with a first minimum redundancy coding tree; coding the displacement values with a second minimum redundancy coding tree; and adding the coded literal data elements, length values, and displacement values to a single data buffer.

It provides an opportunity for anyone to apply a mixture of ONIONS, COCONUT OIL, SUBTLE ENERGY AND WATER to any part of the head, in order to grow hair. The ingredients are prepared by cutting the onion into small portions, and then combined with subtle energy. The method I use is to simply print energy that I capture with my camera. The onion and subtle energy is then put in a container and soaked with water. The mixture is then put into a microwave for 10 minutes (I turn it over after 5 minutes) and then the coconut oil is added to the mixture.

A novel binary tree is created by a search engine in which the nodes associated with strings in the data stream which are closer to the current data stream position are nearer the root of the tree than nodes associated with strings which are farther. As the current position in the stream is advanced, the search engine inserts a new node to the tree for that position as the root node. The tree is then restructured based on the relative value of the strings of each node while preserving the temporal order of the tree such that strings nearer the current position are associated with nodes which are closer to the root.

    The present invention provides a method of identifying an agent useful in treating Crohn's disease. This method is practiced by culturing P. fluorescens under conditions that support growth; contacting the P. fluorescens with an agent; and assaying for reduced growth or viability of the P. fluorescens as compared to the growth or viability in the absence of the agent, where the reduced growth or viability of the P. fluorescens indicates that the agent is an anti- P. fluorescens agent useful in treating Crohn's disease. Also provided by the invention is a method of preventing or treating Crohn's disease in an individual by administering to the individual an effective dose of an anti- Pseudomonas vaccine.

This method is practiced by culturing P. fluorescens under conditions that support growth; contacting the P. fluorescens with an agent; and assaying for reduced growth or viability of the P. fluorescens as compared to the growth or viability in the absence of the agent, where the reduced growth or viability of the P. fluorescens indicates that the agent is an anti- P. fluorescens agent useful in treating Crohn's disease. Also provided by the invention is a method of preventing or treating Crohn's disease in an individual by administering to the individual an effective dose of an anti-Pseudomonas vaccine.

A compressor is pre-initialized in accordance with the old version of the file (e.g. in an LZ77 compressor, the history window is pre-loaded with the file). The pre-initialized compressor then compresses the old file, producing a patch file from which the new file can be generated, as a single process. At the user's computer, a parallel process is performed, with the user's copy of the old file being used to pre-initialize a decompressor to which the patch file is then input.

A compressor is pre-initialized in accordance with the old version of the file (e.g. in an LZ77 compressor, the history window is pre-loaded with the file). The pre-initialized compressor then compresses the new file, producing a patch file from which the new file can be generated. At the user's computer, a parallel process is performed, with the user's copy of the old file being used to pre-initialize a decompressor to which the patch file is then input. The output of the decompressor is the new file. The patch files generated and used in these processes are of significantly reduced size when compared to the prior art. Variations between copies of the old file as installed on different computers are also addressed, so that a single patch file can be applied irrespective of such variations. By so doing, the need for a multi-version patch file to handle such installation differences is eliminated, further reducing the size of the patch file when compared with prior art techniques. Such variations are addressed by “normalizing” the old file prior to application of the patch file.

    Rather than comparing an old file with a new file to generate a set of patching instructions, and then compressing the patching instructions to generate a compact patch file for transmission to a user, a patch file is generated in a single operation. A compressor is pre-initialized in accordance with the old version of the file (e.g. in an LZ77 compressor, the history window is pre-loaded with the file), or other reference file available on the user's computer for purpose other than serving as a decompression aid. The pre-initialized compressor then compresses the old file, producing a patch file from which the new file can be generated. At the user's computer, a parallel process is performed, with the user's copy of the old file being used to pre-initialize a decompressor to which the patch file is then input. The output of the decompressor is the new file. The patch files generated and used in these processes are of significantly reduced size when compared to the prior art.

In one embodiment, a plurality of datasets within a data stream is received. The data stream is partitioned based on efficient query processing. Once the data stream is partitioned, an affinity identifier is assigned to datasets based on the partitioning of the dataset. Further, when datasets are broken into extents, the affinity identifier of the parent dataset is retained in the resulting extent. The affinity identifier of each extent is then referenced to preferentially store extents having common affinity identifiers within close proximity of one other across a data center.",ZHOU JINGREN;;HELLAND PATRICK JAMES;;FORBES JONATHAN;;BURD YARON;;MICROSOFT CORP,ZHOU JINGREN;;HELLAND PATRICK JAMES;;FORBES JONATHAN;;BURD YARON,MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (2010-10-14),https://lens.org/042-711-858-378-018,Patent Application,yes,12,3,2,2,0,G06F16/90339;;G06F16/90339,G06F17/30,707/737;;707/755;;X707E17089,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The system facilitates incremental re-crawls and/or selective updating of information (e.g., documents) using a structure called a chunk to simplify the process of an incremental crawl. A chunk is a set of documents that can be manipulated as a set (e.g., of up to 65,536 (64K) documents). “Document” refers to a corpus of data that is stored at a particular URL (e.g., HTML, PDF, PS, PPT, XLS, and/or DOC Files etc.) A chunk is created by an indexer. The indexer can place into a chunk documents that have similar property(ies). These property(ies) include but are not limited to: average time between change and average importance. These property(ies) can be stored at the chunk level in a chunk map.
