   A backflow prevention device for use with a conventional washing machine system that is uniquely designed to automatically disrupt the power to the washing machine should the drain line leading from the washing machine become clogged. The backflow prevention device includes an internally mounted micro switch that is operably interconnected with a portable ground fault circuit interrupter plug that is connected to a duplex outlet. The washing machine is connected to the ground fault circuit interrupter plug so that, upon being actuated, the micro switch will cause a low voltage default to be sent to the ground fault circuit interrupter which triggers it in a manner to automatically cause an interruption of power to the washing machine.

   A printing unit has a frame and a plurality of printing cylinders, including a first plate cylinder, a first blanket cylinder, a second blanket cylinder mounted in the frame and forming a nip with the first blanket cylinder for receiving a web of material to be printed, and a second plate cylinder. A plurality of eccentric boxes are mounted on the cylinders and supported in the frame. A plurality of actuation assemblies are provided that are connected to the eccentric boxes. One of the actuation assemblies is connected to each of the eccentric boxes for moving the eccentric boxes such that the printing cylinders can be selectively positioned between a thrown-off position and an engagement position in regards to adjacent printing cylinders. Because of the use of eccentric boxes, lower rated and less complicated actuation assemblies can be used.

WESTERN ELECTRIC CO. Inc. 17 June, 1965 [23 June, 1964], No. 25617/65. Heading HlK. In a device having a metal-to-semi -conductor rectifying junction, the metal layer consists of two different metals in contact with each other, both contacting a surface of the semi-conductor. The metal having the lower barrier potential defines the effective junction and the other metal provides a contact area for an electrode lead. In Fig. 1, an N-type silicon wafer 11 has been provided-eg. by vapour phase deposition through a surface oxide mask-with an annular deposit 12 of platinum which may, but need not, be alloyed to the silicon. The platinum serves as a mask for deposition of a circular layer 13 of tungsten inside the platinum annulus. An electrode lead 14 is attached, e.g. by thermocompression bonding, to the platinum and an ohmic contact 15 is made to the opposite face of the wafer, thus completing a diode in which the metal electrode connection is to the platinum, the junction effectively being that between the tungsten and the silicon. If the silicon is P-type the roles of platinum and tungsten are reversed. The invention may also be applied to germanium and gallium arsenide semi-conductors. The platinum may be replaced by gold or vanadium and the tungsten by molybdenum, silver or copper. The lower barrier metal may also be of calcium, magnesium, lithium or sodium provided that the higher barrier metal, to which the electrode lead will be attached, completely covers and protects it from the atmosphere. In Fig. 2 (not shown), a diode differing from that described above only in that the metal layers are contiguous rectangles has been converted into a metal base transistor by deposition on the metal layer constituting the effective barrier of further semi-conductor material, which need not be the same semi-conductor as the underlying wafer.",WESTERN ELECTRIC CO,CROWELL CLARENCE ROBERT;;SZE SIMON MIN,,https://lens.org/011-504-921-202-087,Granted Patent,no,0,0,4,4,0,H01L29/872;;H01L29/872;;H01L21/00;;H01L21/00;;H01L23/482;;H01L23/482;;H01L23/485;;H01L23/485;;H01L24/05;;H01L24/05;;H01L29/00;;H01L29/00;;H01L2224/04042;;H01L2224/04042;;H01L2224/05552;;H01L2224/05552;;H01L2224/4847;;H01L2224/4847;;H01L2224/49107;;H01L2224/49107;;H01L2924/12032;;H01L2924/12032,H01L21/00;;H01L23/482;;H01L23/485;;H01L29/00;;H01L29/872,H1K KHAX          HAX;;H1K K1A1          HA;;H1K K1CX          HA;;H1K K1C7M         HA;;H1K K2R3A         HA;;H1K K2R3Y         HA;;H1K K2SU1         HA;;H1K K2S1D         HA;;H1K K2S10         HA;;H1K K2S11G        HA;;H1K K2S11S        HA;;H1K K2S2D         HA;;H1K K2S20         HA;;H1K K2S22D        HA;;H1K K2S28         HA;;H1K K2S3C         HA;;H1K K2S3D         HA;;H1K K2S30         HA;;H1K K2S7B         HA;;H1K K2S7C         HA;;H1K K2S9          HA;;H1K K4C1R         HA;;H1K K4C1U         HA;;H1K K4C2A         HA;;H1K K4C2B         HA;;H1K K4C2U         HA;;H1K K4C23         HA;;H1K K4C3Y         HA;;H1K K4C5Y         HA;;H1K K4FU1         HA;;H1K K4F11G        HA;;H1K K4F11S        HA;;H1K K4F22D        HA;;H1K K4F28         HA;;H1K K4F3C         HA;;H1K K4F3D         HA;;H1K K4F30         HA;;H1K K4F7B         HA;;H1K K4F7C         HA;;H1K K4F9          HA;;H1K K8M           HA;;H1K K9M           HA;;H1K K9N2          HA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Cam 101 is movable axially only so that the position of its follower 102 is a function of compressor inlet temperature only. The follower 67 controls the pitch of the compressor stator blades through an hydraulic servomotor 71 and linkage 76. The main fuel control 11 comprises a metering valve 38 having a member 42 rotatable by bellows 45 in accordance with compressor discharge pressure, and an overlapping member 43 movable axially by means of a lever 57 which transmits the output of a differential 61. The output of the differential 61 is the difference between two inputs, one input being a manual setting transmitted by a lever 29 and gears 62 and the other input being a function of the engine rotor speed, transmitted from the governor 17 by gearing 63, 64. The upward movement of the member 43 is limited by the cam 49 and follower 48. The area of the jet propulsion nozzle is varied by means of an hydraulic servomotor 36, 96, the control rod 95 of which is actuated through levers 82-87 by the three-dimensional cam 79. The leverage can be varied by moving a fulcrum 88 lengthwise of lever 85 by means of a manually operated lever 28. Turbine discharge temperature is sensed by a thermometer 23, which applies a signal to a variable resistor 104 which is adjusted in accordance with the compressor inlet temperature by means of the cam 101 and follower 102, the output of the variable resistor being fed to an amplifier 105 as a reference signal. The signal developed by the thermometer 23 is also applied directly to the amplifier 105, which responds to the difference between this signal and the reference signal. A solenoid 106, energized by the amplifier 105, adjusts the lever 87 between stops 108 and 109. The reheat fuel control 14 includes cams 113, 114 movably axially in response to the compressor discharge pressure, to determine the inclination of a beam 118. The beam 118 controls a fuel metering valve 112 through linkage 128, 133. A throttling valve 111 maintains the pressure difference across the metering valve 112. The link 128 can be displaced transversely by a manually operable lever 27, to provide a reheat fuel flow between a minimum value determined by cam 114 and a maximum value determined by cam 113. The levers 27, 28, 29 are connected together to be moved in unison by means of the pilot's thrust selector lever.",GEN ELECTRIC,CROWELL WALTER;;WANGER ROBERT PRICE;;NORDWALD LEO,,https://lens.org/098-242-002-019-774,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,F02C9/16;;F02K1/16,F02C9/16;;F02K1/16,F1C CD            CD;;F1C C103          CD;;F1C C502          CD;;F1C C503          CD;;F1C C513          CD;;F1C C515          CD;;F1C C530          CD;;F1C C602          CD;;F1G G10E1A1       G10E2A;;F1G G10E1B3       G10E2A;;F1G G10E1B4       G10E2A;;F1G G5C3A         G5C3A;;F1J J1F1          J2A1C;;F1J J1F2C2        J2A1C;;F1J J3            J2A1C;;G3N NE1A          E1A;;G3N NGE1A         GE1A;;G3N N288B         GE1A,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The control module includes a power device, connected to a line voltage, and a thermal pad. The power device provides a first layer of electrical insulation between the line voltage and an external tab of the power device while the thermal pad provides a second layer of electrical insulation. The combined first and second layers provide a minimum amount of electrical insulation between the line voltage and the tool housing thereby preventing electrical shock.
