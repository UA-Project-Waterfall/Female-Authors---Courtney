[Also in Division H1] In a transformer core assembled from two complementary stacks of laminµ Q, R joined over smoothed surfaces with corresponding laminµ in each stack aligned with each other, each stack is formed by placing the laminµ face to face in a jig, and securing them together by coating a side of the stack with a self-setting adhesive. The surfaces may be smoothed by grinding, lapping or milling. Each lamina is welded, spot-welded, brazed or soldered to the lamina with which it is aligned. Alternatively, only the outermost laminµ may be joined. Paper impregnated with semi-cured resin may be wound around a core thus formed. It may be used to secure a mounting lug and also to form a gapped core, the required thickness of paper being inserted between two faces which need not have been smoothed, the resin mechanically joining the faces.",LINTON & HIRST LTD,PICKLES KATHLEEN MARY;;HIRST HARRY;;FRENCH WILLIAM GEORGE,,https://lens.org/120-284-813-345-929,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,6,0,H01F27/245;;H01F41/0233,H01F27/245;;H01F41/02,B3A A44           -;;B3V V10           -;;H1T T1F           -;;H1T T7A10A        -;;H1T T7A10B        -;;H1T T7A11         T1F/;;H1T T7A2B         -;;H1T T7A3          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
