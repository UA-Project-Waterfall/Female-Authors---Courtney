    An event management service (EMS) of a distributed computing environment includes a filter mechanism for determining whether events generated by one or more event suppliers are communicated to one or more event consumers. Each event consumer that registers for the service also defines an event filter group that determines whether particular events generated by the one or more event suppliers are communicated to that event consumer. The event filter group is derived from one or more predefined event type schemas and/or event header information. Events supplied to the service are applied through a parser of the filter mechanism to control whether and where a particular event is routed.

The process may involve selecting different subsets of one or more of the categories in a given set of categories for use at different times, depending on factors such as call volume. The call selection computation may involve, for example, computing a value for each of the skills, as a function of the corresponding level or levels and a wait time measure, e.g., a current wait time, a predicted wait time, or a ratio of predicted wait time to a service objective, for a call in a corresponding skill queue.",AVAYA TECHNOLOGY CORP,COHEN RICHARD ALAN;;FOSTER ROBIN H,AVAYA TECHNOLOGY CORP (2000-09-29);;LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES INC (1998-12-22),https://lens.org/040-599-449-434-461,Granted Patent,yes,9,42,9,9,0,H04M3/523;;H04M3/523,H04M3/00;;H04M3/523;;H04M3/60,379/265;;379/265.02,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A relative measure of a phase angle difference between two phases permits each phase to be controlled to obtain the desired phase angle difference. The power conversion involves transition mode switching to help reduce switching losses. A phase angle difference detector may be provided for each phase. The various phases may have different inherent frequencies that vary with switching frequency, and are synchronized to an average frequency. Current measures can be taken with a single component, such as a resistor. A maximum frequency control limits period width to avoid high frequency switching.

The power conversion involves variable frequency switching, fixed on-time and provides power factor correction. A relative measure of a phase angle difference between two phases permits each phase to be controlled to obtain the desired phase angle difference. The power conversion involves transition mode switching to help reduce switching losses. A phase angle difference detector may be provided for each phase. The various phases may have different inherent frequencies that vary with switching frequency, and are synchronized to an average frequency. Current measures can be taken with a single component, such as a resistor. A maximum frequency control limits period width to avoid high frequency switching.

Monitoring is then effected (300-366) as follows. Periodically, the contact center is automatically polled for performanc e data, actual values of the skill attributes are computed therefrom, and the actual values, the objective values, and the tolerances are used in a meta formula to determine the performance metrics. When skills are distributed across several locations of a distributed contact center, the arrangement determines the performance metrics for each location, and further determines whether the maximum deviation between the locations of their actual values exceeds the maximum acceptable deviation.

Adjustments may be made in the load balancing process, such as selection of one type of load balancing over another for use at a particular time, based at least in part on the multi-site performance score. The multi-site performance score may be determined using single-site performance measures such as Average Speed of Answer (ASA) and agent occupancy generated across multiple time intervals. The multi-site performance score as generated for a given interval may be, e.g., a ratio of the maximum and minimum values of a single-site performance measure for that interval. As another example, the multi-site performance score may be in the form of a standard deviation of a set of normalized scores generated for the multiple sites across the specified time intervals.

   A method is provided for the manufacture of micro-structures, such as micro-electromechanical structures (MEMS) or silicon optical benches (SiOB). The method includes using a single mask to pattern two or more cavity areas to be etched into a substrate in different etching steps, and then selectively choosing the cavity areas for etching. In a preferred embodiment, the method includes patterning a substrate to identify a plurality of cavity areas to be etched into the substrate and filling at least one of the cavity areas with a distinctive filler material. Filler material is chemically distinctive in the sense that it can be etched selectively with respect to the other filling materials. At least one of the cavity areas containing a distinctive filler material is then chosen based at least in part on the distinctive filler material. The chosen cavity area is then etched. The methods of the invention produce micro-structures with more accurate cavity areas by minimizing overlay error and avoiding the need for lithography over extreme topography. The micro-structures manufactured by the methods of the invention are also provided herein.

   An over voltage spike or surge protection principle is provided that involves an element that is positioned between a node in the circuitry and a reference voltage that performs as an insulator as voltage across the element increases and at a selectable voltage, the current at any higher voltage such as during a spike or a surge is shunted to reference or ground, the element is not damaged by the breakdown type of the effect of the shunting of the current, and then, after the duration of the high voltage excursion the element returns to the performance before the selectable voltage. The principle of the invention permits in-situ or locallized over voltage protection to selected nodes throughout circuitry as well as throughout an integrated circuit including the interface with external circuitry.

Existing contact-center monitoring arrangements tend to have a narrow focus and tend to concentrate either on call routing or on monitoring a limited set of attributes while the contact center is operational. An arrangement (100) for monitoring contact-center (104-108) performance automates the monitoring process by using a database schema (250-270) that records (200-224) the contact center to be monitored, its skills, the locations where the skills are located (in the case of a distributed contact center), the objective or target value for a given skill attribute (such as average speed of answer, maximum delay, etc.), the acceptable deviation from the objective (tolerance), the maximum acceptable deviation between locations (in the case of a distributed contact center), the periodicity or frequency of the monitoring, and the comparison operator needed to determine how a given observed or actual value for the skill attribute is to be compared with its specified objective and tolerance. The performance metric determination is thus dynamic: that is, performance is determined ""on the fly"" at run time at the time that the contact center is polled for performance-indicative data, and there is no a-priori fixed formula of how to compare an observed skill-attribute value with its specified objective and tolerance to determine a metric for a specified contact center.

The system generates a multi-site performance score characterizing the performance of the load balancing process. Adjustments may be made in the load balancing process, such as selection of one type of load balancing over another for use at a particular time, based at least in part on the multi-site performance score. The multi-site performance score may be determined using single-site performance measures such as Average Speed of Answer (ASA) and agent occupancy generated across multiple time intervals. The multi-site performance score as generated for a given interval may be, e.g., a ratio of the maximum and minimum values of a single-site performance measure for that interval. As another example, the multi-site performance score may be in the form of a standard deviation of a set of normalized scores generated for the multiple sites across the specified time intervals.

    An arrangement (  100  ) for monitoring contact-center (  104-108  ) performance automates the monitoring process by using a database schema (  250-270  ) that records (  200-224  ) the contact center to be monitored, its skills, the locations where the skills are located (in the case of a distributed contact center), the objective or target value for a given skill attribute (such as average speed of answer, maximum delay, etc.), the acceptable deviation from the objective (tolerance), the maximum acceptable deviation between locations (in the case of a distributed contact center), the periodicity or frequency of the monitoring, and the comparison operator needed to determine how a given observed or actual value for the skill attribute is to be compared with its specified objective and tolerance. Monitoring is then effected (  300-366  ) as follows. Periodically, the contact center is automatically polled for performance data, actual values of the skill attributes are computed therefrom, and the actual values, the objective values, and the tolerances are used in a meta formula to determine the performance metrics. When skills are distributed across several locations of a distributed contact center, the arrangement determines the performance metrics for each location, and further determines whether the maximum deviation between the locations of their actual values exceeds the maximum acceptable deviation. Results indicating performance outages are sent to a party that is responsible for the contact center.

   A medical testing system includes telemetry features whereby physiological data collected by a collection device at a medical facility is transmitted to a remote processing center for analysis by a trained analyst to provide a test result. In one embodiment, the collection device is a heart rate monitor capable of collecting data with which heart rate variability can be assessed. The heart rate monitor includes a display on which is displayed a waveform showing the breathing performance of the patient during data collection along with standards against which to compare the waveform in order to determine the extent to which the patient followed a predetermined breathing regimen during data collection. The operator of the monitor can use the performance waveform to assess how well the test was taken (i.e., how well the patient complied with the prescribed breathing regimen) and can accept or reject the physiological data accordingly. Also described is a medical testing telemetry system including two processing centers, with each collection device being capable of communicating with both processing centers. Each collection device randomly chooses one of the processing centers for analysis of the collected physiological data. The two processing centers are interconnected in order to permit physiological data and test results to be replicated and stored at both sites.

The present invention allows flexible control of a focused ultrasound wave using mechanical and electrical control. The transducer array is implemented on a flexible substrate that can be mechanically controlled through two or more physical configurations. As with conventional electronic “steering,” the transducer elements can be controlled electronically to provide adjustable focus of the ultrasound. The combination of mechanical and electronic control provides the device a very flexible method for delivering focused ultrasound. The invention also includes a design that allows integration of ultrasound and endoscopic image guidance. The ultrasound guidance includes anatomical visualization and functional imaging (e.g. blood flow and coagulation of vasculature). The ultrasound imaging transducer is used for thermometry within the region of interest for treatment.

These tasks can include launching an application, authenticating a user at a website, and completing a sales transaction at a website (e.g., by filling out a form automatically). The interaction between the base station and the electronic card is accomplished by using the conventional sound system in the base station so that a special reader hardware need not be installed to interact with the electronic card.

    The interactive authentication system allows a consumer to interact with a base station, such as broadcast media (e.g., television and radio) or PC, to receive coupons, special sales offers, and other information with an electronic card. The electronic card can also be used to transmit a signal that can be received by the base station to perform a wide variety of tasks. These tasks can include launching an application, authenticating a user at a website, and completing a sales transaction at a website (e.g., by filling out a form automatically). The interaction between the base station and the electronic card is accomplished by using the conventional sound system in the base station so that a special reader hardware need not be installed to interact with the electronic card. The user is equipped with an electronic card that can receive and transmit data via sound waves. In the various embodiments, the sound waves can be audible or ultrasonic (which can be slightly audible to some groups of people).

The electronic card can also be used to transmit a signal that can be received by the base station to perform a wide variety of tasks. These tasks can include launching an application, authenticating a user at a website, and completing a sales transaction at a website (e.g., by filling out a form automatically). The interaction between the base station and the electronic card is accomplished by using the conventional sounds system in the base station so that a special reader hardware need not be installed to interact with the electronic card. The user is equipped with an electronic card that can receive and transmit data via sound waves. In the various embodiments, the sound waves can be audible or ultrasonic (which can be slightly audible to some groups of people).",COMSENSE TECHNOLOGIES LTD;;ATSMON ALON;;ANTEBI AMIT;;LEV TSVI;;COHEN MOSHE;;SPEYER GAVRIEL;;SEGE ALAN;;ALTIMAN NATHAN;;ANATI RAMI,ATSMON ALON;;ANTEBI AMIT;;LEV TSVI;;COHEN MOSHE;;SPEYER GAVRIEL;;SEGE ALAN;;ALTIMAN NATHAN;;ANATI RAMI,,https://lens.org/197-093-686-436-140,Patent Application,yes,0,12,44,44,0,G06F21/41;;G06F21/445;;G06F2221/2103;;G06Q20/00;;G06Q20/12;;G06Q20/327;;G06Q20/3415;;G06Q20/342;;G06Q20/343;;G06Q20/346;;G06Q20/3576;;G06Q20/387;;G06Q20/40975;;G06Q30/0207;;G06Q30/0225;;G07F7/02;;G07F7/025;;G07F7/1008;;G07G1/0036;;H04B11/00;;G06F21/34;;G06Q20/341;;G06Q20/10;;G06Q20/40;;G07F7/1008;;G07F7/025;;G06Q20/3415;;G06Q30/0207;;G06Q20/346;;G06Q20/3576;;G06Q20/343;;G06Q20/12;;G06F2221/2103;;G06Q20/327;;G07G1/0036;;G06F21/445;;G06Q20/387;;G06Q20/32;;H04B11/00;;G06Q20/00;;G06Q20/40975;;G06Q20/342;;G06Q30/0225;;G07F7/02;;G06F21/41;;G06F21/34;;G06Q20/341;;G06Q20/10;;G06Q20/40,G06F21/00;;G06Q20/00;;G07F7/02;;G07F7/08;;G07F7/10;;G07G1/00;;H04B11/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

   A metal plus low dielectric constant (low-k) interconnect structure is provided for a semiconductor device wherein adjacent regions in a surface separated by a dielectric have dimensions in width and spacing in the sub 250 nanometer range, and in which reduced lateral leakage current between adjacent metal lines, and a lower effective dielectric constant than a conventional structure, is achieved by the positioning of a differentiating or mask member that is applied for the protection of the dielectric in subsequent processing operations, at a position about 2-5 nanometers below a, to be planarized, surface where there will be a lower electric field. The invention is particularly useful in the damascene type device structure in the art wherein adjacent conductors extend from a substrate through an interlevel dielectric material, connections are made in a trench, a diffusion barrier liner is provided in the interlevel dilectric material and masking is employed to protect the dilectric material between conductors during processing operations.

The process involves fabricating the multilayer interconnect wiring structure by methods and materials currently known in the state of the art of semiconductor processing; removing the intralevel dielectric between the adjacent metal features by a suitable etching process; applying a thin passivation coating over the exposed etched structure; annealing the etched structure to remove plasma damage; laminating an insulating cover layer to the top surface of the passivated metal features; optionally depositing an insulating environmental barrier layer on top of the cover layer; etching vias in the environmental barrier layer, cover layer and the thin passivation layer for terminal pad contacts; and completing the device by fabricating terminal input/output pads. The method obviates issues such as processability and thermal stability associated with low dielectric constant materials by avoiding their use. Since air, which has the lowest dielectric constant, is used as the intralevel dielectric the structure created by this method would possess a very low capacitance and hence fast propagation speeds.

The invention further provides novel Echinocandin type compounds and their use as antifungal or anti-parasitic agents.",LILLY CO ELI;;BORROMEO PETER STANLEY;;COHEN JEFFREY DANIEL;;GREGORY GEORGE STUART;;HENLE STACY KAY;;HITCHCOCK STEPHEN ANDREW;;JUNGHEIM LOUIS NICKOLAUS;;MAYHUGH DANIEL RAY;;SHEPHERD TIMOTHY ALAN;;TURNER WILLIAM WILSON JR,BORROMEO PETER STANLEY;;COHEN JEFFREY DANIEL;;GREGORY GEORGE STUART;;HENLE STACY KAY;;HITCHCOCK STEPHEN ANDREW;;JUNGHEIM LOUIS NICKOLAUS;;MAYHUGH DANIEL RAY;;SHEPHERD TIMOTHY ALAN;;TURNER WILLIAM WILSON JR,,https://lens.org/113-276-636-775-616,Search Report,yes,0,0,17,17,0,A61K38/00;;C07K7/50;;C07K7/56;;A61P31/10;;A61P33/00;;Y02A50/30;;C07K7/50;;A61K38/00;;C07K7/56;;Y02A50/30,A61K9/72;;A61K38/00;;A61K9/08;;A61P31/10;;A61P33/00;;C07K1/06;;C07K7/50;;C07K7/54;;C07K7/56;;C07K7/64,,4,4,101-178-598-441-281;;031-803-770-910-400;;012-100-213-163-334;;011-098-930-627-430,10.1016/s0040-4020(01)87959-x;;1490878;;10.7164/antibiotics.45.1875;;9544949;;10.7164/antibiotics.51.239;;10.1021/jm00093a018;;1495015,"NATSUKO KUROKAWA ET AL: ""SYNTHETIC STUDIES ON ANTIFUNGAL CYCLIC PEPTIDES, ECHINOCANDINS.

   Tracer visibility of APFSDS projectiles can be enhanced through a combination of increased steady state spin rate, reduced muzzle obscuration, and optimized airflow over the stabilizing fin geometry of the sub-projectile. The preferred means to increase steady state spin rates of the sub-projectile is to incline or deflect the fin blade tip portion, creating a larger, hotter burning, tracer plume.

   A uniformly thick oxide film on a substrate is formed by using an anodization apparatus which deposits a blanket precursor film on a surface of a substrate; provides electrical contact to the precursor film; moves the precursor film into contact with an electrolyte solution such that substantially all electrically conductive surfaces, e.g., pin contacts, the substrate edge and a backside of the substrate are electrically isolated from the electrolyte; ensures that the surface of the precursor film on the substrate is in direct contact with the electrolyte solution; and which applies an anodizing current and/or voltage between the precursor film and a counter electrode so as to compensate for a voltage drop resulting from the presence of the electrolyte.

SOLUTION: An outer member 42 is tightly fitted in an internal member 40, thereby forming a cooling passage 46. The outer member 42 is laid out so that an inlet 52 of the cooling passage 46 may be exposed to a cooling air. The cooling air flows by way of the passage 46, thereby cooling an interior wall 56 at a higher temperature. During the operation of a combustor, a high temperature combustion gas flowing by the inner side portion of the combustor holds the internal member 40 at a higher temperature than the outer member 42. Due to this, a differential expansion serves to hold both members in a firmly united state, which makes it possible to prevent the outer member from being slipped by matching a mechanical stopper means or the like on the rear end of the inner member 40.",GEN ELECTRIC,RITTER ANN MELINDA;;ROBERT PATRICK CAMPBELL;;MELVIN ROBERT JACKSON;;MCCLEAN ROSS ANTHONY;;COHEN MITCHELL REUBEN;;ABUAF NESIN;;CORREA SANJAY MARC;;PETERSON LANCE GORDON;;MUTH MYRON CLYDE;;BELTRAN ADRIAN MAURICE;;MINAS CONSTANTINOS;;SCHUMACHER DAVID ROBERT;;GRAVES JEFFREY ALAN,,https://lens.org/141-018-575-416-516,Patent Application,no,0,4,8,8,0,B23P11/025;;B23P11/025;;B23P15/00;;B23P15/00;;B23P2700/13;;B23P2700/13;;F23R3/002;;F23R3/002,F02C7/00;;B23P11/02;;B23P15/00;;F02C7/18;;F23R3/00;;F23R3/42,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The passages preferably extend both axially and circumferentially with respect to the direction of flow through the combustor/transition piece. The axial passages extend completely from one end to the other and the circumferential passages extend around the circumference of the combustor/transition piece. The addition of a circumferential cross-flow passage connecting axial flow coolant passages in double wall turbine components can prevent combustor/transition piece part failure due to axial passage inlet blockage without affecting normal, unblocked cooling. Double wall cooling structures are constructed using two unbonded members. The inner member is machined to form cooling passages. Differential thermal expansion (expansion of the outside diameter of the hot inner wall until contact is established with the inside diameter of the cooler outer wall) keeps the cylinders held tightly together. Double wall cooling structures are also constructed using two members shrink-fitted and then bonded together such as by welding. The inner member is machined to form the cooling passages. The improved thermal contact between the outer and inner members due to the joint reduces the thermally induced stresses in the two members.",GEN ELECTRIC,RITTER ANN MELINDA;;CAMPBELL ROBERT PATRICK;;JACKSON MELVIN ROBERT;;MCLEAN ROSS ANTHONY;;COHEN MITCHELL REUBEN;;ABUAF NESIM;;CORREA SANJAY MARC;;PETERSON LANCE GORDON;;MUTH MYRON CLYDE;;BELTRAN ADRIAN MAURICE;;MINAS CONSTANTINOS;;SCHUMACHER DAVID ROBERT;;GRAVES JEFFREY ALAN,GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY (1996-06-03),https://lens.org/031-729-039-364-794,Granted Patent,yes,3,87,8,8,0,B23P11/025;;B23P11/025;;B23P15/00;;B23P15/00;;B23P2700/13;;B23P2700/13;;F23R3/002;;F23R3/002,F02C7/00;;B23P11/02;;B23P15/00;;F02C7/18;;F23R3/00;;F23R3/42,60/752,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
