The method includes positioning an absorbent element in the flow stream between the noise source and the reference point. Then, the ultrasonic noise is directed past vicinity of the absorbent element such that indirect ultrasonic noise is absorbed by the absorbent element. Preferably, the method also includes deflecting the ultrasonic noise to convert direct noise to indirect noise prior to directing the ultrasonic noise past the vicinity of the absorbent material in the flow stream.

Nominal values of the engine intake air parameter at various throttle notch settings and various engine performance parameters are stored in a table, for a nominal barometric pressure.

The barometric pressure timing controller then adjusts fuel injection timing in response to the thusly determined barometric pressure and the sensed throttle position, by advancing or retarding the fuel injection timing by predetermined values as the barometric pressure or the throttle position changes.

This sensor communicates with a barometric pressure timing controller, and a throttle position sensor communicates with the barometric pressure timing controller. Nominal values of the engine intake air parameter at various throttle notch settings and various engine performance parameters are stored in a table, for a nominal barometric pressure. The barometric pressure timing 10 controller determines the instantaneous barometric pressure by adjusting the nominal barometric pressure based on the difference between the instantaneous value for the engine intake air parameter and the nominal value for the engine intake air parameter, at the known throttle notch setting and the known engine performance parameters. The barometric pressure timing controller then adjusts fuel injection timing in 15 response to the thusly determined barometric pressure and the sensed throttle position, by advancing or retarding the fuel injection timing by predetermined values as the barometric pressure or the throttle position changes. The predetermined values of fuel injection timing are selected to reduce exhaust emissions and increase engine efficiency and performance under various barometric pressure conditions so that the 20 engine may be operated continually and optimally under various barometric pressure conditions. zE P caa F 4z Od8 *) 0 L V)",GEN ELECTRIC,SHAWN MICHAEL GALLAGHER ERIC RICHARD DILLEN,,https://lens.org/080-858-326-909-409,Granted Patent,no,6,0,5,8,0,,F02D41/40;;F02D41/30;;F02D41/38,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

In general, the systems and methods implement a machine-learned recognizability model that can process information such as a person's voice, facial characteristics, or similar information to determine a recognizability score without necessarily generating or storing biometric information that could be used to identify the person. The recognizability score can act as a proxy for the quality of the information as a reference for biometric recognition that can be performed on other devices in the network of devices. Thus a single device can be used to enroll a person in the network (e.g., by capturing a number of photographs of the person). Thereafter, connection to the other devices can utilize a sensor (e.g., a camera) on the other devices to compare features of the reference information to the input received by the sensor.",GOOGLE LLC;;GALLAGHER ANDREW;;ROTH JOSEPH EDWARD;;NECHYBA MICHAEL CHRISTIAN,GALLAGHER ANDREW;;ROTH JOSEPH;;NECHYBA MICHAEL,,https://lens.org/060-621-977-815-165,Patent Application,yes,0,1,6,6,0,G06V40/172;;G06V10/94;;G06V40/172;;G06V10/94;;G06N20/00;;G06F16/583;;G06V40/172;;G06V10/70;;G06V40/50,G06K9/00,,3,2,097-432-609-236-020;;028-342-931-103-70X,10.1109/btas.2010.5634523;;10.1109/btas.2018.8698593,"WHEELER F W ET AL: ""Face recognition at a distance system for surveillance applications"", BIOMETRICS: THEORY APPLICATIONS AND SYSTEMS (BTAS), 2010 FOURTH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON, IEEE, PISCATAWAY, NJ, USA, 27 September 2010 (2010-09-27), pages 1 - 8, XP031800547, ISBN: 978-1-4244-7581-0;;WASNIK PANKAJ ET AL: ""An Empirical Evaluation of Deep Architectures on Generalization of Smartphone-based Face Image Quality Assessment"", 2018 IEEE 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMETRICS THEORY, APPLICATIONS AND SYSTEMS (BTAS), IEEE, 22 October 2018 (2018-10-22), pages 1 - 7, XP033541791, DOI: 10.1109/BTAS.2018.8698593;;SCHROFF ET AL., FACENET: A UNIFIED EMBEDDING FOR FACE RECOGNITION AND CLUSTERING, Retrieved from the Internet <URL:https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832>",PENDING

This separation of the broken door portion from the vehicle structure is prevented by a tethering hinge (50) that is formed of a strong flexible sheet material that spans this critical juncture between the mounting/hinge flange and door and remains flexible at these very cold temperatures to retain the broken door portion to the vehicle structure.",DAVIDSON TEXTRON INC,GALLAGHER MICHAEL J;;IANNAZZI PETER J,,https://lens.org/162-211-325-071-216,Patent Application,no,0,0,15,16,0,B60R21/16;;B60R21/216;;B60R21/216;;B29C37/0057;;B29C37/0057;;B29C37/0085;;B29C37/0085;;B29C65/02;;B29C65/02;;B29C65/04;;B29C65/04;;B29C65/06;;B29C65/06;;B29C65/08;;B29C65/08;;B29C65/14;;B29C65/14;;B29C65/1425;;B29C65/1425;;B29C65/18;;B29C65/18;;B29C65/36;;B29C65/36;;B29C65/364;;B29C65/364;;B29C65/3656;;B29C65/3656;;B29C65/48;;B29C65/48;;B29C66/1122;;B29C66/1122;;B29C66/21;;B29C66/21;;B29C66/5326;;B29C66/5326;;B29C66/71;;B29C66/71;;B29C66/7392;;B29C66/7392;;B29C66/73921;;B29C66/73921;;B29C66/7394;;B29C66/7394;;B29C66/8322;;B29C66/8322;;B29L2031/3038;;B29L2031/3038;;B60K37/00;;B60K37/00;;B60R11/02;;B60R11/02;;B60R11/0205;;B60R11/0205;;B60R11/0211;;B60R11/0211;;B60R11/0229;;B60R11/0229;;B60R11/0252;;B60R11/0252;;B60R13/0256;;B60R13/0256;;B60R13/0262;;B60R13/0262;;B60R13/0275;;B60R13/0275;;B60R13/0815;;B60R13/0815;;B60R13/0846;;B60R13/0846;;B60R21/2165;;B60R21/2165;;B60R2011/0005;;B60R2011/0005;;B60R2011/0007;;B60R2011/0007;;B60R2011/0043;;B60R2011/0043;;B60R2011/0045;;B60R2011/0045;;B60R2011/0082;;B60R2011/0082;;B60R2011/0092;;B60R2011/0092;;B60R2011/0094;;B60R2011/0094;;B60R2011/0096;;B60R2011/0096;;B60R2011/0276;;B60R2011/0276;;B60R2013/0287;;B60R2013/0287;;B60R2021/21537;;B60R2021/21537,B60K37/00;;B29C37/00;;B29C65/02;;B29C65/04;;B29C65/06;;B29C65/08;;B29C65/14;;B29C65/18;;B29C65/36;;B29C65/48;;B60R11/00;;B60R11/02;;B60R13/02;;B60R13/08;;B60R21/215;;B60R21/216;;B60R21/2165,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Building- wide performance is achieved by aggregating empirically determined room-level loads, thus ensuring that the coupled performance objectives can be achieved while minimizing energy use for every space within a building.",UNIV BOSTON,WROBLEWSKI DONALD;;GEVELBER MICHAEL;;GALLAGHER PAUL DONALD,,https://lens.org/083-665-993-189-853,Patent Application,yes,5,7,3,3,0,F24F3/0442;;F24F11/30;;F24F2110/30;;F24F11/52;;F24F11/46;;F24F3/0442;;F24F11/30;;F24F2110/30;;F24F11/52;;Y02B30/70;;F24F11/46,F24F11/02;;F24F7/10;;F24F11/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

    In a communication satellite constellation which uses CDMA and multiple spot beams for point-to-point communication, a system is provided for broadcasting regionally related information within a spot beam by establishing a Frequency/Walsh Code Tiling over the Earth's surface, and enabling a user terminal at a given position to tune to an appropriate frequency and Walsh Code to receive the information broadcast from a satellite over a forward beam downlink. The information, e.g. regional messages such as local weather or traffic, is transmitted to the satellite from a ground station or gateway that receives the information from a Broadcast Processing Center. In a preferred embodiment a dedicated Frequency Division Multiplex (FDM) channel within each spot beam transmits the regional broadcast messages at the Tiles in accordance with the Walsh Code designations of the Tiles.

The recognizability score can act as a proxy for the quality of the information as a reference for biometric recognition that can be performed on other devices in the network of devices. Thus a single device can be used to enroll a person in the network (e.g., by capturing a number of photographs of the person).

    An optical splice joint and splicing process are provided for joining an end portion of a microstructured optical fiber having a microstructure formed from an array of holes, and a conventional optical fiber. The optical splice joint is formed from a fused portion of opposing end portions of the microstructured optical fiber and optical fiber, wherein the microstructured optical fiber is surrounded by a jacket that is at least 1.6 times thicker along its radius than the microstructure, and has a tensile strength of at least 30 Kpsi with an optical loss of less than 0.30 dB, and relatively little shrinkage (i.e., about 30%) of the holes forming the microstructure. The splice joint is formed by aligning end portions of the microstructured optical fiber and the optical fiber, in a fusion splicer, and applying fusion heat to the fiber ends in a two step process with a low current arc that is offset with respect to the end of the microstructured optical fiber.

   An optical splice joint and splicing process are provided for joining an end portion of a microstructured optical fiber having a microstructure formed from an array of holes, and a conventional optical fiber. The optical splice joint is formed from a fused portion of opposing end portions of the microstructured optical fiber and optical fiber, wherein the microstructured optical fiber is surrounded by a jacket that is at least 1.6 times thicker along its radius than the microstructure, and has a tensile strength of at least 30 Kpsi with an optical loss of less than 0.30 dB, and relatively little shrinkage (i.e., about 30%) of the holes forming the microstructure. The splice joint is formed by aligning end portions of the microstructured optical fiber and the optical fiber, in a fusion splicer, and applying fusion heat to the fiber ends in a two step process with a low current arc that is offset with respect to the end of the microstructured optical fiber.

    A method of forming a motor vehicle instrument panel with a flexibly tethered air bag deployment door includes the steps of molding an instrument panel with a first plastics material to a desired shape and with an integral air bag deployment door whose opening is defined by a tear seam formed by a groove molded in one side of the panel and with an integral mounting/hinge flange that extends from an inside surface of the door, and forming a bonded layer of second plastics material on one side of the flange and the inside surface of a potentially frangible portion of the door. The second plastics material has the physical characteristic of remaining ductile to a substantial degree at low temperatures substantial below the temperature at which the first plastics material becomes brittle and as a result the bonded layer forms a tether that connects the frangible door portion to the mounting/hinge flange in a flexible manner when this door portion breaks away from the flange because of embrittlement of the first plastics material at the low temperatures on tearing of the tear seam and opening movement of the door by an inflating air bag pressing against the inside surface of the frangible door portion.

    A diesel locomotive includes a number of auxiliary subsystems operating in conjunction with the locomotive diesel engine and deriving their energy, from the diesel engine. Included among the subsystems are various cooling systems, the battery charging system, and the electrical generation system, comprising one or more alternators drivingly coupled to the engine shaft. Each of the subsystems includes a component that is activated when one or more operational conditions associated with the subsystem are met. For instance, an engine cooling system fan motor is activated when the coolant temperature exceeds a predetermined value. Similarly, a battery charger is activated when the battery voltage falls below a predetermined value, and an alternator blower is activated when the main or auxiliary alternator temperature exceeds a predetermined value. The activation of these power consuming auxiliary devices while the diesel engine is transitioning from a first load state to a higher load state, causes the formation of excessive smoke emissions. According to the present invention, the activation of these auxiliary components is delayed until the diesel engine has reached steady-state operation, after which the elements are activated as required. Also, in the event a subsystem operational parameter exceeds a predetermined critical limit, the auxiliary device is immediately activated, even if the diesel engine is in a transition state to a higher load value.

I/O requests are queued by a requesting MPU in a memory shared with one or more IOPs. Each IOP is associated with a queue. Each IOP may continue processing queued I/O requests after completing processing on an earlier request. In addition, each MPU is associated with a queue shared with the IOPs. When an IOP completes processing of an I/O request, a completion message is added to the requesting MPU's queue and an interrupt is generated for that MPU. The MPU services all completion messages in its queue when the interrupt is processed. A threshold value is associated with each MPU queue. The threshold value indicates the minimum number of completed I/O requests required before an interrupt request is generated to the MPU. The threshold value for each MPU may be tuned to permit the computing system to balance the need for rapid I/O response time with the need for reduced interrupt overhead processing in the MPU. Various physical embodiments of the invention are disclosed wherein the queue is located in either a shared memory or in a register file. Additionally, various embodiments separate the queue used to store new I/O requests from the queue used to store completion messages while other embodiments merge the two queuing functions into a single queue where each entry contains an I/O request with a completion status field.",SYMBIOS LOGIC INC,BINFORD CHARLES D;;GALLAGHER MICHAEL J;;MCCOMBS CRAIG C,AVAGO TECHNOLOGIES GENERAL IP (SINGAPORE) PTE.

    A diesel engine, having a plurality of individually controllable fuel injected cylinders, is operated in a skip firing mode to reduce smoke emissions during low power operation. The system senses certain identified engine operating parameters and when these parameters exceed predetermined thresholds for a predetermined time, then the skip firing is implemented. In another embodiment, it is possible to implement several different skip firing patterns dependent upon engine performance. Upon implementation of skip firing, the engine timing angle is reset by a fixed angle and a multiplication factor is included in the speed loop integrator to ensure that the appropriate fuel volume value is injected into each cylinder immediately upon initiation of skip firing.

The system includes four separate active phased-array antennas, each with ± 45° coverage in azimuth, from 0° to 60° in elevation. Each antema element of each phased-array antenna is coupled by a low-loss path to the solid-state amplifier associated with a transmit-receive (TR) module. Each antenna produces a sequence of pencil beams, which requires less transmitted power from the TR modules than a fan beam, but requires more time because the pencil beam must be sequenced to cover the same volume as the fan beam. In order to scan the volume in a short time, the PRF is responsive to the elevation angle of the beam, so higher elevation angles use a higher PRF. Low elevation angle beams receive long transmitter pulses for high power, and pulse compression is used to restore range resolution, but the long pulse results in a large minimum range within which targets cannot be detected. A second scan is provided at low elevation angles with a short transmitter pulse to fill in the short-range coverage. Beams at higher elevation angles transmit pulse widths which are shorter than beams at low elevation angles, so that the minimum range requirement is met without a second scan, which also reduces the time required for volumetric scan. The number of pulses which are integrated to produce a return increases off-axis, to restore system margin lost due to off-axis power gain reduction. The volumetric scan rate is increased by a dynamic scan regimen by which subsets of beams are pulsed with a high transmitter PRF but with a low effective beam PRF to reduce range ambiguity and preserve Doppler resolution without the usual increase of scan time. For best range resolution, Doppler processing is used, with range sidelobe pulse suppression applied separately to each Doppler frequency bin.",GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY,"FREEDMAN, JEROME EDWIN;;PERRY, MICHAEL STOCKUM;;GALLAGHER, JOHN JAMES",,https://lens.org/019-744-588-398-031,Search Report,yes,5,0,4,4,0,G01S7/032;;G01S7/032;;G01S13/22;;G01S13/22;;G01S13/426;;G01S13/426;;G01S13/91;;G01S13/91;;G01S2013/0254;;G01S2013/0254;;H01Q3/26;;H01Q3/26,G01S7/02;;G01S7/03;;G01S7/282;;G01S13/12;;G01S13/22;;G01S13/28;;G01S13/42;;G01S13/44;;G01S13/87;;G01S13/91;;G01S13/95;;H01Q3/26,,1,0,,,"AVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY, vol. 133, no. 1, 2nd July 1990, pages 49-51, New York, US; B.D.

The system includes four separate active phased-array antennas, each with .+-.45.degree. coverage in azimuth, from 0.degree. to 60.degree. in elevation. Each antenna element of each phased-array antenna is coupled by a low-loss path to the solid-state amplifier associated with a transmit-receive (TR) module. Each antenna produces a sequence of pencil beams, which requires less transmitted power from the TR modules than a fan beam, but requires more time because the pencil beam must be sequenced to cover the same volume as the fan beam. In order to scan the volume in a short time, the PRF is responsive to the elevation angle of the beam, so higher elevation angles use a higher PRF. Low elevation angle beams receive long transmitter pulses for high power, and pulse compression is used to restored range resolution, but the long pulse results in a large minimum range within which targets cannot be detected. A second can is provided at low elevation angles with a short transmitter pulse to fill in the short-range coverage. Beams at higher elevation angles transmit pulse widths which are shorter than beams at low elevation angles, so that the minimum range requirement is met without a second scan, which also reduces the time required for volumetric scan. The number of pulses which are integrated to produce a return increases off-axis, to restore system margin lost due to off-axis power gain reduction. The volumetric scan rate is increased by a dynamic scan regimen by which subsets of beams are pulsed with a high transmitter PRF but with a low effective beam PRF to reduce range ambiguity and preserve Doppler resolution without the usual increase of scan time. For best range resolution, Doppler processing is used, with range sidelobe pulse suppression applied separately to each Doppler frequency bin.",GEN ELECTRIC,FREEDMAN JEROME E;;GALLAGHER JOHN J;;PERRY MICHAEL S,MARTIN MARIETTA CORPORATION (1994-03-22);;LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION (1996-01-28);;GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY A CORP OF NY (1991-04-15),https://lens.org/152-677-035-014-75X,Granted Patent,yes,6,88,4,4,0,G01S7/032;;G01S7/032;;G01S13/22;;G01S13/22;;G01S13/426;;G01S13/426;;G01S13/91;;G01S13/91;;G01S2013/0254;;G01S2013/0254;;H01Q3/26;;H01Q3/26,G01S7/02;;G01S7/03;;G01S7/282;;G01S13/12;;G01S13/22;;G01S13/28;;G01S13/42;;G01S13/44;;G01S13/87;;G01S13/91;;G01S13/95;;H01Q3/26,342/158;;342/372,3,0,,,"Paper entitled Advanced Air Traffic Control Radar , by Jerome E.

An MS may access the UMAN via a wireless access point (AP) that is communicatively coupled to a UNC via an IP network. The URLC messages are sent between MSs and UNCs using an Up interface comprising a set of layered protocols over an underlying IP transport.

The system includes four separate active phased-array antennas, each with .+-.45.degree. coverage in azimuth, from 0.degree. to 60.degree. in elevation. Each antenna element of each phased-array antenna is coupled by a low-loss path to the solid-state amplifier associated with a transmit-receive (TR) module. Each antenna produces a sequence of pencil beams, which requires less transmitted power from the TR modules than a fan beam, but requires more time because the pencil beam must be sequenced to cover the same volume as the fan beam. In order to scan the volume in a short time, the PRF is responsive to the elevation angle of the beam, so higher elevation angles use a higher PRF. Low elevation angle beams receive long transmitter pulses for high power, and pulse compression is used to restore range resolution, but the long pulse results in a large minimum range within which targets cannot be detected. A second scan is provided at low elevation angles with a short transmitter pulse to fill in the short-range coverage. Beams at higher elevation angles transmit pulse widths which are shorter than beams at low elevation angles so that the minimum range requirement is met without a second scan, which also reduces the time required for volumetric scan. The number of pulses which are integrated to produce a return increases off-axis, to restore system margin lost due to off-axis power gain reduction. The volumetric scan rate is increased by a dynamic scan regimen by which subsets of beams are pulsed with a high transmitter PRF but with a low effective beam PRF to reduce range ambiguity and preserve Doppler resolution without the usual increase of scan time. For best range resolution, Doppler processing is used, with range sidelobe pulse suppression applied separately to each Doppler frequency bin.",GEN ELECTRIC,GALLAGHER JOHN J;;FREEDMAN JEROME E;;PERRY MICHAEL S,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION (1996-01-28);;GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY (1991-04-15),https://lens.org/184-715-262-536-086,Granted Patent,yes,6,66,1,1,0,G01S13/22;;G01S13/22;;G01S13/28;;G01S13/28;;G01S13/426;;G01S13/426;;G01S13/44;;G01S13/44;;G01S13/582;;G01S13/582;;G01S13/951;;G01S13/951;;H01Q21/0025;;H01Q21/0025;;Y02A90/10;;Y02A90/10,G01S13/22;;G01S13/28;;G01S13/42;;G01S13/44;;G01S13/58;;G01S13/95;;H01Q21/00,342/408;;342/376;;342/158,3,0,,,"Paper entitled Advanced Air Traffic Control Radar , by Jerome E.

The system includes four separate active phased-array antennas, each with ± 45° coverage in azimuth, from 0° to 60° in elevation. Each antema element of each phased-array antenna is coupled by a low-loss path to the solid-state amplifier associated with a transmit-receive (TR) module. Each antenna produces a sequence of pencil beams, which requires less transmitted power from the TR modules than a fan beam, but requires more time because the pencil beam must be sequenced to cover the same volume as the fan beam. In order to scan the volume in a short time, the PRF is responsive to the elevation angle of the beam, so higher elevation angles use a higher PRF. Low elevation angle beams receive long transmitter pulses for high power, and pulse compression is used to restore range resolution, but the long pulse results in a large minimum range within which targets cannot be detected. A second scan is provided at low elevation angles with a short transmitter pulse to fill in the short-range coverage. Beams at higher elevation angles transmit pulse widths which are shorter than beams at low elevation angles, so that the minimum range requirement is met without a second scan, which also reduces the time required for volumetric scan. The number of pulses which are integrated to produce a return increases off-axis, to restore system margin lost due to off-axis power gain reduction. The volumetric scan rate is increased by a dynamic scan regimen by which subsets of beams are pulsed with a high transmitter PRF but with a low effective beam PRF to reduce range ambiguity and preserve Doppler resolution without the usual increase of scan time. For best range resolution, Doppler processing is used, with range sidelobe pulse suppression applied separately to each Doppler frequency bin.",GEN ELECTRIC,FREEDMAN JEROME EDWIN;;PERRY MICHAEL STOCKUM;;GALLAGHER JOHN JAMES,,https://lens.org/155-341-433-229-078,Patent Application,yes,0,25,4,4,0,G01S7/032;;G01S7/032;;G01S13/22;;G01S13/22;;G01S13/426;;G01S13/426;;G01S13/91;;G01S13/91;;G01S2013/0254;;G01S2013/0254;;H01Q3/26;;H01Q3/26,G01S7/02;;G01S7/03;;G01S7/282;;G01S13/12;;G01S13/22;;G01S13/28;;G01S13/42;;G01S13/44;;G01S13/87;;G01S13/91;;G01S13/95;;H01Q3/26,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

In some embodiments, each access point operates using short range licensed wireless frequencies to establish a service region. In some embodiments, the network controller communicatively couples the core network to the plurality of access points. The method establishes, at a network controller, a bearer connection between an access point and the core network indicating an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) based bearer connection. The method also establishes an internet protocol (IP) based bearer connection. The method also establishes a user plane between the access point and the core network and routes user plane data to the core network through the ATM based bearer connection.",KHETAWAT AMIT;;TAO PATRICK;;GALLAGHER MICHAEL D;;GUPTA RAJEEV,KHETAWAT AMIT;;TAO PATRICK;;GALLAGHER MICHAEL D;;GUPTA RAJEEV,KINETO WIRELESS INC (2009-06-25),https://lens.org/015-627-768-723-526,Patent Application,yes,2,26,13,69,0,H04L63/104;;H04L2012/5607;;H04L2012/5656;;H04W8/16;;H04W12/08;;H04W36/0055;;H04W36/14;;H04W48/18;;H04W60/04;;H04W84/045;;H04W92/12;;H04W36/0066;;H04W76/32;;H04W76/12;;H04W12/73;;H04W12/72;;H04L51/222;;H04W92/12;;H04W84/045;;H04W8/16;;H04W12/08;;H04L63/104;;H04W36/14;;H04W60/04;;H04W48/18;;H04L2012/5656;;H04L2012/5607;;H04W36/0066;;H04W76/32;;H04W76/12;;H04W12/72;;H04W12/73;;H04L51/222,H04W4/00;;H04W36/00,370/331;;370/329,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   A diesel engine, having a plurality of individually controllable fuel injected cylinders, is operated in a skip firing mode to reduce smoke emissions during low power operation. The system senses certain identified engine operating parameters and when these parameters exceed predetermined thresholds for a predetermined time, then the skip firing is implemented. In another embodiment, it is possible to implement several different skip firing patterns dependent upon engine performance. Upon implementation of skip firing, the engine timing angle is reset by a fixed angle and a multiplication factor is included in the speed loop integrator to ensure that the appropriate fuel volume value is injected into each cylinder immediately upon initiation of skip firing. Skip firing is then disabled when another set of predetermined conditions is satisfied.

   A diesel locomotive includes a number of auxiliary subsystems operating in conjunction with the locomotive diesel engine and deriving their energy, from the diesel engine. Included among the subsystems are various cooling systems, the battery charging system, and the electrical generation system, comprising one or more alternators drivingly coupled to the engine shaft. Each of the subsystems includes a component that is activated when one or more operational conditions associated with the subsystem are met. For instance, an engine cooling system fan motor is activated when the coolant temperature exceeds a predetermined value. Similarly, a battery charger is activated when the battery voltage falls below a predetermined value, and an alternator blower is activated when the main or auxiliary alternator temperature exceeds a predetermined value. The activation of these power consuming auxiliary devices while the diesel engine is transitioning from a first load state to a higher load state, causes the formation of excessive smoke emissions. According to the present invention, the activation of these auxiliary components is delayed until the diesel engine has reached steady-state operation, after which the elements are activated as required. Also, in the event a subsystem operational parameter exceeds a predetermined critical limit, the auxiliary device is immediately activated, even if the diesel engine is in a transition state to a higher load value.

   A method of forming a motor vehicle instrument panel with a flexibly tethered air bag deployment door comprises the steps of molding an instrument panel with a first plastics material to a desired shape and with an integral air bag deployment door whose opening is defined by a tear seam formed by a groove molded in one side of the panel and with an integral mounting/hinge flange that extends from an inside surface of the door, and forming a bonded layer of second plastics material on one side of the flange and the inside surface of a potentially frangible portion of the door. The second plastics material has the physical characteristic of remaining ductile to a substantial degree at low temperatures substantial below the temperature at which the first plastics material becomes brittle and as a result the bonded layer forms a tether that connects the frangible door portion to the mounting/hinge flange in a flexible manner when this door portion breaks away from the flange because of embrittlement of the first plastics material at the low temperatures on tearing of the tear seam and opening movement of the door by an inflating air bag pressing against the inside surface of the frangible door portion.

The system includes four separate active phased-array antennas, each with .+-.45.degree. coverage in azimuth, from 0.degree. to 60.degree. in elevation. Each antenna element of each phased-array antenna is coupled by a low-loss path to the solid-state amplifier associated with a transmit-receive (TR) module. Each antenna produces a sequence of pencil beams, which requires less transmitted power from the TR modules than a fan beam, but requires more time because the pencil beam must be sequenced to cover the same volume as the fan beam. In order to scan the volume in a short time, the PRF is responsive to the elevation angle of the beam, so higher elevation angles use a higher PRF. Low elevation angle beams receive long transmitter pulses for high power, and pulse compression is used to restore range resolution, but the long pulse results in a large minimum range within which targets cannot be detected. A second scan is provided at low elevation angles with a short transmitter pulse to fill in the short-range coverage. Beams at higher elevation angles transmit pulse widths which are shorter than beams at low elevation angles, so that the minimum range requirement is met without a second scan, which also reduces the time required for volumetric scan. The number of pulses which are integrated to produce a return increases off-axis, to restore system margin lost due to off-axis power gain reduction. The volumetric scan rate is increased by a dynamic scan regimen by which subsets of beams are pulsed with a high transmitter PRF but with a low effective beam PRF to reduce range ambiguity and preserve Doppler resolution without the usual increase of scan time. For best range resolution, Doppler processing is used, with range sidelobe pulse suppression applied separately to each Doppler frequency bin.",GEN ELECTRIC,PERRY MICHAEL S;;FREEDMAN JEROME E;;GALLAGHER JOHN J,MARTIN MARIETTA CORPORATION (1994-03-22);;LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION (1996-01-28);;GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY (1991-04-15),https://lens.org/163-594-991-391-614,Granted Patent,yes,11,38,1,1,0,G01S13/44;;G01S13/44;;G01S7/282;;G01S7/282;;G01S13/22;;G01S13/22;;G01S13/282;;G01S13/282;;G01S13/426;;G01S13/426;;G01S13/5246;;G01S13/5246;;G01S13/66;;G01S13/66;;G01S13/87;;G01S13/87;;G01S2013/0254;;G01S2013/0254;;G01S2013/0272;;G01S2013/0272,G01S7/282;;G01S13/02;;G01S13/22;;G01S13/28;;G01S13/42;;G01S13/44;;G01S13/524;;G01S13/66;;G01S13/87,342/158;;342/81;;342/137,3,0,,,"Paper entitlted Advanced Air Traffic Control Radar , by Jerome E.

A common rail (20, 22) is disposed proximate each bank (20, 22) of cylinders (12) of the engine to provide high pressure fuel (30) to a fuel flow control apparatus (14) associated with each respective cylinder. A plurality of high-pressure fuel pumps (34) provides high-pressure fuel to at least one of the common rails. A fluid cross connection (38) is provided to convey high pressure fuel between the two common rails, thereby providing for the continued delivery of fuel to all cylinders in the event of a failure of one of the high pressure pumps. The high-pressure pumps are motivated by fuel lobes (64) located on camshaft sections (50a, 50b, 50c) adjoined at a gear driven end 58 of the camshaft (50).

Pre-straightening the wire before storing it in loops inside the cylindrical drum 34 allows for a more consistent pocket spring, and ultimately a flatter spring unit/mattress as any pre-stressing of the wire, caused by the drawing process used to manufacture it, is neutralised leaving the wire largely stress-free. This means that there is no need to compensate for, or break, the forces inherent in the wire before feeding it to the coiler.

I/O requests are queued by a requesting MPU in a memory shared with one or more IOPs. Each IOP is associated with a queue. Each IOP may continue processing queued I/O requests after completing processing on an earlier request. In addition, each MPU is associated with a queue shared with the IOPs. When an IOP completes processing of an I/O request, a completion message is added to the requesting MPU's queue and an interrupt is generated for that MPU. The MPU services all completion messages in its queue when the interrupt is processed. A threshold value is associated with each MPU queue. The threshold value indicates the minimum number of completed I/O requests required before an interrupt request is generated to the MPU. The threshold value for each MPU may be tuned to permit the computing system to balance the need for rapid I/O response time with the need for reduced interrupt overhead processing in the MPU. Various physical embodiments of the invention are disclosed wherein the queue is located in either a shared memory or in a register file. Additionally, various embodiments separate the queue used to store new I/O requests from the queue used to store completion messages while other embodiments merge the two queuing functions into a single queue where each entry contains an I/O request with a completion status field.",LSI LOGIC CORP,BINFORD CHARLES D;;GALLAGHER MICHAEL J;;MCCOMBS CRAIG C,AVAGO TECHNOLOGIES GENERAL IP (SINGAPORE) PTE.
