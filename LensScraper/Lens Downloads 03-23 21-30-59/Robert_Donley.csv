The usage information is maintained for each line of memory and indicates at least which node in the system stores a copy of which line of memory. The timing of the pushing is adaptive and configurable and biases the system to push updated copies of recently modified lines of memory to selected nodes before the processors associated therewith request the line. Other methods and devices for reducing memory access latencies in a multi-node multi-processor system carry out the steps of generating two-phase acknowledgments to invalidate commands wherein, after a phase I acknowledgment, a requesting processor is allowed to modify a line of memory before other processors in the system receive the invalidate. A temporary and process-transparent incoherency then occurs for that line, which is resolved by delaying all access requests to the modified line until phase II acknowledgements to the invalidate are received from all nodes sharing that line.

The usage information is maintained for each line of memory and indicates at least which node in the system stores a copy of which line of memory. The timing of the pushing is adaptive and configurable and biases the system to push updated copies of recently modified lines of memory to selected nodes before the processors associated therewith request the line. Other methods and devices for reducing memory access latencies in a multi-node multi-processor system carry out the steps of generating two-phase acknowledgments to invalidate commands wherein, after a phase I acknowledgment, a requesting processor is allowed to modify a line of memory before other processors in the system receive the invalidate. A temporary and process-transparent incoherency then occurs for that line, which is resolved by delaying all access requests to the modified line until phase II acknowledgements to the invalidate are received from all nodes sharing that line. The push-based method of filling the cache memories may be employed together with the two phase invalidate acknowledgment method, or may be employed separately therefrom.",NETWORK VIRTUAL SYSTEMS INC,AKKAWI ISAM;;DONLEY GREGGORY D;;QUINN ROBERT F,,https://lens.org/118-829-007-296-531,Search Report,yes,1,1,2,2,0,G06F12/0817;;G06F12/0813;;G06F2212/2542;;G06F2212/507,G06F12/08;;G06F12/0813;;G06F12/0817,,4,4,149-177-059-054-810;;038-985-031-653-126;;036-331-642-657-657;;027-692-697-111-00X,10.1109/2.121510;;10.1145/232974.232984;;10.1145/192007.192028;;10.1109/2.596630,"LENOSKI D ET AL: ""THE STANFORD DASH MULTIPROCESSOR"", COMPUTER,US,IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY, LONG BEACH., CA, US, vol. 25, no. 3, 1 March 1992 (1992-03-01), pages 63 - 79, XP000288291, ISSN: 0018-9162;;SAULSBURY A ET AL: ""MISSING THE MEMORY WALL: THE CASE FOR PROCESSOR/MEMORY INTEGRATION"", PROCEEDINGS OF THE ANNUAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE,US,NEW YORK, ACM/IEEE, vol.
