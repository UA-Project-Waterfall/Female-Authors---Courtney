In practice it has been found that such intermittent masking provides an immediate sense of relief, control and relaxation for the person,*whilst enabling sufficient perception of the tinnitus for habituation and long term treatment to occur. Advantageously the predetermined masking algorithm is specifically tailored to the audiometric configuration of the person.

CAM circuit 200 is comprised of configurable memory and is initially unprogrammed. Address requests are passed straight through multiplexer 201 to Read Only Memory (ROM) 202 . As a result the data in the data location in ROM 202 that corresponds to the requested address will be output to data bus 205 . If data locations in ROM 202 become defective or contain data that needs to be upgraded the circuit implements a remapping of the data location. CAM circuit 200 is programmed with direct addresses to be replaced in ROM 202 . The direct addresses are paired to emulation addresses of data locations in configurable memory 203 . Upgraded or substitute data is programmed into the configurable memory 203 at the paired emulation address. When address requests are received thereafter, CAM circuit 200 compares the address request to its stored direct addresses. If a match is found the paired emulation address is passed through multiplexer 201 instead of the direct address.

Both the pre-reduction of the catalyst and the hydrogenation of the phosphatide may be performed at 5 to 100 p.s.i.g. being preferably 45 p.s.i.g. and 15 p.s.i.a. respectively, and it is desirable to prevent contact of the catalyst with an oxidizing agent, e.g. air, between the two stages. The phosphatide may be pretreated with an acid, acid anhydride or a solvent comprising an alcohol to inhibit catalyst inactivation and, in general any solvent, or combination of solvents, in which the phosphatide is soluble but which will not inactivate the catalyst may be used for the reaction. It is desirable that such solvents should be removable under vacuum at temperatures lower than 95 DEG C. The phosphatide may also be bleached with an oxidizing agent, e.g. hydrogen peroxide, before or after hydrogenation in order to lighten the colour of the product. It is preferable to conduct the hydrogenation at below 70 DEG C. preferably 25 to 60 DEG C., and to filter off the catalyst at the end of the reaction after the addition of a filter acid. During this filtration the catalyst should be protected from oxygen and, in this connection, it is desirable to saturate the product solution with hydrogen or an inert gas, e.g. nitrogen, prior to filtration. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the product may be vacuum steam deodorized. Solutions of base, or aqueous suspensions of bases of limited water solubility, may be added to the product before or after deodorization to raise the aqueous pH to as high as 8.0, after which the water may be removed under vacuum. Numerous examples are given employing as the source of phosphatide commercial soybean lecithin, oil-free soybean phosphatides, alcohol-soluble or insoluble fractions of soybean phosphatides, peanut lecithin and com lecithin. The hydrogenated phosphatides obtained may be used as emulsifiers in the food and pharmaceutical industries (see Division A2).ALSO:Material obtained by the catalytic hydrogenation of phosphatide, e.g. lecithin, (see Division C2) is employed as an emulsifier in food preparations, such as ice-cream, cakes and biscuits.",CENTRAL SOYA CO,DAVIS PAUL FRANCIS,,https://lens.org/135-090-241-819-672,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,C07F9/103,C07F9/10,A2B BKE           BKE;;A2B B347          BKE;;A2B B391          BKE;;A2B B393          BKE;;C2P PA            -;;C2P P2E11A        -;;C2P P2E11B        -;;C2P P2E15A        -;;C2P P2E19B        -;;C2P P2E26B        -;;C2P P5A           -;;C2P P7            -;;C2P P9            -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Inc. 5 Feb., 1968, No. 5760/68. Heading B3V. [Also in Division B5] Apparatus for cutting an elongated sheet metal pipe 9 moving at a predetermined rate along a path extending longitudinally of the pipe and rotating about its axis comprises a carriage 16 supported for movement parallel to the path and driven at the same predetermined speed by driving means 12, cutting means 20, such as a saw blade or torch, carried by the carriage for movement transverse to the path into and out of cutting relation to the wall of the path, and means responsive to the movement of the carriage past a first point for moving the cutting means into cutting relation for at least one complete revolution of the pipe and past a second point spaced from the first point a fixed distance for moving the cutting means out of cutting relation. As described, the cutting means consists of a saw blade. The carriage 16 is reciprocated parallel to the path of the pipe along rails 8 by a chain drive 13 from a motor 12. The saw blade 20 is mounted on a shaft 26 supported in bearings 31 on a plate 11 which is slidable along rods 27 in a direction parallel to the path of the pipe, the rods being mounted on a plate 24. The movement of the saw relative to plate 24 permits floating of the saw during cutting to accommodate differences in the speeds of the pipe and carriage. The movement of plate 11 is against springs which urge plate 11 to a central position in which the plate can be releasably held by a solenoid-operated mechanism 40 during movement of the blade 20 into cutting engagement with the pipe. The plate 24 is carried by arms 18 supported on pivots 22 on the carriage 16 and is movable about the pivots by a hydraulic unit 25 to move the saw into and out of cutting engagement with the pipe. The operation of the machine is controlled by a selected one of limit switches L7A, L7B, L7C engageable by the pipe as it issues from a pipe forming machine and by limit switches L2, L3, L5, L6 operable by a dog 67 on the carriage 16. In operation, actuation of the selected switch, say L7A, by the free end of the pipe 9, starts the forward movement of carriage 16 by energizing motor 12. Limit switch L6 is then actuated to cause solenoid 40 to release the plates 11, 24 together to permit floating of the saw and actuates cylinder 25 to move the saw into engagement with the pipe. If during sawing, the speeds the pipe and carriage differ, plate 11 moves relative to plate 24 and a pinion associated with plate 24 is rotated by a rack on plate 11 to alter a potentiometer 65, 66, the varying voltage, which can be observed on a motor 63, being observed by the operator or used automatically to vary the speed of the carriage so that it matches the speed of the pipe. After the pipe is cut, switch L5 is actuated to cause cylinder 25 to retract the saw and solenoid 40 to lock the plates 11, 24 together. Thereafter switch 43 is actuated to effect return of the carriage to its initial position. During sawing, the pipe is supported by a structure 14 on the carriage and run-out tables 15 which are joined together by beams 79 and are movable by a cylinder 74 at a faster speed than that of the pipe so as to separate a cutpiece from a following piece. Each table 15 has a V-shaped frame 89 which is rockable about a pivot 81 in one direction or the other by cylinders 97, 98, the arms of the V carrying adjustably-spaced rollers 93 for supporting the pipe. The structure 14 is of similar construction to the tables 15. After severing of the pipe, the cylinder 74 moves the cut-piece at a faster speed and a selected cylinder 97 or 98 is actuated to rock the frames 89 in one direction or the other to eject the cut-piece.",PACIFIC ROLLER DIE COMPANY INC,DAVIS PAUL KNIGHT,,https://lens.org/153-885-660-009-078,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,B23D45/124;;B23D45/20,B23D45/12;;B23D45/18;;B23D45/20,B3V V4BX          -;;B5L LCC           LCC;;B5L L102          LCC;;B5L L106          LCC;;B5L L11           -;;B5L L2            -;;B5L L5A           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A tinnitus method and device for providing relief to a person suffering from the disturbing effects of tinnitus is described. The method can be implemented entirely in software to spectrally modify an audio signal in accordance with a predetermined masking algorithm which modifies the intensity of the audio signal at selected frequencies. A predetermined masking algorithm is described which provides intermittent masking of the tinnitus wherein, at a comfortable listening level, during peaks of the audio signal the tinnitus is completely obscured, whereas during troughs the perception of the tinnitus occasionally emerges. In practice it has been found that such intermittent masking provides an immediate sense of relief, control and relaxation for the person, whilst enabling sufficient perception of the tinnitus for habituation and long term treatment to occur. Advantageously the predetermined masking algorithm is specifically tailored to the audiometric configuration of the person. For example, the masking algorithm may be partly tailored to the hearing loss characteristic of the person. A tinnitus rehabilitation device used in conjunction with a personal sound reproducing system is also described.

The method can be implemented entirely in software to 5 spectrally modify an audio signal in accordance with a predetermined masking algorithm which modifies the intensity of the audio signal at selected frequencies. A predetermined masking algorithm is described which provides intermittent masking of the tinnitus wherein, at a comfortable listening level, during peaks of the audio signal the tinnitus is completely obscured, whereas during troughs the perception of the tinnitus occasionally 10 emerges. In practice it has been found that such intermittent masking provides an immediate sense of relief, control and relaxation for the person, whilst enabling sufficient perception of the tinnitus for habituation and long term treatment to occur. Advantageously the predetermined masking algorithm is specifically tailored to the audiometric configuration of the person. For example, the masking algorithm may be 15 partly tailored to the hearing loss characteristic of the person.

A predetermined masking algorithm provides intermittent masking of the tinnitus wherein, at a comfortable listening level, during peaks of the audio signal the tinnitus is completely obscured, whereas during troughs the perception of the tinnitus occasionally emerges. Such intermittent masking provides an immediate sense of relief, control and relaxation for the person, whilst enabling sufficient perception of the tinnitus for habituation and long term treatment to occur. Advantageously the predetermined masking algorithm is specifically tailored to the audiometric configuration of the person. For example, the masking algorithm may be partly tailored to the hearing loss characteristic of the person. <P>COPYRIGHT: (C)2005,JPO&NCIPI",UNIV CURTIN TECH,DAVIS PAUL BENJAMIN,,https://lens.org/055-116-343-275-12X,Patent Application,no,0,6,34,36,0,A61B5/121;;A61B5/128;;H04R25/505;;H04R25/75;;A61B5/411;;A61B5/121;;A61B5/128;;H04R25/505;;H04R25/75;;A61B5/411,A61B5/12;;A61F11/00;;H04R25/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Ltd. Sept. 10, 1964 [Sept. 10, 1963], No. 35683/63. Heading H3B. A magnetic information storage device consists of a stationary thin film of ferromagnetic material on a non-magnetic backing member, the film being capable of existing as a single magnetic domain in the absence of an applied magnetic field, recording means for creating a plurality of domain boundaries in the film, driving means for causing the boundaries to move along the film, and reading means responsive to the presence of domain boundaries adjacent thereto. The film is formed with a plurality of zones 15. When a domain boundary 18 is created by the recording means it is transferred from zone to zone by an alternating magnetic field, the strength of which is sufficient to drive the boundary from the wide end of one zone to the narrow end of the next but insufficient to return it on the opposite halfcycle. The period of each cycle of the driving field, the field strength and the zone length are selected so that a boundary moves a distance greater than the length of a zone during a halfcycle. The rate of operation is such that there is one domain boundary to every consecutive pair of zones. The information may be erased by weakening the driving field to allow the boundaries to catch up with each other than applying a strong field to annihilate the boundaries. In a modification, the film has straight edges but contains rows of triangular holes. In Fig. 4 (not shown), two paths as in Fig. 2 join with a third similar path. Information from either of the first paths cannot alone enter the third path, but the boundaries in the first two paths together can combine at the junction and continue as one boundary. Such an arrangement may be used in a binary adder. The reading means in each case may be an electrical device or may use polarized light to detect the boundaries. The storage device may be a flat strip or may form a circumferential or helical path on a drum.

The method can be implement ed entirely in software to spectrally modify an audio signal in accordance with a predetermined masking algorithm which modifies the intensity of the audio signal at selected frequencies. A predetermined masking algorithm is describ ed which provides intermittent masking of the tinnitus wherein, at a comfortabl e listening level, during peaks of the audio signal the tinnitus is completely obscured, whereas during troughs the perception of the tinnitus occasionally emerges. In practice it has been found that such intermittent masking provid es an immediate sense of relief, control and relaxation for the person, whilst enabling sufficient perception of the tinnitus for habituation and long term treatment to occur. Advantageously the predetermined masking algorithm is specifically tailored to the audiometric configuration of the person. For example, the masking algorithm may be partly tailored to the hearing loss characteristic of the person.

Each block of less configurable memory contains an address segment 203 and a data segment 204 . Address segment 203 refers to a specific cell in directly accessible memory 209 . When the data in directly accessible memory 209 needs to be refreshed arbiter 206 will cycle through the stack of less configurable memory. For each block in the stack, arbiter 206 will load data segment 204 into the cell in directly accessible memory block 207 that has a corresponding address to the address stored in address segment 203 . Since arbiter 206 moves down the stack sequentially, blocks that have redundant addresses will effectively rewrite the data stored in a preceding block. The result is an inexpensive NVM with rewrite functionality.",ZEROG WIRELESS INC DELAWARE CO,DAVIS PAUL G,ZEROG WIRELESS INC (2007-11-21);;MICROCHIP TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED (2010-05-12);;AZ1 ACQUISITION CORPORATION (2010-01-08),https://lens.org/070-784-856-251-112,Patent Application,yes,17,12,1,1,0,G06F11/1008;;G06F12/0638;;G06F11/1008;;G06F12/0638,G06F11/10;;G06F12/02,711/103;;714/812;;X711E12008;;X714E11006,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The lock member in the locked position interferes with movement of the cylinder. A power source is connected to the locking mechanism in response to the signal. The locking mechanism allows movement of the lock member from the locked position to the open position in response to the signal so that the cylinder may be rotated within the shell. The cylinder further includes an interfering member that resists movement of the locking member.

    An electronic locking system comprises a cylinder housed within and rotatable with respect to a shell. A key has a power supply. At least one of the key and the cylinder is capable of generating a signal when the key is electrically connected with the cylinder. An electrically powered locking mechanism is housed within the cylinder and includes a lock member moveable between an open position and a locked position. The lock member in the locked position interferes with movement of the cylinder. A power source is connected to the locking mechanism in response to the signal. The locking mechanism allows movement of the lock member from the locked position to the open position in response to the signal so that the cylinder may be rotated within the shell. The cylinder further includes an interfering member that resists movement of the locking member. In addition, a biasing mechanism urges the cylinder toward a home position when the cylinder is rotated away from the home position.

    The present invention relates to building structures that are floatable so that damage is reduced in the event of a flood. A sealed floor structure is described such that the entire superstructure can float under the influence of flood waters. The floor structure is supported above grade upon corbels and thence by a series of columns disposed around the perimeter of the building. The perimeter columns generally lie outside the superstructure envelope and continue up to or beyond the eaves level of the structure. As the building floats vertically these columns, via a sleeve mechanism, act to limit any horizontal movement of the structure. Mechanisms incorporated within the columns and floor structure limit the upward travel of the structure under the influence of flood waters.

A predetermined masking algorithm is described which provides intermittent masking of the tinnitus wherein, at a comfortable listening level, during peaks of the audio signal the tinnitus is completely obscured, whereas during troughs the perception of the tinnitus occasionally emerges. In practice it has been found that such intermittent masking provides an immediate sense of relief, control and relaxation for the person, whilst enabling sufficient perception of the tinnitus for habituation and long term treatment to occur.

A new technique is provided to shape the data traffic profile in order to maximise the efficiency of the bandwidth reservation scheme whilst guaranteeing a defined quality of service in terms of data loss and delay. The shaper, called the Fast Bandwidth Reservation Shaper (FBRS), is essentially a FIFO buffer with three thresholds (T1-T3), a server and an FRP control function which monitors the state of the queue and its associated thresholds, alters the service rate of the server and handles the FRP protocol. By careful choice of the three thresholds and service rates, the FBRS can improve the efficiency of fast bandwidth allocation schemes by reducing the peak bitrate and increasing the duration of small data bursts and by guaranteeing a minimum burst duration, for all but the smallest data bursts, that is in excess of the round trip delay.",ROKE MANOR RESEARCH,DAVIS SIMON PAUL,,https://lens.org/011-935-624-047-169,Patent Application,yes,0,36,7,7,0,H04L12/5602;;H04L47/29;;H04L47/30;;H04L2012/5634;;H04L2012/5636;;H04Q11/0478;;H04Q11/0478;;H04L2012/5636;;H04L2012/5634;;H04L12/5602;;H04L47/29;;H04L47/30,H04L12/56;;H04Q11/04,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

At least one of the key and the cylinder is capable of generating a signal when the key is electrically connected with the cylinder. An electrically powered locking mechanism is housed within the cylinder and includes a lock member moveable between an open position and a locked position. The lock member in the locked position interferes with movement of the cylinder. A power source is connected to the locking mechanism in response to the signal. The locking mechanism allows movement of the lock member from the locked position to the open position in response to the signal so that the cylinder may be rotated within the shell. The cylinder further includes an interfering member that resists movement of the locking member. In addition, a biasing mechanism urges the cylinder toward a home position when the cylinder is rotated away from the home position.

An apparatus for making helically seamed tubes from metal strip 2 comprises a series of rolls 36, 37, 38 which forms the strips into helical convolutions the edges of which can be joined to form the tube. Strips from a coil 20 passes between corrugating rolls 8 and flanges 29 are formed on the edges of the strips by rollers 30, 91. The strip is formed into helical convolutions by rolls 36, 37, 38, engaging the flanges 29 together which are then flattened by rollers 46f and a crimping wheel 75, to form a lock seam. The rolls 36, 37, 38 are mounted on a frame 35 which is attached to the carriage 3 of the apparatus by a pivot pin 41 which enables the helix angle to be varied to suit different widths of strip. The rolls 36, 37, 38 each comprise wheels or rollers 46, which are mounted in yokes 48, attached to plates 49, which are linked together by connectors 50 and which can be moved laterally across the strip and pivoted to suit the angle and position of the corrugations. Screws 63, 66 are provided to make this adjustment. The diameter of the pipe formed is varied by altering the difference in vertical height of rolls 36 and 37. The pitch of the corrugation is determined by the separation of rollers 9 by means of spacers 11, provided between the rollers 9.

    A tinnitus method and device for providing relief to a person suffering from the disturbing effects of tinnitus is described. The method can be implemented entirely in software to spectrally modify an audio signal in accordance with a predetermined masking algorithm which modifies the intensity of the audio signal at selected frequencies. A predetermined masking algorithm is described which provides intermittent masking of the tinnitus wherein, at a comfortable listening level, during peaks of the audio signal the tinnitus is completely obscured, whereas during troughs the perception of the tinnitus occasionally emerges. In practice it has been found that such intermittent masking provides an immediate sense of relief, control and relaxation for the person, whilst enabling sufficient perception of the tinnitus for habituation and long term treatment to occur. Advantageously the predetermined masking algorithm is specifically tailored to the audiometric configuration of the person. For example, the masking algorithm may be partly tailored to the hearing loss characteristic of the person. A tinnitus rehabilitation device used in conjunction with a personal sound reproducing system is also described.

The system includes an inverter 110 having inverter control inputs 142 , power outputs 114 coupled to an AC load 116, and power inputs 120/118 coupled to DC supply rails 102/104. There is a Core Balance Current Transformer CBCT or zero sequence current transformer ZSCT 122 positioned to detect zero sequence currents flowing between the power outputs 114 and the AC load 124/116. In operation, the Core Balance Current Transformer 122 provides an inverter output monitoring signal 136 indicative of the zero sequence currents (ZSC). The system includes a variable voltage drive controller 148 that has a memory module 134 storing an inverter profile instruction set that includes instructions for producing a discrete RMS voltage level at the power outputs. The inverter profile instruction set also includes a zero sequence (current) threshold value (ZTV) representing a zero sequence current threshold level assigned to each discrete RMS voltage level. There is also a processor module 132 coupled to the memory module 134. The processor module has a least one zero sequence current processing input coupled to the Core Balance Current Transformer, and inverter control outputs are coupled to the inverter control inputs. In operation, the processor module provides control signals at the inverter control outputs to thereby vary the RMS voltage level at the power outputs of the inverter (figure 3). For a selected discrete RMS voltage level, the processor module generates an earth fault signal only when a zero sequence current signal resulting from processing the inverter output monitoring signal, exceeds the zero sequence current threshold value assigned to the selected discrete RMS voltage level (340 figure 3).

The docking station also incorporates means for receiving a test substrate comprising a sample from a tissue wound. The docking station also includes means for docking a sensor in the station, which sensor detects the light reflected from an illuminated tissue wound, such that an image of the tissue wound can be communicated from the station to the processor. The means for docking is arranged such that when the sensor is docked in the station and the test substrate is received by the docking station, the sensor is positioned to detect the intensity of reflected light from the test substrate and communicates the detected intensity of reflected light to the processor to thus permit combined imaging of the tissue wound and test substrate. An apparatus for use in combined imaging of a tissue wound and a test substrate comprising a sample from a tissue wound, comprises such a docking station together with a sensor which detects the light reflected from a tissue wound and test substrate when illuminated and a test substrate for receiving a sample from a tissue wound. A method of imaging a wound comprises directing light over a wavelength range of less than 50nm onto the wound (9). The light reflected from the wound (9) is detected with a sensor (5) that is sensitive to the intensity of the reflected light.

This knuckle has been designed primarily for use on a Metal Detector and addresses three common problems encountered when using a Metal Detector. ) The Coil Cable Clips commonly used on the lower shaft of a detector have a tendency to rotate in use because of the force exerted on them by the wound cable. This problem is alleviated by winding the cable around the curved cable retainer section of the Multi Purpose Knuckle ( see top left of drawing ) which gives a solid anchoring point that removes any rotational force produced by the cable If the cable that runs from the detector coil to the control box is not adequately restrained along the top shaft of the detector, it will cause electronic noise that detracts from its performance. This problem is also solved by the use of the curved Cable retainer section. With this addition the cable can now be effectively wound around the top shaft as there is a fixed point that will not allow cable to rotate. ) When using a detector the operators arm can quickly tire from the repetitive action. This can be alleviated by the use of a control arm or auxiliary handle which is held in the other hand. The knuckle provides a convenient point for attaching an auxiliary handle.It has been designed with a gap between its two sides that is large enough to accommodate a substantial auxiliary handle and a Thumbscrew capable of retaining it.

In embodiments, fragrance aroma chemicals are delivered from a fragrance oil containing pod or cartridge by applying direct heat to said pod. Upon a particular temperature (or temperature range) being reached, the pod releases fragrance at a desired intensity. The heated pod releases fragrance at a cooler temperature as compared to traditional wax systems, traditional plug-in devices, and/or traditional diffusers. As such, the heater devices of the systems disclosed herein operate at a cooler temperature as compared to traditional fragrance systems. The comparatively cooler temperature makes the devices disclosed herein more energy efficient than traditional fragrance systems. In addition, the pods themselves are more efficient and utilize less fragrance as compared to traditional fragrance systems. Moreover, this device is designed to cycle warmer/cooler temperatures at programmed times. This temperature cycle fluctuates the amount of fragrance released, preventing the oversaturation of fragrance into the environment. This prevention of oversaturation is crucial for preventing human anosmia (e.g., the fragrance is no longer noticeable to the user due to overexposure).",AROMAIR FINE FRAGRANCE COMPANY,DAVIS JASON PAUL;;MOROSOV IRINA,,https://lens.org/094-149-251-110-120,Patent Application,yes,5,1,2,2,0,A61L2209/111;;A61L2209/133;;A61L9/032;;A61L9/03;;A61L9/035;;A61L9/032;;A61L2209/111;;A61L2209/133,A61L9/12;;A61L9/03;;A61Q13/00;;F21S45/60;;G01N7/14;;G01N7/16;;G05B21/02,,0,0,,,,PENDING

   A shoe sole is described that provides both cushioning and stability. The sole has a plurality of layers, including a transition layer which allows relative motion between the layers adjacent to the transition layer. The relative motion between the layers of the sole reduces the impact of horizontal shear stresses on the wearer's feet and ankles. One such transition layer includes pliable material and deformable holes within the pliable material. Another transition layer includes at least two rigid plates held together by less rigid grommets or sidewalls. The transition layer may be disposed beneath the entire shoe or only portions of the shoe, with either a more conventional sole structure or rigid support members completing the sole.

Each terabit router has a plurality of ingress line interface cards (210, 212, 214, 216), a plurality of egress line interface cards (220, 222, 224, 226) and a cell based cross-bar (202). Each ingress card has a plurality of queues, a different queue for each of the egress cards respectively. The cross-bar (202) is controlled by a cross-bar controller (204) in association with a bandwidth controller (206). In operation, a target rate matrix is maintained over a set period. At the beginning of each period, a matrix of numbers of cells queued to be transmitted is calculated in accordance with the target rate. For each successive cell slot within the period, a configuration is found which matches the cell number matrix by servicing only queues which have non-zero cell counts.

    The invention relates to a switching device ( 300 ) having a plurality of line interface cards (LICs) ( 310 ), a plurality of egress LICs ( 320 ), a cross-bar ( 330 ) and a management card ( 340 ). The switching device ( 300 ) routes fixed sized cells of data across the cross-bar ( 330 ). The cells comprise fragments of variable length data packets. Each ingress LIC ( 312, 314, 316 ) is associated with a respective schedule or timetable ( 362, 364, 366 ) governing the transmission of cells by the ingress LIC. Similarly, each egress LIC ( 322, 324, 326 ) is also associated with a respective schedule or timetable ( 382, 384, 386 ) governing the reception of cells by said egress LIC. The schedules are in the form of a table whose entries are the identities of transmission queues corresponding to a respective egress LIC identification number (for ingress LICs) and ingress LICs from which to receive (egress LICs). Each ingress and egress LIC maintains a pointer into its associated schedule. At each cell transmit time, each ingress LIC transmits a cell from the queue identified by the pointer and each egress LIC will receive the cell from the ingress LIC identified in the entry referenced by the pointer. The pointers then move to the next location. Each schedule is circular in the sense that when moving the pointer from the last entry, its next position is the first entry.

Upon a particular temperature (or temperature range) being reached, the pod releases fragrance at a desired intensity. The heated pod releases fragrance at a cooler temperature as compared to traditional wax systems, traditional plug-in devices, and/or traditional diffusers. As such, the heater devices of the systems disclosed herein operate at a cooler temperature as compared to traditional fragrance systems. The comparatively cooler temperature makes the devices disclosed herein more energy efficient than traditional fragrance systems. In addition, the pods themselves are more efficient and utilize less fragrance as compared to traditional fragrance systems. Moreover, this device is designed to cycle warmer/cooler temperatures at programmed times. This temperature cycle fluctuates the amount of fragrance released, preventing the oversaturation of fragrance into the environment. This prevention of oversaturation is crucial for preventing human anosmia (e.g., the fragrance is no longer noticeable to the user due to overexposure).",AROMAIR FINE FRAGRANCE COMPANY,DAVIS JASON PAUL;;MOROSOV IRINA,AROMAIR FINE FRAGRANCE COMPANY (2017-10-23),https://lens.org/123-978-200-675-154,Patent Application,yes,11,6,2,2,0,A61L2209/111;;A61L2209/133;;A61L9/032;;A61L9/03;;A61L9/035;;A61L9/032;;A61L2209/111;;A61L2209/133,A61L9/03,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The testing apparatus 8 is disposed below a steel strip 5 from a hot strip mill and includes an H-shaped magnetic core 10 mounted in a chamber 12 through which cooling water flows. A field winding 18 energized from A.C. source 30 produces an alternating flux passing through strip 5 via feet 38. The flux is modified by the magnetic properties of the metal strip 5 and causes a voltage VI to be generated across coils 22, 24 wound so that equal fluxes passing through the parts of the upright 26 from cross bar 20 produce a zero voltage across terminals 29. V 1 is integrated in box 40 to produce a signal representative of the magnetic induction B and a signal V 2 represented of the field H produced by coil 18 is developed across resistor 34. B, H, Hc, Br, Bm and Á are obtained from the computer 40 and the hysteresis loops calculated, they may be displayed on an oscilloscope. Various graphs of Bm, Br, dBm/dt dBr/dt versus temperature, H, B versus time and phase diagrams for various cooling rates are described Figs. 4-8 (not shown) from which phase transformation and temperature of the strip 5 can be deduced and signals obtained to control the cooling of the strip to produce a particular phase of the material of the metal strip.",BRITISH IRON STEEL RESEARCH,DAVIS NORMAN;;NORRIS PAUL ALFRED,,https://lens.org/083-619-579-843-277,Granted Patent,no,0,11,1,1,0,G01K7/36;;G01R33/14,G01K7/36;;G01R33/14,G1N NCCJ          CCJ;;G1N N19B2C        CCJ;;G1N N19D7         CCJ;;G1N N19F3         CCJ;;G1N N19F7D1       CCJ;;G1N N19F7D2       CCJ;;G1N N19HX         CCJ;;G1N N19H12        CCJ;;G1N N19H14        CCJ;;G1N N19X6         CCJ;;G1N N40X          F6(4;;G1N N406          F6(4;;G1N N408          F6(4;;G1N N412          F6(4;;G1N N413          F6(4;;G1N N422          F6(4;;G1N N431          F6(4;;G1N N461          F6(4;;G1N N463          F6(4,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In another aspect, the invention comprises delayed decode of breakpoint instructions within the core so as to remove critical path restrictions in the pipeline. In yet another aspect, the invention comprises a multi-function register disposed in the pipeline logic, the register including a bypass mode adapted to selectively bypass or shortcut subsequent logic, and return the result of a multi-cycle operation directly to a subsequent instruction requiring the result. Improved data cache integration and operation techniques, and apparatus for synthesizing logic implementing the aforementioned methodology are also disclosed.
