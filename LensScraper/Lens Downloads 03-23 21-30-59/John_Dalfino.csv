The present disclosure provides dynamic cranial fixation devices and related methods that provide outward movement of the bone flap as the brain swells underneath the bone flap to prevent or reduce a rise in the intracranial pressure. Once the brain swelling resolves, the dynamic cranial fixation devices and related methods of the present disclosure allow the bone flap to return to its original position (before resection) without further surgery, implantation or the like. Once the bone flap return to its original position (or substantially similar position), the bone flap may fuse with the neighboring bone(s), potentially with the assistance of one or more fusion aid.",ALBANY MEDICAL COLLEGE,DIRISIO DARRYL J;;SHAIKH PARVEZ MEMET;;DALFINO JOHN C,ALBANY MEDICAL COLLEGE (2020-03-30),https://lens.org/157-814-613-845-425,Granted Patent,yes,57,0,3,3,0,A61B17/688;;A61B17/688;;A61B17/80;;A61B17/8023;;A61B17/8023;;A61B17/8061;;A61B17/8061;;A61B17/8085;;A61B17/8085;;A61B2017/681,A61B17/68;;A61B17/80,,1,0,,,"International Search Report and Written Opinion issued in PCT Application PCT/US2014/040500 dated Oct. 23, 2014.",ACTIVE
