Initially, the obtention of PB is performed by the selective polymerization of butadiene in the presence of styrene (St) as a solvent, by means of a catalytic system based on neodymium. Subsequently, the resulting solution of PB/St is added with different reagents established in an ABS recipe and are polymerized by free radicals, where the characteristics will depend on the macro and microstructure of the PB obtained in the first step.",CT DE INVESTIG EN QUIMICA APLICADA,REGALADO ENRIQUE JAVIER JIMENEZ;;GOMEZ RAMON ENRIQUE DIAZ DE LEON;;CARRIZALES RICARDO MENDOZA;;GAMEZ JOSE FRANCISCO HERNANDEZ;;MARTINEZ PATRICIA ADRIANA DE LEON;;IBARRA GABRIELA BOSQUES;;MEDRANO FRANCISCO JAVIER ENRIQUEZ;;CORRAL FLORENTINO SORIANO,,https://lens.org/103-592-345-273-407,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,C08L55/02;;C08F279/04;;C08L51/04,,0,0,,,,PENDING

This process consists of two stages: In the first stage, two concentrates are processed through an extrusion process, a concentrate comprising 46% by weight additives (azodicarbonamide, zinc oxide, peroxide and silicon dioxide), plus the ethylene-co-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer; the second concentrate is made up of agave fiber at 30% by weight and the ethylene-co-vinyl acetate copolymer. In the second stage, the sheet or preform is produced by the continuous extrusion process, using the concentrates of the first stage, which are diluted and mixed with the low density polyethylene polymers of and the ethylene-co-vinyl acetate copolymer. This way, agave fiber rectangular sheets or preforms are obtained at a concentration of 3 to 9% by weight. This preform can be cut in certain sizes or coiled to be foamed later; the st orage or shelf life of this preform can be of up to 9 months.",CENTRO DE INVESTIGACION EN QUIM APLICADA,CARLOS ALBERTO AVILA ORTA;;PABLO GONZALEZ MORONES;;RAMON ENRIQUE DIAZ DE LEON GOMEZ;;FLORENTINO SORIANO CORRAL;;MARCELA AIDE ZAMARRON PONCE;;JUAN FRANCISCO ZENDEJO RODRIGUEZ;;OLIVERIO SANTIAGO RODRIGUEZ FERNANDEZ;;JOSE FRANCISCO HERNANDEZ GAMEZ;;MYRIAM LOZANO ESTRADA;;LUIS ANTONIO CALVA NAVA;;ERNESTO HERNÁNDEZ HERNÁNDEZ,,https://lens.org/149-814-916-322-04X,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,C08J9/00;;B29C48/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING
