The modeling method uses a computer to select discrete values for resistive and capacitive loads to be connected to the secondary of a transformer. For each combination of resistive and capacitive load connected to the secondary, the circuit is measured for phase angle. This data is used by the computer software to predict the tuning of the transformer to a load combination that is not actually connected to the transformer. This is done by determining two load lines for actual values of resistance and capacitance connected to the transformer secondary and then interpolating between the two load lines using a logarithmic equation. An option provided to the operator is to specify the value of the load capacitance or not. If the load capacitance is specified, the computer computes the phase angle for that value of load capacitance. If the load capacitance is not specified, the computer computes the value of capacitance with will produce a zero phase angle.",HONEYWELL INC,DAVIS JOHN,HONEYWELL INC.

A vehicle skid-sensing means and brakereleaser comprises a first speed-responsive governor-type mechanism adapted to rotate synchronously with a member rotating at a speed proportional to a wheel speed, and a second speed-responsive governor-type mechanism driven by the member independently of the first mechanism, the first mechanism releasing the brakes via a control element whenever the first mechanism is rotating at or below a certain critical speed, provided that at the same time the second mechanism is rotating at a speed greater than its own critical speed (the second critical speed being greater than the first critical speed); the second governor-type mechanism comprises means to render the first mechanism ineffective at vehicle speeds below a predetermined value. As shown, an axially-fixed but rotatable shaft 44 is driven at a rate proportional to the rate of rotation of a vehicle wheel. It has pivoted to it by ball ends 51 in sockets 52 the limbs 50 of a number of weights 47 constituting a first governor-type mechanism 45.

The sleeve 49 has an annular lip 62 at its righthand end, which may be engaged by latches 63 on a second governor-type mechanism 46 to be described. The shaft 44 has another sleeve 59 keyed to it, and to this sleeve is keyed, in turn, a friction ring 58 urged by a spring 60 into contact with a ring 55 journalled on ball bearings around shaft 49. To the ring 55 are pivoted the arms 57 of the weights 56 of the second mechanism, and these arms are urged radially inwards by leaf springs 64, and embody the latches 63. Leftward movement of sleeve 49 serves to move a push rod 53 which effects operation of a control valve to release the wheel brake, either by applying a counter pressure to the brakeapplying pressure, or by reducing or preventing fluid flow to the brake and releasing fluid therefrom. In operation, at low vehicle speeds, the second mechanism 46 remains collapsed, thus latching the sleeve 49 against leftward movement; the valve is consequently inoperative, and the wheel brake cannot be released by the skid-sensing means. Hence low-speed manoeuvring of the vehicle with normal braking is permitted. For vehicle speeds at which skidding would be dangerous, (e.g. above 10 m.p.h.), the rate of rotation of shaft 44 is such that both mechanisms are in fly-out position. Should there be locking of the associated wheel, the shaft 44 would come suddenly to rest, and the first mechanism would collapse to operate the valve and cause brake release. Meanwhile the rotational inertia of the second mechanism 46 would cause it to continue rotating for a time against the resistance of the friction ring 58, and by the time it collapsed, the sleeve 49 would already be axially displaced, and the latches 63 would not engage the lip 62, so the valve would remain operative. If on the other hand (again from speeds e.g. above 10 m.p.h.), the shaft 44 slows to rest at the uniform rate associated with a non-skid stop, the second mechanism 46 slows with the shaft 44 under the influence of the friction ring 58. Because of the leaf springs 64 acting on it, the second governor 46 collapses before the first governor 45 would, and thus latches the sleeve 49 before the first governor 45 can move it to the left. Thus the brake cannot be released in this situation. But any resulting loss of directional stability is unimportant as the vehicle stops before getting out of control.",DUNLOP HOLDINGS LTD,DAVIS JOHN WALTER,,https://lens.org/002-311-193-232-204,Granted Patent,no,0,4,4,4,0,B60T8/74;;Y10T137/0989;;Y10T137/1026;;Y10T137/0989;;Y10T137/1026;;B60T8/74,B60T8/72;;B60T8/74,F2F FC            FCZ;;F2F F1A1B2D       F1Z;;F2F F1B8X         F1Z;;F2F F1B9X         F1Z;;F2F F200          F3(C;;F2F F226          F3(C;;F2F F228          F3(C;;F2F F248          F3(C;;F2F F258          F3(C;;F2F F262          F3(C;;F2F F334          F3(C;;F2F F382          F3(C;;F2F F394          F3(C;;F2F F458          F3(C;;F2F F611          FCZ;;F2F F645          FCZ;;F2F F69X          FCZ,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In the preferred machine, absorbent wicks are used to transfer lane dressing from a reservoir to an applicator assembly. Lane dressing is recycled through an overflow in the reservoir to maintain a constant level and thereby maintaining a constant transfer rate through the wicks. The preferred machine also includes a cleaning assembly for applying a cleaning liquid to the lane and removing the liquid into a spent liquid storage tank. A vacuum pump induces air flow through the cleaning assembly for removing spent cleaning liquid which subjects the liquid in the tank to foaming. A controller stops the vacuum pump for a selected time in order to allow the foam to settle and then restarts the pump.",KEGEL COMPANY INC,DAVIS JOHN M,KEGEL LLC (2003-09-30),https://lens.org/095-236-806-213-070,Granted Patent,yes,23,16,2,3,0,A47L11/4011;;A47L11/4011;;A47L11/03;;A47L11/03;;A47L11/10;;A47L11/10;;A47L11/4016;;A47L11/4016;;A47L11/4041;;A47L11/4041;;A47L11/4058;;A47L11/4058;;A47L11/4061;;A47L11/4061;;A47L11/4083;;A47L11/4083;;A47L2201/04;;A47L2201/04;;A63D5/10;;A63D5/10,A47L11/03;;A47L11/10;;A47L11/40;;A63D5/10,118/681;;118/693;;118/694;;118/207;;118/260;;118/262;;118/268;;15/98;;15/103.5,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Dec. 2, 1960 [Sept. 5. 1959], No. 30399/59. Heading F2E. In a drum brake having leading and trailing shoes fulcrumed at one end on one or a pair of abutments and separated at their other ends by a floating expander, e.g. piston and cylinder, the assembly is resiliently urged in one direction and the movement is limited by a stop engaging the expander itself. In one embodiment, Fig. 1, the shoes 10, 11 fulcrumed at one end on a pair of abutments 13 adjusted by a wedge 14 having cam surfaces of unequal inclination to compensate for increased wear of the leading shoe 10. A cylinder 15 and piston 16 are arranged between the other ends of the shoes, the cylinder being guided in a slot in a back plate and having lugs 18, 19 engageable with a stop 17 secured to the back plate. A compression spring 21 urges the assembly in a direction to engage the lug 18 with the stop 17. In a modification, Fig. 2, the cylinder 21 is guided in slots 22 in a pair of plates 23, 24 in turn slidable in the back plate against the frictional resistance of spring washers 26. When this arrangement is used the wedge 14 is replaced by one having equally inclined surfaces, so that the assembly can take up different rest positions as the wear on the leading shoe becomes progressively greater than that on the trailing shoe. One of the washers 26 has an extension 31 to urge the cylinder resiliently towards one end of the slots 22. In a further modification (Fig. 5, not shown), in which the wedge also has equally inclined surfaces the cylinder has lugs and a spring similar to the lugs 18, 19 and spring 21 of the Fig. 1 form, but the stop 17 is replaced by a stop pin which is slidable relative to the back plate against frictional resistance, for the reason described above. Such a slidable stop pin 43 is shown in the embodiment of Fig 3, friction being applied by a spring-loaded washer 49. In this embodiment, however, the abutments 37, 38 are fixed and adjustment for wear is effected by a tappet 41 threaded in the piston 42 of floating cylinder 39. In this construction the pin 43 engages between the open end of the cylinder and a flange on the piston and is wedged towards the former by a spring 45. In a further modification (Fig. 4, not shown), the tappet is threaded in the cylinder instead of in the piston, the cylinder having a pair of lugs and a spring arranged as the lugs 18, 19 and spring 21 of the Fig. 1 embodiment, but engaging a pin similar to the pin 43 of the Fig. 3 embodiment.",GIRLING LTD,DAVIS JOHN WALTER,,https://lens.org/152-236-767-725-617,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,F16D65/546;;F16D51/18;;F16D65/22;;F16D2125/66,F16D51/18;;F16D65/14;;F16D65/22;;F16D65/54,F2E EBB           EBB;;F2E EBE           EBZ;;F2E EBJ           EBZ;;F2E EL            EL;;F2E ELAA          ELAA;;F2E E2M2B4C2A     EBB;;F2E E2M2E1        EBB;;F2E E2M2E3        EBB;;F2E E2M2E5B1      EBB;;F2E E2M2F4        EBB;;F2E E2M2K1        EBB,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   Methods of treating the surface of metals, such as aluminum, so that they can withstand the corrosive conditions in polymer electrolyte membrane, including those types known as proton exchange membrane, (PEM), fuel cells and similar electrochemical environments and still maintain a high level of electrical and thermal conductivity over extended periods of time, are disclosed. A conductive polymer outer layer used in combination with an intermediate layer between the conductive polymer and a core metal, that comprises a thin layer of silver, or other noble metal, at the interface between the conductive polymer and an underlying metal layer, are compatible with the requirements of PEM fuel cells. Such treated metals can be formed into bipolar plates or end plates after receiving the coatings, or the conductive polymer layer can be applied or shaped into specifically required forms, alternatively the core metal can be previously formed into the required physical form and then treated on its surfaces so as to realise the benefits of this invention.

   A process for solvent extraction of oils, in an extraction chamber, comprises the formation of a solvent mist with significant adiabatic cooling, whereby a pressure difference between the solvent inlet and outlet of the extraction chamber drives the solvent mist through the raw oil bearing. The solvent is fed to the extraction chamber at pressures exceeding atmospheric pressure, and the outlet of the extraction chamber is subject to a partial vacuum. An apparatus for solvent extraction comprises an extraction chamber for receiving oil bearing raw material therein, said extraction chamber comprising a solvent spray injection system connected via an inlet to a high pressure solvent feed circuit portion, said extraction chamber further connected via an outlet to a low pressure circuit portion connected to a gas recovery vacuum pump system.

Dec. 19, 1960 [Dec. 18, 1959], No. 43186/59. Heading F2E. In an automatically adjustable stop and retractor mechanism for a spot type disc brake, a rod 15, provided with limited axial movement against resilient resistance formed by spring 18, extends axially with a longitudinal bore 14 in an hydraulically applied piston 10 and frictional means 25 on the rod in slidable engagement with the bore. The frictional slidable engagement comprises a sleeve 21 axially slidable on the rod 15 and backed by a nut 23 adjustably screwed on the forward end of the rod and an internally coned split collar 25 in frictional engagement with the bore 14 and adapted to engage at its rear end with a fixed stop 26 on the rod, the rear end 24 of the sleeve 21 being formed with an annular rib engaging with the coned internal surface of the collar 25. When the brake is applied, the piston moves forwardly and the frictional grip between the collar 25 and the bore 14 causes the rod to move with the piston so that the spring washer 18 is elastically deformed, and on release of the piston the rod returns and retracts the piston. When wear of the friction pad has taken place and the forward movement of the piston in the application of the brake is greater than the permitted axial movement of the rod 15 against the resilient resistance by the spring washer 18, the piston will move forwardly relative to the rod to compensate for brake pad wear. The brake friction pad (not shown) is keyed to the piston by a head 12 on the forward end of a central boss 13 of the piston.",GIRLING LTD,DAVIS JOHN WALTER,,https://lens.org/014-014-604-035-606,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,F16D65/54,F16D65/54,F2E EEC           EEC;;F2E EL            EL;;F2E ELAA          ELAA;;F2E ELDS          ELDS;;F2E E104          ELAA;;F2E E104          ELDS;;F2E E114          ELDS,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In a spot-type disc brake, different members of cylinders are provided in the limbs of the caliper housing on opposite sides of the brake disc; the sums of the cross-sectional areas of the cylinders on the two sides of the disc being such that the efforts applied to opposite sides of the disc are substantially balanced. In the embodiment shown in Figs. 1 and 3, there are two angularly spaced cylinders 21 in one limb of the caliper housing 13 and a single cylinder 18 of larger diameter in the other limb; the area of the single cylinder being equal to the sum of the areas of the other two. The above arrangement provides that the radial dimension of the central part of the caliper limb housing the larger number of cylinders may be substantially less than the corresponding dimension of the other limb and, conversely, the circumferential length of the central part of the caliper limb housing the smaller number of cylinders can be less than the corresponding dimension of the limb housing the larger number of cylinders (as may be seen in Fig. 3).

   A tower for cooling a liquid includes an impermeable outer wall, and a flexible but non-stretchable, porous, air-permeable inner wall spaced inwardly from the outer wall to define a chamber between the two walls. The air-permeable inner wall has a multiplicity of pores through which air can pass in order to remove deposits from the internal face of the inner wall. A delivery means is provided for injecting air into the chamber between the two walls, and further delivery means injects air into the internal volume within the inner wall, this being the cooling air. A further means sprays the liquid into the internal volume surrounded by the inner wall. To provide pressurized air to the annular chamber, openings are provided in the outer wall, and a plenum external to the outer wall communicates with the openings, so that by continuously injecting air into the plenum, it will automatically and continuously pass to the annular chamber, and thence through the pores of the inner wall, in order to clean the inner wall of deposits.

Anti-jack-knifing arrangements. DUNLOP HOLDINGS Ltd. 24 Oct., 1968 [31 Oct., 1967], No. 49341/67. Heading B7T. [Also in Division F2] An anti-jack-knifing system for an articulated vehicle comprises a device operable to restrict freedom of pivoting of a tractor portion relative to a trailer portion, and a skid-sensing means responsive to a change in the rate of rotation of an associated wheel of the vehicle and arranged to actuate the device, the device being operable only when actuated by the skid-sensing means. In Fig. 1, a pneumatically-operated brake 4 is arranged coaxially with a king-pin 3 which links tractor portion 1 and a trailer portion 2. A skid-sensing means 5, arranged between the king-pin brake 4 and a reservoir 6 of air pressurized by an engine-driven compressor, is coupled to the propeller shaft of the tractor portion. A second skid-sensing means 7, arranged between the king-pin brake and a reservoir 8 of pressurized air, is coupled to the back wheels of the trailer. When an incipient skid develops at either the rear wheels of the trailer or the rear wheels of the tractor, the appropriate skid-sensing means operates to connect the king-pin brake to an air reservoir, causing actuation of the king-pin brake. In Fig. 2 (not shown) a sleeve having a helicalslotted connection with a shaft (driven from a wheel or the vehicle propeller shaft), is forced to move axially along the shaft by inertia mechanism, including a flywheel, when the shaft is decelerated. The end of the sleeve, on such movement, operates an air valve to supply the king-pin brake.

Oct. 5, 1960 [Sept. 5, 1959], No. 30397/59. Headings F2E and F2Q. A disc brake of the caliper type comprises mechanical actuating mechanism which causes friction pads 16 and 19 to be applied to a disc 10 with an increasing mechanical advantage as the resistance to movement of the pads increases. A spindle 23, rotatable by brake applying means, has, screw threaded on an integral spigot 24, a block 27 which advances when the spindle 23 is rotated, to force, by means of balls 35, a second block 31 to apply a pad 19 to grip the disc 10 against a fixed pad 19. A pawl 34 prevents rotation of block 31 and block 27 during this motion, but as the pressure of the pads increases, the block 27 rotates with the spigot 24, causing the balls 35 to ride up tapering recesses 36 in block 27 to increase the mechanical advantage. On release of the brake, the block 27 rotates with the spindle 23 due to one or more pawls 29 on a sleeve 26 of the spindle engaging in teeth in block 27. When the balls have returned to their normal positions both blocks rotate together. This provides automatic wear adjustment. The blocks are urged towards each other by springs 37.",GIRLING LTD,DAVIS JOHN WALTER,,https://lens.org/198-858-841-353-002,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,F16D65/567;;F16D2125/36,F16D65/14;;F16D65/56,F2E EEB           EEB;;F2E EL            EL;;F2E ELDA          ELDA;;F2E E104          ELDA;;F2E E114          ELDA;;F2E E2N1A4A1      EEB;;F2E E2N1C1        EEB;;F2E E2N1D10       EEB;;F2E E2N1D15       EEB;;F2E E2N1D8B       EEB;;F2E E2N1D9        EEB;;F2E E2N1E4        EEB;;F2E E2N1K1        EEB;;F2E E3K           EP/E3K,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The profile shows individual layer and sub-surface anomaly depth and thickness. Radar signals are transmitted into the structure using a surface-coupled transmitter antenna and reflected waves are received by an array of surface-coupled receiver antennas located at different known spacings from the transmitter antenna. The different signal travel times are measured. An accurate measure (.+-.5%) of signal velocity through each pavement layer can be calculated using the surface-coupled assembly spacing and travel time information. With the velocity accurately known at each sounding point, using conventional calculations one can determine interface depth and layer thickness, to an accuracy in the order of .+-.5%. In a preferred embodiment, an air-launched ""horn"" antenna assembly is used in conjunction with the surface-coupled antenna assembly. The horn antenna assembly gives good resolution for layer thicknesses of about 50-100 mm; the surface-coupled antenna assembly gives good resolution for layer thicknesses greater than about 100-150 mm, and gives greater penetration depth.

A tunable stub (69) is employed to reflect a selected amount of transmitted energy (67) to the local oscillator (LO) of the receiver for mixing with the incoming received signal. The coupler can be constructed from any known type RF transmission line suitable for passing or coupling signals of radar frequencies. A significant amount of the transmitter power is absorbed in a power absorbing RF load allowing only a small amount to be transmitted from the antenna (65) and a still smaller amount (67) fed back as LO to the receiver (64).

Dec. 23, 1958 [Jan. 3, 1958; March 31, 1958], Nos. 306/58 and 10820/58. Class 40(7). [Also in Group VIII] A radome having skin and core layers is provided with heating passages in the core layer arranged so that the heating fluid circulating in the passages is in close proximity to the outer skin layer over a large part of its area. To do this the areas where the core and outer skin are in contact are reduced to relatively small size and may be little more than lines. This reduces the strength of the resulting radome considerably, particularly where the core material is not readily bondable . to the material of the outer skin. To overcome this difficulty according to the present invention an intermediate layer is provided of material which can easily be bonded to the skin and this layer is secured to the skin over a comparatively small area and to the core over a comparatively large area to effectively hold skin and core together. In practice the core layer may be composed of expanded nitrile rubber and it may be cut or moulded to the required shape or foamed in place. The skin layer is preferably a glass fibre reinforcement, in which case the intermediate layer may be Of knitted or woven glass cloth. Suitable adhesives for the intermediate layer are those of epoxy or phenolic type, a glycol-maleic anhydride polyester laminating resin could also be used. The heating channels are conveniently triangular in cross section with their maximum width adjacent the outer wall. It is usual to provide an inner wall skin layer and the apices of the triangular heating channels may reach through the core to the inner skin or they may only reach to an intermediate level in the core. Fig. 3 shows a section through a radome wall in which the triangular heating channels 4 reach right through to the inner skin 2 and divide up the expanded core layer 3 into separate triangular sections. The outer skin 1 is in close proximity to the heating channels over a large part of its area. It has the intermediate layer 5 attached to it along the lines between the heating channel edges. The necessary strength of adhesion between the intermediate layer and the core is achieved by attaching them together over the centre channelled face of the core. Fig. 3 also shows the optional use of reinforcing strips 6 of approximate U-section bonded to the outer skin and to the intermediate layer adjacent the outer skin. Fig. 4 shows another embodiment in which the core 3 is made up of a number of separate trapezium cross-sectioned units. Each unit is wrapped in a separate intermediate layer portion 5 which overlaps as shown against the inner skin and is attached to both inner and outer skins where it is in contact with them. The heating channels 4 are triangular in section as before.",MARSTON EXCELSIOR LTD,DAVIS JOHN HOWARD,,https://lens.org/089-925-223-967-803,Granted Patent,no,0,3,1,1,0,B64D15/04,B64D15/04,B5S S17Y;;B5S S171;;B5S S192;;B5S S214;;B5S S221;;B5S S228;;B5S S228;;B5S S239;;B5S S239;;B5S S242;;B5S S242;;B5S S249;;B5S S249;;B5S S25X;;B5S S25X;;B5S S25Y;;B5S S25Y;;B5S S250;;B5S S250;;B5S S252;;B5S S252;;B5S S253;;B5S S253;;B5S S29X;;B5S S29X;;B5S S290;;B5S S290;;B5S S295;;B5S S295;;B5S S30X;;B5S S30X;;B5S S300;;B5S S300;;B5S S301;;B5S S301;;B5S S308;;B5S S308;;B5S S32Y;;B5S S32Y;;B5S S326;;B5S S326;;B5S S33Y;;B5S S33Y;;B5S S334;;B5S S334;;B5S S55Y;;B5S S55Y;;B5S S567;;B5S S567;;B5S S57X;;B5S S57X;;B5S S574;;B5S S574;;B5S S578;;B5S S578;;B5S S58X;;B5S S58X;;B5S S583;;B5S S583;;B5S S584;;B5S S584;;B5S S592;;B5S S592;;B5S S598;;B5S S598;;B5S S601;;B5S S601;;B5S S604;;B5S S604;;B5S S609;;B5S S609;;B5S S61Y;;B5S S61Y;;B5S S614;;B5S S614;;B5S S635;;B5S S635;;B5S S66Y;;B5S S66Y;;B5S S662;;B5S S662;;B5S S669;;B5S S669;;B5S S701;;B5S S701;;B5S S702;;B5S S702;;B5S S704;;B5S S704;;B5S S706,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Ltd. 7 July, 1966 [15 July, 1965], No. 29998/65. Heading F2F. In a compressed-air or vacuum brake system for the tractor portion of a tractor/trailer vehicle, each of the rear wheel brake cylinders 9, 10 is provided with two chambers 14, 15, the former being connected with the driver's valve 6, which is supplied by a reservoir 5, and the latter being connected via an anti-skid valve unit 20 to either atmosphere or an anti-skid reservoir 18 which is isolated from the reservoir 5 by a check valve 4, the arrangement operating such that when a skid is imminent the valve unit 20 operates to cut off the connection of chambers 15 to atmosphere and to connect them instead to the reservoir 18 whereby the brake is released, pressure build-up in the chambers 14 during operation of the valve unit 20 being prevented by balanced exhaust valves 56. The embodiments described are compressed-air systems. In the embodiment of Fig. 1, the valve unit 20 also controls the supply of compressed-air to the chambers 14, cutting off the supply when a skid is imminent. When a skid-correcting pressure is supplied by the valve unit 20 to the chambers 15, the resultant pressure rise in chambers 14 overcomes the combined effect of the pressure in the lines 60, which are now isolated by the valve unit 20, and springs 59, so that pistons 57 are moved to open exhaust valves 61 which relieve the pressure. The valves 56 also act as quick-release valves during release of the brakes, A ball-valve 64 in each piston 57 prevents release of pressure from the chambers 14 except by way of the exhaust valves 61, but allows flow of air into the chambers 14. Instead of or in addition to the isolating effect of the valve unit 20 on the air supplied to chambers 14, a sensitivity control valve 70, Fig. 4, may be incorporated in the system, its inlet 74 being connected with the driver's valve 6 while its outlet 73 is connected either directly or via the valve unit 20 to the chambers 14. The valve 70 is responsive to a control pressure at 80 which is conveniently obtained from that used to control the position of the spool 23 of the valve unit 20 where, as shown in Fig. 1, valve unit 20 is a two-stage valve having a primary valve 21 which is operated mechanically by the control-rod 22 of an inertia unit (not shown), driven by the vehicle transmission and which determines the control pressure. The control pressure passes via a check valve 78 of the valve 70 to a chamber 77 where it controls the position of a spring-loaded restrictor member 75 so as to determine the throttling effect of a waisted central portion 85 of the restrictor member on the air passing between inlet 74 and outlet 73, whereby should the driver maintain a heavy pressure on the brake pedal, pressure in chambers 14 and 15 is not allowed to build up too quickly and so reduce the differential between the pressures in chambers 14 and 15 during a sustained skid correction. When valve 70 is used, the valve unit 20 may be simplified by omitting its function of isolating the air supplied to chambers 14 (Fig. 5, not shown). Alternative means for ensuring that pressure in reservoir 18 is always higher than the pressure supplied to chambers 14 comprises the provision of a pressure-balancing valve (170, Figs. 11, 12, not shown) between the driver's valve 6 and the valve unit 20 of the Fig. 1 embodiment which limits the pressure supplied to chambers 14 to a value below the pressure in reservoir 18. In another embodiment (Fig. 6, not shown) a sensitivity valve (101) similar to the valve 70 is used in conjunction with a single-stage anti-skid valve unit 100, Fig. 7, which comprises coaxial plungers 105, 109, slidable in a sleeve 107 and urged away from one another and from an adjustable top cap 108 by springs 110, 111. When plunger 22 of the anti-skid device moves upwards, an exhaust valve 117, 118 is first closed and an inlet valve 120, 121 then opens to perform the change-over of chambers 15 from atmospheric pressure to that supplied by the reservoir 18. The positions of the valve seats 118, 120 are simultaneously adjusted by adjustment of the cap 108, which includes an exhaust flap 115, movement of the cap in turn causing the sleeve 107 to be adjusted. Alternatively, individual adjustment of both inlet and exhaust valves may be provided (Figs. 8, 9, not shown). Exhausting of the chambers 15 may be accelerated by the provision of a quickrelease valve (160, Fig. 10, not shown). Where the pressure-limiting valve (170, Figs. 11, 12, not shown) referred to above is used in conjunction with a two-stage valve unit 20, a pressure-reducing valve 190, Fig. 13, may also be included between the reservoir 18 and the primary valve of the valve unit 20 to control the pressure in the chambers 15 in accordance with the pressure of air being supplied to the chambers 14. The valve 190 comprises a diaphragm 196 between two bore portions of different diameter respectively associated with inlet 191 from the reservoir 18 and a connection 191 to the line between valve unit 20 and one of the chambers 14, whereby a valve member 199 attached to the diaphragm moves to engage a valve seat 200 when the pressure at outlet 198 to the primary valve of the valve unit 20 rises to a predetermined value with respect to that being supplied to the chambers 14. The valve 190 includes a check valve 204, 205 to allow release of pressure from the primary valve of the valve unit 20 when air is released from the line feeding the chambers 14, i.e. when the brakes are released.

Granular polycrystalline silicon is then fed onto the exposed unmelted chunk polycrystalline silicon to complete the charge of silicon in the crucible. The granular polycrystalline silicon is intermittently delivered using a plurality of alternating on-periods and off-periods. During each on-period, granular polycrystalline silicon is flowed through a feed device that directs the granular polycrystalline silicon onto the unmelted chunk polycrystalline silicon. During each off-period, the flow of the granular polycrystalline silicon is interrupted. The loaded chunk polycrystalline silicon and the fed granular polycrystalline silicon are melted to form the silicon melt.

A problem with this approach is that when elastomers are blended with thermoplastic polymers such as styrene/ acrylonitrile copolymers the flexural strength of the material is considerably reduced. The invention provides a thermoplastic moulding material comprising styrene/acrylonitrile copolymer, an elastomeric material having an elongation at break greater than the styrene/acrylonitrile copolymer, a polyimide pre- polymer and a reinforcing filler. The polyimide prepolymer is an addition polyimide prepared from a polyamine and a bis-imide of an unsaturated carboxylic acid. The reinforcing filler is glass fibre or mica, although other fillers may be included along with these. The elastomeric material may be a sulphur vulcanizable rubber or a thermoplastic rubber. if vulcanizable, the rubber is preferably used uncured.

July 22, 1960 [July 23, 1959], No. 25262/59. Heading F2E. In a friction brake the retraction of a friction member from a co-operating surface in the off position of the brake is effected by the engagement of a retraction device at all times with a part of a resilient member which engages with the material of the friction member. In the disc brake illustrated, in Fig. 3, each friction pad 17 is engaged at its periphery by a resilient finger 26 of a resilient steel spring strip 23, the finger 26 urging it away from the disc surface, the movement of the finger being limited to the amount permitted by slot 27 in a web 25 of a plate bolted to the calliper housing; the clearance being only sufficient to provide a predetermined clearance between the pad and the disc. When the pad wears and its movement towards the disc becomes greater than that permitted to the finger by the slot 27, the pointed end of the finger ploughs a groove in the friction material during the excess part of the pad movement so that it takes up a fresh position in the pad displaced from the previous position by an amount equal to the pad wear. On release of the brake the finger again retracts the pad through the distance permitted by slot 27 so that a substantially constant clearance between the pad and the disc is maintained through the life of the pad. A second finger 28 may be provided on the inner side of the pad to ensure even engagement thereof. Instead of engaging beneath the surface of the friction material, the end of the finger 36 may be made flat (Fig. 7), to bear against the surface of the pads instead of ploughing grooves therein.

   An optical sensor includes dual fields of view including a panoramic field of view spanning 360 in azimuth angle in a direction perpendicular to an axis of the sensor, and a limb-looking field of view non-perpendicular to the axis for viewing the limb of the earth. Both fields of view are imaged onto annular regions of one of more focal plane arrays comprising pixels arranged in a rectangular array of rows and columns. The sensor is used in a method for capturing rate and direction of rotation of a satellite about its axes and for detecting orientation of the satellite about two of its axes. Rate and direction are determined by finding the center of the earth relative to axes of the focal plane array based on the image of the earth limb from the panoramic field of view, and comparing the earth center location at a series of sequential times. The rate and position information are used for stabilizing an initially tumbling satellite after tip-off. Once the satellite is stabilized, its orientation is detected by finding the earth center location on the focal plane array based on the earth limb image from the limb-looking optics of the sensor. In one embodiment of the invention, both fields of view are imaged onto concentric inner and outer ring-shaped regions of the same focal plane array.

These cables pass over sheaves 21, 24 and support a vertically movable structure 25 'of substantially the same length and width as the tank. The structure comprises a vertical wall 25, and a floor 26 of plates provided with openings through which pass the columns 7, 8, 9 and, cross-bars 27. Roller frames 28. Fig. 11, mounted on the floor carry rollers 29 which run on three surfaces of the columns 7, 8, 9. Fixed and spaced rail sections 32, Fig. 7, are supported by the beam 6 and are joined at the ends by semi-circular pieces 34. Bradkets 35 on the bottom of the structure 25 carry rail sections 36 which bridge the gaps between the sections 32 when the structure is lowered. The work carriers 37 are engaged by pushers 41 which are pivotally mounted on rods 33 carried by the structure 25 and reciprocated by the piston rod 47 of a cylinder 42. The pushers straddle the bars and the bottom of the slot in each of them is sloped downwards at 40<SP>1</SP>, Fig. 13. When the bar moves in one direction, the unsloped portion of each pusher bears against the bottom of the bar which acts as a stop, but when movement occurs in the 'other direction, the slope 40<SP>1</SP> permits the pusher to swing upwards and over a carrier when it meets it. The end of the piston rod 47 is connected by a swivel 48 to an arm 46 fast on a vertical shaft 43 which is concentric with one end piece 34. Arms 50, 51 on the shaft carry brackets 52 55 which are connected by links 53, 56 to the pusher bars 38. At the other end of the apparatus a similar arrangement of shaft 43, arms 50, 51 and links 53, 56 is provided, but the cylinder 42 and link 46 are dispensed with. Limit switches 60, 61 Fig. 6, at opposite sides of the crosshead 17 are engaged by it for timed control of the cylinders 15, 42 in proper sequence. Limit switches 62, 63 engaged by the arms 50, 51 at the ends of their movements are provided for the same purpose.",UDYLITE CORP,DAVIS JOHN VIRDEN,,https://lens.org/175-603-117-597-605,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B65G49/049,B65G49/04,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

DUNLOP CO. Ltd. 11 Aug., 1966 [24 Aug., 1965], No. 36195/65. Heading F2F. A rotary-inertia skid-sensing device for an anti-skid braking system comprises a driving shaft 8 which drives a flywheel 18 through a torque-sensitive coupling consisting of a helical spring 42 arranged within a sleeve 24 secured to the flywheel and extending into a sleeve 21 rotatable independently of both the flywheel and the shaft, the sleeve 21 being coupled to the shaft 8 by a transverse pin 37 passing through openings 38 in a hollow end portion of the shaft which are larger than the diameter of the pin, and the lower end of the sleeve 21 having cam faces 34 engaged with cam faces 33 of an actuating member in the form of a coaxial sleeve 28 which is slidable on splines of the hollow end portion of the shaft 8 so as to rotate with the shaft. A helical tension spring 36 is connected between the second sleeve 28 and the pin 37 such as to act as a torsion spring as well as urging the two sleeves together so that, when the flywheel overruns the shaft as a result of rapid deceleration, relative rotation of the two sleeves is resisted both by the friction between the cam forces 33, 34 caused by the tension in spring 36 and by the torsional force exerted by spring 36. When both these are overcome, the resulting camming action between the faces 33, 34 causes axial movement of the second sleeve 28 which causes it to engage the button 43 of a micro-switch controlling a valve in the fluid circuit of the brakes, or alternatively actuate the valve direct, so as to reduce braking of the associated vehicle wheels. The torsional force exerted by the spring 36 is variable by providing the sleeve 28 with a rotatable end cap 35 to which the adjacent end of the spring is secured, the cap being provided with a flange 44 having a pair of ears 45, 46 which can be bent to engage a series of notches in the sleeve to lock the cap in its adjusted position. The shaft 8 is driven by a gear-wheel 9 engageable with a gear-wheel of the vehicle transmission, the gear-wheel 9 being connected with the shaft 8 so as to provide a predetermined amount of backlash, either by the peg 12 shown which engages a slot in the gear-wheel or by any of the other arrangements described in Specification 1,156,014 which is referred to.",DUNLOP CO LTD,DAVIS JOHN WALTER,,https://lens.org/051-058-948-405-910,Granted Patent,no,0,3,8,10,0,B60T8/74;;B60T8/74,B60T8/74,F2F FDA           FDAZ;;F2F F701          FDAZ;;F2F F702          FDAZ,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

June 8, 1962 [June 27, 1961], No. 23137/61. Heading F2E. A disc brake comprises a rotatable disc 10, a friction element 27, a deformable element 32 to maintain the element parallel to the braking surface of the disc and a brake-applying member 11, 12 independent of the deformable element for forcing the element into frictional contact with the disc and for taking the torque when the brake is applied. As shown, friction elements 27 are secured to blocks 26 loosely mounted in apertures 24 in the pressure plates 11, 12 which are pivoted at 13 on the fixed support 14. Bolts 30 are threaded into the blocks 26 and are gripped by hooks 33 at the end of the deformable metal beams 32. Operation of the brake is effected by a lever 20 pivoted at 21 on the plate 12. A tie-rod 15 connects the plate 11 to a lever 20 by means of a trunnion block 18 and a nut 19 which may be rotated automatically as wear takes place. If the friction pads 28 which are bonded to metal backing plates 29 are not in full contact on initial application of the brake, the backing plates 29 rock on the convex surface of the plates 11, 12 to accommodate themselves to the disc. The shank of the bolt 30 moves along the hook 33 which grips the shank when the brake is released to retain it in the aligned position. As wear takes place the beams 32 will take on a permanent set but will still retain the bolt 30 in the aligned position and will have enough resilience to withdraw the pads after each brake application.",DUNLOP RUBBER CO,DAVIS JOHN WALTER,,https://lens.org/076-766-922-004-283,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,2,0,F16D55/2245,F16D55/224,F2E EEL           EEL;;F2E EHB           EHB/;;F2E EL            EL;;F2E EL            E2K;;F2E ELDA          ELDA;;F2E E1A1A2        -;;F2E E1A1B         -;;F2E E1A1C         -;;F2E E104          ELDA;;F2E E114          ELDA;;F2E E2N1A1        -;;F2E E2N1A4A2      -;;F2E E2N1A5        -;;F2E E2N1C2A       -;;F2E E2N1C3        -;;F2E E2N1D12       -;;F2E E2N1D13       -;;F2E E2N1D16       -;;F2E E2N1D2D       -;;F2E E2N1D3A       -;;F2E E2N1E5        -;;F2E E2N1K1        -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In the process, the crucible is loaded with chunk polysilicon to form a charge having a bowl-like shape, wherein initially the load generally slopes radially upwardly and outwardly from the centerline toward the sidewall formation to an apex and then slopes generally downwardly and outwardly from the apex to the sidewall formation. The bowl-shaped chunk polysilicon charge is heated to form a partially melted charge, and granular polysilicon is fed onto the partially melted charge to form a mixed charge of chunk and granular polysilicon. As the mixed charge is further heated to form a silicon melt, the unmelted chunk polysilicon present above the melt surface acts to deflect any molten silicon that may be splattered as granular polysilicon rapidly melts and hydrogen is released.",MEMC ELECTRONIC MATERIALS,HOLDER JOHN DAVIS,SUNEDISON SEMICONDUCTOR PTE.

Ltd. 18 Aug., 1965 [26 Aug., 1964], No. 34859/64. Headings F2E and F2F. An anti-skid fluid pressure control device for a brake in which a friction member is movable circumferentially to a limited extent under the drag force, particularly a spot-type disc brake having its caliper 3 arranged for limited rotation about the axis of the disc 1, as by rotatably mounting it on a support 2, comprises a valve for reducing the pressure in cylinders 6 of the caliper, and which is normally maintained open by an arrangement of springs one of which opposes movement of the caliper under the drag force, the valve being arranged to be moved bodily by the drag force as brake pressure is increased and being subsequently prevented from returning by means responsive to supply pressure, whereupon reverse rotation of the caliper under incipient skid conditions causes the valve to close and pressure to be reduced in cylinders 6 either, as shown, by an expansion chamber 14 or by a relief valve. The fluid may be either hydraulic, supplied by a master cylinder or compressed air. In either case the valve consists of a body 9 which is slidable in a bracket 11 of the support 2, and a valve element 15 which is fluted to allow fluid flow past it along a bore 18 in which it slides, the head 16 of the valve element 15 normally being held clear of a seat, opening to a supply chamber 12, by a plunger 22 slidable in a bore 23 in the body and engaged at its remote end with the caliper, via a contact plate 26. A spring 29 urges the body 9 towards the caliper so that a stop 28 normally engages the head 16, and a spring 25 maintains the caliper normally in a position wherein stop pins 4 of the support 2 engage one end of slots 5 in the caliper. When pressure fluid is supplied to the chamber 12 it is also supplied to a locking or restraining device which as shown comprises a chamber 31 containing a friction pad 30 which is pressed by the fluid against the body to resist sliding movement. The friction produced by the pad 30 is overcome in normal braking by the drag force acting on the caliper 3 so that the valve is moved bodily by the plunger 22 acting via the element 15 and stop 28, compressing spring 25 in proportion to the drag force. Under incipient skid conditions, however, the caliper 3 reverses its movement while pad 30 holds the body 9 in its new position. The plunger 22 therefore retracts relative to the body 9, allowing a spring 17 to close the valve and, upon further retraction of plunger 22 in chamber 27, increasing the volume of the closed-off portion of the system to reduce pressure in the cylinders 6. In a modification (Fig. 2, not shown) the chamber 31 and pad 30 are replaced by a one-way valve 43 feeding fluid from a reservoir to a chamber 41 provided at the right-hand end of the body 9, and by a by-pass valve 46 for the valve 43 which is controlled by brake pressure.",DUNLOP CO LTD,DAVIS JOHN WALTER,,https://lens.org/115-322-180-309-47X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,4,0,B60T8/52;;B60T8/52,B60T8/52,F2E EEC           ED06;;F2E EEC           EEC;;F2E E2N1A1        -;;F2E E2N1A4A2      -;;F2E E2N1A5        -;;F2E E2N1C2B       -;;F2E E2N1C3        -;;F2E E2N1D6C2      -;;F2F FC            FC611/681;;F2F FDB           FDB73X;;F2F F1A1B2D       -;;F2F F1BX          -;;F2F F1B9X         -;;F2F F200          F3(C;;F2F F228          -;;F2F F232          -;;F2F F234          F3(C;;F2F F244          F3(C;;F2F F248          F3(C;;F2F F262          F3(C;;F2F F270          F3(C;;F2F F336          F3(C;;F2F F354          F3(C;;F2F F611          FC611/681;;F2F F681          FC611/681;;F2F F73X          FDB73X,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

AMERICAN OPTICAL CO. May 28, 1954, No. 15908/54. Class 97 (1). A projection system comprises a plane mirror and a concave mirror facing one another, each mirror having a central aperture whereby light from the object passing through the aperture in one mirror is reflected by the second mirror back to the first mirror which in turn reflects the light through the aperture in the second mirror to form an image, an opaque baffle being located between the mirrors to intercept the major portion of the light passing directly through the two apertures. As shown, light from an object 1 such as a cathode-ray tube, passes through a central aperture 8 in a plane mirror 4 to reach a concave spherical mirror 3 from which it is reflected to the mirror 4 and thence directed through the central aperture 6 of the mirror 3 to form an image on a screen 7. A Schmidt plate 10 is provided in the aperture 6 to correct spherical aberration and an opaque baffle 9 prevents direct light from the object 1 reaching the screen 7. If desired, the baffle 9 may be dimensioned so as to allow some direct light to reach the screen to produce even illumination. A further diaphragm 12 may be provided. In a modification, the mirror 3 is replaced by a rear-surface reflecting lensmirror, correction being effected by lenses placed adjacent the mirror 3 between it and the screen 7.

The system produces voltage level inputs directed to the distance and approach rate to an object, vehicle speed and driving monitor inputs, such as steering angles, turning rates, braking, and acceleration/deacceleration. These voltages are properly weighted as to their importance. These weighted instantaneous input voltages are summed. The summed voltage is then compared with a predetermined voltage level dividing safe and danger zones. If the summed level falls within the safe zone, the radar system produces no output signals. If the summed voltage level falls within the danger zone, the radar system produces audio warning signals and if impact with an object is eminent vehicle braking signals are then produced. The invention further includes an air bag deployment feature. A vehicle air bag is deployed when the vehicle speed exceeds a pre-determined value and the distance to impact is within a predetermined distance. The air bag deployment and audio and braking functions are independent.","DAVIS, JOHN W.","DAVIS, JOHN W.",,https://lens.org/183-665-410-041-140,Search Report,yes,4,0,7,7,0,G01S13/58;;G01S13/931;;G01S2013/9325;;G01S2013/9322;;G01S2013/93185;;G01S2013/93271;;G01S2013/932;;G08G1/16;;G01S13/931;;G01S13/58;;G01S2013/9325;;G01S2013/932;;G01S2013/9322;;G01S2013/93185;;G01S2013/93271,G01S13/931;;B60R21/00;;B60R21/16;;B60W30/00;;G01S13/58,,1,1,065-707-773-022-437,10.1109/t-vt.1982.23918,"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY, vol.

GIRLING Ltd. July 22, 1960 [July 23, 1959], No. 25260/59. Heading F2F. [Also in Division F1] A booster-assisted hydraulic operating system, such as a braking system, comprises a manuallyoperated member 34 which actuates a piston 23 or the like for displacing fluid from a master cylinder 10 and, at the same time, actuates a valve or valves 47, 48 controlling the energization of a booster 16, 17 actuating another means 18 other than the piston 23 for increasing the displacement of fluid from the master cylinder when the booster is energized. The means 18 may be a hollow piston-rod which is secured to a piston 17 in the cylinder 16 of the booster, the cylinder being connected by a passage 38 to a valve chamber 22 which, at one end, has a valve 48 co-operating with a recess 44 joined by a passage 43 to a source of vacuum and connected by a passage 51 to a cylinder 52, the vacuum causing the rod 54 of a piston 53 in the cylinder to engage a groove 55 in a sleeve 37 so that the sleeve moves with the booster piston 17. The opposite end of the valve chamber has a valve 47 which co-operates with a recess 41 connected by a passage 39 to atmosphere. The valves 47, 48 are carried by a reduced part of a rod which is formed with the piston 23 and connected to the operating member 34. In the inoperative position, the valve 48 is closed and valve 47 is open to connect the booster cylinder to the atmosphere. Movement of the rod 34 causes the piston 23 to displace fluid from the master cylinder 10 through a port 14 leading to the brake cylinder and reverses the valves 47, 48 so that the vacuum is connected to the cylinder 16 and the piston 17 moves the hollow rod 18 to displace additional fluid from the cylinder 10. The initial movement of the piston also actuates a valve 27 to close a passage 12 leading from a reservoir 11 providing liquid to make-up for losses caused by leakage. In the event of failure of the source of vacuum, the piston-rod 54 is disengaged from the groove 55 to permit actuation of the piston 23 on its own. In other embodiments, the manually-operated and booster-operated pistons are separate and parallel, or the booster may move the master cylinder in the opposite direction to the manually-operated piston.",GIRLING LTD,DAVIS JOHN WALTER,,https://lens.org/038-960-217-942-726,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B60T13/244,B60T13/24,F2F FFD           FFD825;;F2F F825          FFD825,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Jan. 25, 1963 [Feb. 2, 1962], No. 4212/62. Heading F2E. A disc brake comprises a retractor member 48 having a pivotal connection with a non- rotatable part of the brake and a frictional clamp operable on the retractor member 48 and permitting pivotal movement thereof only on application of a force thereto greater than that exerted by the clamp. A resilient means 54 is connected between the retractor member 48 and a pressure member 28 associated with a friction element 19 of the brake to retract the friction element 19 a predetermined distance upon release of the brake. In the construction shown the pressure member 28 and the retractor member 48 are pivoted about a common pin. The normal brake movement is allowed by a peg 53 of the pressure member 28 moving in an elongated aperture 52 of the retractor member 48, the latter being pivoted on greater brake movement due to friction pad wear. The friction clamp assembly (Fig. 1, not shown) includes a pair of friction discs one on each side of the retractor member, a pair of clamping washers positioned about the friction discs and a securing nut and bolt, the bolt providing the abovementioned common pin. The friction discs are of smaller diameter than the washers and are sealed about their outer peripheries by rings of rubber or like resilient material. The brake is applied by a piston and cylinder arrangement 33, 34 through a connecting rod 32, the pressure member 28 being provided with a step 35 for co-operating with a pin 36 of the brake housing when the friction linings 23 are fully worn.

A restrictor member 25, movable by a diaphragm actuator 41 when supplied with air under pressure via inlet 13 and non-return valve 47 from a valve 9 when a plunger 10 therein is actuated by an inertia type skid sensor (not shown), provides a variable restriction to the flow of air through passage 22 for operating the brakes. The restrictor has a head 27 for engagement with a valve seat 28 and is provided with a recess 29 which permits only a restricted flow from inlet 24 to outlet 23 when head 27 is seated. The non-return valve 47 has a bleed orifice 50 to permit an exhaust flow of air from chamber 42 at a predetermined rate following each anti-skid operation. Anti-skid operation (Fig. 1).-When a skid is sensed plunger 10 of valve 9 is moved and causes air pressure from a reservoir 8 to be admitted to a chamber 3. Simultaneously air pressure is applied via line 13 to chamber 42 of actuator 41, thereby the restrictor member is moved to restrict flow to chamber 2. When the skid tendency is overcome plunger 10 is released and chamber 3 is connected to exhaust. The rise in pressure in chamber 2 is delayed by the restrictor to ensure that the rise does not occur in a period when anti-skid control valve 9 is operating cyclically to apply and release the brakes. Alternatively, the restrictor valve actuator may include a piston (Fig. 3, not shown) instead of a diaphragm, and a needle valve may be provided by means of which a restricted exhaust flow from the actuator is adjustable, to adjust the period of time in which the restrictor offers the greatest restriction.

    An optical sensor includes dual fields of view including a panoramic field of view spanning 360 in azimuth angle in a direction perpendicular to an axis of the sensor, and a limb-looking field of view non-perpendicular to the axis for viewing the limb of the earth. Both fields of view are imaged onto annular regions of one of more focal plane arrays comprising pixels arranged in a rectangular array of rows and columns. The sensor is used in a method for capturing rate and direction of rotation of a satellite about its axes and for detecting orientation of the satellite about two of its axes. Rate and direction are determined by finding the center of the earth relative to axes of the focal plane array based on the image of the earth limb from the panoramic field of view, and comparing the earth center location at a series of sequential times. The rate and position information are used for stabilizing an initially tumbling satellite after tip-off. Once the satellite is stabilized, its orientation is detected by finding the earth center location on the focal plane array based on the earth limb image from the limb-looking optics of the sensor. In one embodiment of the invention, both fields of view are imaged onto concentric inner and outer ring-shaped regions of the same focal plane array.

The system produces voltage level inputs directed to the distance and approach rate to an object, vehicle speed and driving monitor inputs, such as steering angles, turning rates, braking, and acceleration/deacceleration. These voltages are properly weighted as to their importance. These weighted instantaneous input voltages are summed. The summed voltage is then compared with a predetermined voltage level dividing safe and danger zones. If the summed level falls within the safe zone, the radar system produces no output signals. If the summed voltage level falls within the danger zone, the radar system produces audio warning signals and if impact with an object is eminent vehicle braking signals are then produced.

Aug. 23, 1962 [Sept. 2, 1961], No. 31621/61. Heading F2E. A disc brake comprises a non-rotatable brake housing 10 having an abutment face 29 to resist circumferential movement of a friction element 19 in the plane of a rotatable disc 11 and means 22 for forcing the element into frictional engagement with the disc. The friction element, Fig. 4 (not shown), has a shape which is produced when one radial end of a segment is cut off and positioned so that the erst-while radial edges abut. As shown, the pads 19 are forced against the disc by pressure members 14, 15, which are pivoted at 16 to the housing 10 and extend at a slight angle to each other. Convex protrusions 17 on the members 14, 15 bear on the backing plate 18. The pressure members are actuated by a pistoncylinder mechanism 22, a pivoted lever 21 and a tie-rod 20 having an automatic adjuster 26. A pair of springy but deformable fingers 34, the ends of which are engaged in holes 35 in the members 14, 15 are provided to retract the members 14, 15 after each brake application but are capable of being progressively deformed as wear of the pads 19 takes place. Springs 36 between the backing plate 18 and the fingers 34 retract the pads. Tongues 27, Fig. 2 (not shown), on, and bent at right-angles to the backing plates, which tongues are a slidable fit in a slot 33 in a keep member 32, and projections 30 on the backing plates engaged in recesses 32, retain the trailing edge 28 of the pad in abutting relationship with the face 29. A measure of damping which tends to eliminate brake squeal is provided due to the contact of the friction material itself with the abutment face. The lever 21 may be actuated by mechanical as well as by, or alternatively to, the pistoncylinder mechanism 22. Alternatively, hydraulic piston-cylinder assemblies on each side of the disc may be provided to actuate the pads. Other shapes of pads are described wherein the trailing abutting edge is arcuate having the centroid of the friction element as its centre.",DUNLOP RUBBER CO,DAVIS JOHN WALTER,,https://lens.org/179-654-938-587-899,Granted Patent,no,0,0,4,5,0,F16D65/092;;F16D65/092;;F16D55/2245;;F16D55/2245;;F16D65/52;;F16D65/52;;F16D2065/026;;F16D2065/026,F16D55/224;;F16D65/092;;F16D65/52,F2E EEL           ED24;;F2E EEL           EEL;;F2E EHB           EHB/;;F2E EX5           -;;F2E E1A1B         -;;F2E E1A1C         -;;F2E E1A1D2        -;;F2E E2N1A1        -;;F2E E2N1A4A2      -;;F2E E2N1A5        -;;F2E E2N1C2C       -;;F2E E2N1D12       -;;F2E E2N1D13       -;;F2E E2N1D16       -;;F2E E2N1D2D       -;;F2E E2N1D3B       -;;F2E E2N1D6A       -;;F2E E2N1D6B       -;;F2E E2N1D6C1      -;;F2E E2N1D6C2      -;;F2E E2N1E5        -;;F2E E2N1K1        -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

GIRLING Ltd. Oct. 5, 1960 [Aug. 1, 1959], No. 26493/59. Headings F2E and F2F. A pedal operated booster-assisted braking system for a vehicle incorporates a master cylinder so that on failure of the booster the capacity of the master cylinder is increased to provide the pedal with a length of travel greater than normal during application of the brake. A pedal operated rod 25 in normal use shifts inwardly a piston 23 having shoulders 26 and 27 which close one valve 38 previously venting a booster cylinder 16 through a port 31, and opens another valve 39 connecting the cylinder 16 through a path 29, 38 and 34 to a vacuum source 37. A booster piston 17 and an integral piston 18 operating in a master cylinder 10 are moved forward, the consequent increase in pressure closing a reservoir valve 54 and pressurizing a brake line 14. The booster piston 17 and pedal operated piston 23 are normally locked together by a radial latch-pin 45 which is maintained by the vacuum source 37 acting on a piston 44 in engagement with a groove in a sleeve 28 fast with the piston 23, the piston 44 being slidable in a radial cylinder fast with the piston 17.

Inertia switches. DUNLOP CO. Ltd. 24 April, 1968 [25 April, 1967], No 18973/67. Heading F2F. [Also in Division H1] An inertia-type deceleration responsive device e.g. for an anti-skid system comprises a flywheel 11, Fig. 2, mounted in an annular housing 2 on the gear-box output shaft 5. Teeth inside the flywheel mesh with three equally spaced gearwheels 9 driving cylindrical cams 8 having an inclined end surface 21 co-operating with tubular cams 20 to impart axial movement to a switching member 25 when the flywheel overruns the housing. The switch may be a magnetic reed switch, a pneumatic sensing device operating a switch or a light switch (arrangements are exemplified in the Specification). The switch is connected in a brake control circuit to release the brakes. In a modification, Fig. 8 (not shown), the teeth on the flywheel are formed on its outer periphery so that the flywheel lies within the gearwheels. In a second embodiment, Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 (not shown), a pinion 52 is secured to the cam member 57, on which the flywheel 50 is mounted, and meshes with teeth on the inner periphery 53 of an annular disc 54 provided with a series of magnets 56 on its circumference. A reed switch 60 is mounted on a stationary member 61 between magnets 56 and a second set 59 on an annular member 58 rotating with the housing 55. The arrangement of magnets is such that when the flywheel and housing rotate together, the reed switch is maintained open but is closed when the flywheel overruns the housing, as illustrated in Figs. 11, 12 (not shown). In another embodiment the flywheel is mounted on three flanged pulleys, Fig. 6 (not shown). An axially movable annular member (40) equivalent to member 25 in embodiment of Fig. 2, is connected with the flywheel by a thrust friction arrangement (41). In a further embodiment, Fig. 14, an annular flange 80 is mounted in the housing for limited angular movement relative thereto and is additionally connected between the flywheel 76 and housing by buttons 82 of friction material which contact the flywheel at one end and ramp surfaces 84 on the housing such that when the flywheel overruns the flange 80 is rotated with it a short distance. The flange 80 is connected to an axially slidable flange 85 by rods 94, Fig. 16 (not shown), so that on relative angular movement between the two flanges, caused by flywheel overrun, the flange 85 is moved towards the flange 80, causing a magnetic reed switch 90 to be closed.",DUNLOP CO LTD,DAVIS JOHN WALTER,,https://lens.org/194-582-073-468-324,Granted Patent,no,0,0,5,5,0,B60T8/74,B60T8/171;;B60T8/74,F2F FDA           FDA702;;F2F F200          F3(G;;F2F F208          -;;F2F F232          -;;F2F F338          F3(G;;F2F F354          F3(G;;F2F F390          F3(G;;F2F F392          F3(G;;F2F F412          F3(G;;F2F F456          F3(C;;F2F F458          F3(C;;F2F F702          FDA702;;H1N NET           NET;;H1N N330          QD;;H1N N345          QD;;H1N N355          NET;;H1N N360          NET;;H1N N360          QD;;H1N N367          NET;;H1N N367          QD;;H1N N616          NET;;H1N N616          QD;;H1N N650          NET;;H1N N650          QD;;H1N N703          NET;;H1N N703          QD;;H1N N744          NET;;H1N N744          QD,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A process for controlling the amount of insoluble gas trapped by a silicon melt is disclosed. After a crucible is charged with polycrystalline silicon, a gas comprising at least about 10% of a gas having a high solubility in silicon is used as the purging gas for a period of time during melting. After the polycrystalline silicon charge has completely melted, the purge gas may be switched to a conventional argon purge. Utilizing a purge gas highly soluble in silicon for a period of time during the melting process reduces the amount of insoluble gases trapped in the charge and, hence, the amount of insoluble gases grown into the crystal that form defects on sliced wafers.
