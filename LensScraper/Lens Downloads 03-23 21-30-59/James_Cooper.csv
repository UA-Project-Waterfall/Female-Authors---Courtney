As shown, each impedance comprises a resistor A2, K2, respectively shunted by a rectifier A3, K3 in series with a blocking condenser A5, K5. The circuit elements are so chosen and the biases applied to the rectifiers from potentiometers A4, K4 so set that for low frequencies the distortions introduced by the networks A, K balance out and the amplifier is linear. At higher frequencies, however, an additional condenser A1 shunting the anode load destroys the balance and causes the phaseshift to vary with signal amplitude. Additional variable resistors A6, K6 may be used in order to obtain a desired characteristic. As shown, the amplifier is preceded by a cathode-follower 2 with D.C.-restoring diode 3 in its grid circuit.

A linear amplifier in which the phase shift is a function of signal amplitude comprises a pair of non-linear amplifiers B, C, with their outputs and inputs in parallel, one of which is preceded by a time-delay circuit E. The signal is applied to a cathode-follower Al with D.C.-restoring diode A2 in its grid circuit, which feeds amplifier B through a time-delay circuit E of variable length and attenuation, and amplifier C through a variable attenuator C8. Each amplifier comprises two stages B1, B2 and C1, C2, respectively, in cascade and each stage is provided with a cathode feedback resistor, e.g. B4, shunted with a rectifier, e.g. B5, in series with a blocking condenser, e.g. B7. Each rectifier is supplied with an adjustable bias from a potentiometer, e.g. B6, the rectifiers being oppositely poled in the two stages of each amplifier and also in the corresponding stages of the two amplifiers. A D.C. restoring diode is provided in the grid circuit of each of the stages B2, C2. The outputs are combined in a common anode resistor D1 and are fed to the output via a cathode follower D2. The arrangement is so adjusted that with zero time-delay in the circuit E the overall input/output characteristic is linear. In a modification, the amplifiers are arranged in cascade, the timedelay circuit then being connected in parallel with one of them (Fig. 2, not shown). The arrangement is more particularly intended for use in colour picture transmission, to apply correction for non-linear phase distortion produced in the modulator.",MARCONI WIRELESS TELEGRAPH CO,COOPER VICTOR JAMES,,https://lens.org/162-074-739-078-022,Granted Patent,no,0,1,2,2,0,H04N9/646;;H04N9/646,H04N9/64,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   The present invention is for a multi-combination vehicle including a prime mover having an engine and at least one powered trailer mechanically coupled to the prime mover. A control system measures the relative motion or force between the two, preferably by the use of a load cell and accordingly adjusts the operation of the engine on the power trailer so that the powered trailer and the prime mover are synchronized in their movement. This allows a multi-combination vehicle to carry a significant load, by providing sufficient motive power without the potential for damage to the transmission and differential system of the prime mover.

Wide-band modulating potentials are superimposed in the grid circuit of a driven wide-band amplifier stage to which a narrow-band driving carrier-frequency amplifier is coupled through a constant impedance network comprising at least two sections. In one embodiment the driving amplifier V1 has an anode circuit L1, C1, sharply tuned to the carrier frequency input and coupled to inductance 2L1. (The numerical part of the references is not a multiplier but merely a distinguishing number.) The first network section comprises the elements L, C, R dimensioned so that #L/C=R. Inductance 2L1 is of such a value that it tunes capacitance C to the carrier frequency. Capacitance 2C1 is included to tune the inductance L to the carrier frequency. A second network section comprises elements 2L, 2C, 2R dimensioned as in the first section and capacitance 3C1 and inductance 3L1 are included to tune inductance 2L and capacitance 2C, respectively, to the carrier frequency. The wide-band modulating source M is included in the shunt arm 2C, 2R, across the input grid circuit of the wide-band driven amplifier V2. The second network section includes an effective resistance R which is presented by the whole network consisting of the elements L1, C1, 2L1, C, L, 2C1, and R connected between earth and the junction of 2C1 and 2L, and which is numerically equal, over the narrow band of the driving stage, to the value of the resistance 2R. A further similar embodiment is described in which the elements of the network are arranged differently and the input capacitance of stage V2 is tuned to the carrier frequency, Fig. 2 (not shown).",MARCONI WIRELESS TELEGRAPH CO,COOPER VICTOR JAMES,,https://lens.org/061-959-552-601-983,Granted Patent,no,0,0,4,4,0,H03C1/22,H03C1/22,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The present invention teaches measuring the relative delay between a plurality of signals which have suffered differing delays due to transmission, storage or other processing. The preferred embodiment of the invention includes the use of a marker which is generated in response to a second signal and combined with a first signal in a manner which ensures that the marker will not be lost in the expected processing of the first signal. Subsequently a first delayed marker is generated in response to the marker associated with or recovered from the first signal, and a second delayed marker is generated from the second signal.

[Also in Group XL (c)] In a balanced modulator for television signals the modulator output during line synchronizing pulses is passed through an electronic switch and the rectified out-. put of the switch applied as negative feedback to the input of one at least of the modulating valves so that the balanced modulated output at these instants is made zero. As shown, synchronizing pulses P and colour signals from a source 1 are applied through a phase splitter 2 in opposite phases to grids 3a of modulating valves 3 and subcarrier frequency from a source 8 applied through an amplifier 9 in opposite phases to suppressor grids 3b of the valves 3. The combined outputs of the valves 3, after suppression of any harmonics by a circuit 14 are applied to an output terminal 15 and to a switch valve 21 rendered conductive only during synchronizing pulses by pulses applied to its cathode from the source 1 through valves 18, 19. The sub-carrier frequency output of the switch 21 and also sub-carrier from the amplifiers 9, 22 may then be both applied to a rectifier 23-26 whose D.C. output variable corresponding to the sense of any unbalance of the modulating valves 3 is applied in series with the bias from source 20 to one of the modulating valves 3. The source 1 also passes its output to a synchronizing pulse separator valve 4a, whose anode circuit includes a delay line 4b with short-circuited remote end so that partly overlapping negative-going pulses and reflected positive-going pulses produce an output P<SP>1</SP> of alternately negative and positive-going narrow pulses, of which the negative-going are removed by a valve 4d, and positive and negative-going pulses derived from a phase splitter 4e and used as clamping pulses to connect the grids 3a of the modulating valves 3 to bias sources HT+ and 29 through D.C. restoring diode bridges 5a, 5b at back porch intervals succeeding the synchronizing pulses. The transformer winding 10a and amplifier 22a may be omitted so that the system only operates to correct errors in one sense. Also a reversing switch may be connected to the rectifier output so that the correction can be applied to either modulating valve",MARCONI WIRELESS TELEGRAPH CO,COOPER VICTOR JAMES,,https://lens.org/158-137-290-668-962,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H04N9/65,H04N9/65,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Television. MARCONI'S WIRELESS TELEGRAPH CO., Ltd. Oct. 17, 1952 [Feb. 11, 1952], No. 3614/52. Class 40 (3). [Also in Group XXXV] In a television or like installation of the kind in which a single carrier source is connected to the aerial or load through two or more channels, each giving an ouput of constant amplitude, phase relation at the common output is corrected and maintained by comparing the combined output with a standard output (a little below that which obtains when the outputs are exactly in phase), and using the resulting voltage to control the phase shift in one or more channels. As shown, the carrier source C.D. feeds two driver stages A1, A2, one in each channel, which feed modulating amplifiers B1, B2 whose output is combined in a mixer PM and fed to a load. The mixer output is also taken to a control circuit F for producing a D.C. potential responsive to departure from a predetermined level which may be fixed at 98 per cent of the level which would be obtained if the two channels were operating in phase agreement. The D.C. potential is thus applied in the corrective sense to the grid of a phase-control valve 1 associated with a condenser 4 in a tuned circuit 5 of the driver stage A2. Each of the amplifiers B1, B2, is provided with an automatic amplitude control circuit of the kind described in Specification 668,728, their output being rectified m gated rectifiers El, E2 and the resultants fed to control circuits D1, D2 which control the modulators C1, C2 so as to maintain constant the black levels in the outputs of each channel. Gating of the rectifiers El, E2 renders them effective only at the instants of transition from picture signal to sync. signal and vice-versa; and similar gating is provided for the control circuit F. The phase control system is applicable to television transmitters using either positive or negative picture signal modulation. In the latter case, the D.C. control potential may be derived from the combined output at PM by a peak voltmeter responsive to the positive-going sync. signals, and gating is not required.",MARCONI WIRELESS TELEGRAPH CO,COOPER VICTOR JAMES,,https://lens.org/193-099-919-485-552,Granted Patent,no,0,0,4,4,0,H04N5/38;;H04N5/38,H04N5/38,H3A AA            AA;;H4F FD30D         4-;;H4F FD30Q         4-,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The indicating means may be a gas discharge tube R6, mounted on an annular track R7 so as to be movable around the display tube to follow the rotating strobe AB, and energized from means responsive to the radar pulses from the transmitter T. Where additional means of identifying the vehicle S1 are needed, a second transmitting point B may be provided, producing a rotating beam BB in synchronism with beam AB, and energized, either by transmitter A or by its own transmitter. A rotating strobe representing beam BB may be provided on the display at A and transmitted for display on the vehicle in the same manner as the rest of the display, or signals representing the said rotating strobe may be electronically added to the energy transmitted from T. A second indicator R6<SP>1</SP> may be provided for indicating when the beam BB passes through the vehicle, and may be energized by means R5, in parallel with the first indicating means R6, when the frequencies of the two beams are the same, or, by separate frequency selective means R5<SP>1</SP> when the two frequencies are different. The transmitting point B may alternatively radiate a clockwise rotating overlapping-lobe equisignal beam, with the means energizing indicator R6<SP>1</SP> being responsive to an equality of received signal and the indicator R6<SP>1</SP> being a zero centre scale pointer indicating instrument, or a lamp indicating the passage of the equi-signal line through the vehicle. The invention may be used for airport traffic control.",MARCONI CO LTD,COOPER VICTOR JAMES,,https://lens.org/071-254-445-616-867,Granted Patent,no,0,4,1,1,0,G01S7/003,G01S7/00,H4D DSDX          SDX;;H4D D230          SDX;;H4D D230          3;;H4D D231          SDX;;H4D D231          3;;H4D D269          SDX;;H4D D269          3;;H4D D317          SDX;;H4D D317          3;;H4D D399          SDX;;H4D D399          3;;H4D D557          SDX;;H4D D557          3;;H4D D651          SDX;;H4D D651          3;;H4D D662          SDX;;H4D D662          3,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

MARCONI'S WIRELESS TELEGRAPH CO., Ltd. June 2, 1949 [Aug. 10, 1948], No. 21105/48. Class 40 (iii). [Also in Group XXXV] The "" black "" level in a television transmission system is maintained at a predetermined value by means of a control voltage derived from the modulated output of the system and utilized to control the modulation. The invention is applicable to a system of the kind in which the vision and synchronizing signals are transmitted as carrier variations on opposite sides of a predetermined level (i.e. the "" black "" level) and is described as applied to a transmitter such as that shown in Fig. 1 in which a radio-frequency carrier wave source A is fed to a grid modulated amplifier B to which is also fed the modulation signal from the modulator C. In accordance with the present invention the modulated output from B is rectified at E and fed to a circuit D from which a correcting control voltage is supplied to the modulation source C when the ""black"" level of the output from B departs from a predetermined value. Fig. 2 shows details of the circuit of D, Fig. 1, and comprises a first stage 3 which separates the synchronizing signals from the vision signals, the former signals then being differentiated in a stage 4 and limited in a further stage 5 to provide narrow pulses for the control of a Schmitt type relay comprising valves 6 and 7 which supplies short duration "" opening pulses to a gating valve 8 to allow a "" sample of the rectified modulated output (fed to valve 8 over conductor 9) to be passed to an amplifier 10. Succeeding amplifier 10 is a circuit including valves 11, 12 and 14 which provides the required controlling potential. This potential, which is developed across the cathode resistance of valve 14, is then fed to the modulation signal source, e.g. C, Fig. 1, to control its amplitude to compensate for variations in the D.C. level of the transmitted signal.",MARCONI WIRELESS TELEGRAPH CO,COOPER VICTOR JAMES,,https://lens.org/072-420-362-390-513,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,3,0,H04N5/06;;H04N5/165;;H04N5/06;;H04N5/165,H04N5/06;;H04N5/16,H4F FD30D         4-;;H4F FD30Q         4-,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

C. July 29, 1918. Exciting.-To minimize the lag or delay in regulation due to the self-induction of the fieldmagnet circuit of dynamo-electric machines, an additional winding a<x>, Fig. 1, is arranged on the field-magnet system of the main machine a and is connected in circuit with an additional winding d<2> on the exciter d, the windings a<x>, d<2> being connected also to a constant-potential source l. When the current flowing through the main field winding a<1> of the machine a is being increased by a manipulation of a regulating-resistance b in the circuit of the exciter main field winding d<1>, an electromotive force is induced in the current containing the coils a<x>, d<2> by transformer action of the winding a<1> on the winding a<x>, and the consequent alteration of the current through the winding d<2> has the effect of causing the exciter d to increase its voltage, producing an increased current in the winding a<1>. Similarly, decrease of current in the winding a<1> causes an automatic further decrease of voltage in the exciter d. In a modification, Fig. 2, the main machine a has one field-magnet winding a<x> connected to a source of exciting-current in series with an auxiliary machine f which may oppose or assist the voltage of the source l by suitable adjustment of the field regulator b ; additional windings a<1>, f<2> on the main and auxiliary machines are also connected together and to the source l.

MARCONI'S WIRELESS TELEGRAPH CO., Ltd. Jan. 30, 1956 [April 29, 1955], No. 12424/55. Class 40 (3). In colour television apparatus employing a signal of the colour subcarrier type and in which a subcarrier synchronizing "" burst "" occurs during the back porch following the line synchronizing pulse, a D.C. restorer circuit comprises a conventional diode restorer 2 connected to the grid of an amplifier 3, through which the video signals pass, together with a four-diode gate 10 which is arranged to sample the output of the amplifier for a period during the back porch and apply back a correcting potential to the amplifier grid. The input to gate 10 is derived via cathode follower 6 and the correcting potential output is applied via a further cathode follower 11. During the periods between sampling, the correcting potential persists since the leakage of voltage from the capacitance at grid of cathode follower 11 is negligible when the gate 10 is open. Pulses to control gate 10 are derived by separating positive-going sync. pulses from a video signal input at 31 in separator stage 32 and applying them to a short-circuited delay line 35. The combination of original and reflected pulses at a tap 36 results in a pair of oppositely-poled pulses of reduced duration (3 micro-seconds) for each sync. pulse. The second pulse of each pair, which is of positive polarity and may be arranged to occur a short while, for example, half a microsecond, after the sync. pulse termination, is selected by a valve 37 and applied to a phase splitter stage 38 to derive positive and negative pulses to control gate 10. If desired, A.C. coupling may be provided between amplifier 3 and cathode follower 6 provided the time-constant of the coupling is large compared with any unwanted variation it is desired to correct. In a modification, Fig. 2 (not shown), the coupling between the amplifier and cathode follower comprises a series combination of gas discharge tubes and a valve, the signal to the cathode follower being taken from across the valve. The gas discharge tubes present a high D.C. resistance and low A.C. resistance whereas the valve presents a low D.C. resistance and high A.C. resistance. Consequently only a small part of the D.C. voltage due to the coupling is applied to the cathode follower but a very large proportion of any A.C. voltage including variations it is desired to correct. A stage of D.C. amplification may be included in the feed-back loop.",MARCONI WIRELESS TELEGRAPH CO,COOPER VICTOR JAMES,,https://lens.org/093-425-825-614-451,Granted Patent,no,0,0,5,5,0,H04N9/72;;H04N9/72,H04N9/72,H4F FD1B1         3-;;H4F FD30D         3-,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Cooper, J. C. Sept. 6. Alarms, burglar and like.-Relates to door and window fastenings, and alarm devices therefor. Fig. 1 shows a door latch or lock. The bolt d, which may be single or double locking, is mounted in guides within a casing a attached to the door post, and is kept in position by a spring o. The bolt is pressed outwards by means of springs e. A plate f attached to a bolt is adapted to make contact with plates g so as to close an electric circuit. When the bolt is retracted, the circuit is broken and an alarm bell is sounded. The mechanism may be so arranged that, normally, the circuit is broken, and upon closing the circuit, by retracting the bolt, the alarm is sounded. The circuit may be connected to a telephone, so as to ring up the exchange when the bolt is operated. An electric wave, or mechanical means, may be employed to sound the alarm. The bolt d is retracted by means of a roller j, or by an inclined or curved block, mounted on the end of a pushrod i and adapted to engage an inclined or curved piece k on the bolt. The push-rod may be connected by a system of levers to a pedal-plate, so that it may be operated by the foot. A pair of rods, extending through the casing, may be arranged to operate the bolt by a pull from one side or a push from the other side. In a double-locking arrangement, a telescopic spring cushion n is mounted on the end of a lifting-rod n<1>, and is adapted to fall between the plate f and the end of the bolt, when the latter is shot, so that the circuit is broken or completed when the bolt is retracted. When applied to a railway-carriage door, the alarm serves to call the attention of the guard to any attempt made to open a door. Fig. 5 shows a sash fastening. A bolt p. enclosed in a casing p<2> attached to one of the sashes, is forced by a spring p<1> into engagement with a hole in a socket q attached to the other sash. The end of the hole and the tip of the bolt are screwed, or the hole may be provided with a slot or slots to engage a projection or projections on the bolt, and the wires h of an electric circuit containing an alarm are connected to the socket. By screwing in the bolt so as to secure the sashes, the circuit is completed. Should the bolt be withdrawn, the circuit is broken and an alarm is sounded. The socket may be provided with a number of holes, each fitted with circuit wires, so that the window may be secured in an open position to permit of ventilation. In the arrangement shown in Fig. 8, a number of recesses t, t<1> are provided in the side frame of one or both sashes, and are adapted to engage a spring catch t<2> mounted in the window frame. Upon moving the sash, the catch is forced back and breaks or closes an electric circuit so as to sound an alarm.",COOPER JAMES CHARLES,COOPER JAMES CHARLES,,https://lens.org/144-060-345-769-947,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Class 37 In a picture tube sound monitoring arrangement for a television system with accompanying sound, comprising means for producing pulses of sound dependent signals at a pulse repetition rate equal to the television line frequency, each of which occurs at or near the commencement of each scanning line; means are provided for combining the pulses with a saw tooth waveform of and synchronised with the television field frequency and for applying signals thus obtained to a television tube whereby a line extending in the framing direction and of a length dependent on the sound signal strength is displayed marginally of the picture area. Sound signals at terminals 1 after rectification and integration in unit 3 are gated by pulses of line frequency, derived from the line fly back pulses, and applied to terminal 5, into a combining circuit 6 fed with a frame-frequency, saw-tooth wave form at terminal 7. The output from a common cathode resistor 63 is applied to the picture tube through a limiter 8. The nature of the outputs from units 4 and 6 and the result of the latter are the picture screen for two different signals are described with reference to Figs. 2-7 (not shown). The line length, sound signal strength may be linear or logarithmic. In a further embodiment Fig. 8 the sound signal is applied to gating circuit V4, V5 through a peak rectifying circuit VI, V2 and an amplifier V3 and positive going spikes obtained from the output of line frequency valve V8 by differentiation and amplification in valve V9 are applied to the grid of V4. A saw tooth wave-form developed across a resistor FR in circuit with the deflection coils FS serves to gate the pour at frame frequency to produce a number of spikes which is a function of the audio amplitude and apply them via a monostable multi vibrator V6, V7, a blocking oscillator VII to the video input circuit of monitoring tube MT.",MARCONI WIRELESS TELEGRAPH CO,COOPER VICTOR JAMES,,https://lens.org/187-508-327-306-669,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,H04N17/00,H04N17/00,G1U UBV9A         UBV9A;;G1U U5A1          CD;;G1U U5A2          CD;;G1U U5B2          CD;;G1U U5C1          CD;;G1U U5MX          CD;;G1U U5M1B         CD;;G1U U5M16A        CD;;G1U U5M16B        CD;;G1U U5M19         CD;;G1U U5PX          CD;;G1U U5P6          CD,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A system and method are disclosed for identifying useless or insignificant documents in a document hit list assembled from documents stored in one or more document collection databases. A search engine is used to compose the document hit list based on a query presented by a user. A text extraction algorithm run by a processor is then used to process the documents identified by the document hit list to produce a table of terms and their corresponding collection-level importance ranking called the IQ or Information Quotient. The text algorithm also produces a table of the most important terms per document. The documents are also scanned independently and a table of documents with filenames and lengths is also produced. A summarizing text algorithm is also run by a processor against the documents of the document hit list to produce a table of terms having a high tf*idf value for each document. All of the tables are stored in a relational database, which allows the system of the present invention to generate a table of terms per document ranked by decreasing IQ. To determine whether a document is useful or useless, the table of terms and IQs, the table of most important terms per document, the table of documents with filename and lengths, and the table of high tf*idf values are examined.

Where two or more D.C. power supply units are fed through a common impedance from a source, a second common impedance is included in a common D.C. return path for the units to compensate, to a desired degree, for voltage variations due to the first common impedance. Rectifiers R1, R2 supplied from a common A.C. source M, supply loads RFD, HRF respectively. Variations in the voltage supplied to load RFD, due to variations of load HRF causing changes in volt-drop across a common impedance X, are compensated by introducing the volt-drop across a resistance Y in series with the supply to load RFD. By choice of resistance Y the voltage supply to load RFD which may be the H.T. load of the driver stage of a television transmitter is thus exactly over-, or under-compensated for variations of load HRF which may be the H.T. load of a modulated power amplifier stage of the transmitter. Common impedance X may be due to a voltage regulator associated with the A.C. source and resistance Y may be the lowest frequency section of a rectifier constant impedance filter network.

MARCONI'S WIRELESS TELEGRAPH CO., Ltd. July 5, 1956 [Oct. 24, 1955], No. 30320/55. Class 40 (3). In a television system the rate of transmission of brightness information is made substantially constant, irrespective of picture content, thus effecting a better utilization of available transmission bandwith. This is achieved by deriving from picture signals generated by conventional constant velocity scanning a further picture signal of the velocity modulated scan type in which the velocity of scanning is determined by changes in slope of the original picture waveform (i.e. by variations in the brightness content). As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, picture signals (a) derived by scanning a scene A with a conventional constant velocity scanning camera B are supplied to a picture tube J and there reproduced as a picture, also with constant velocity scanning, after a predetermined time interval determined by a delay device H in the picture signal circuit and a delay device H<SP>1</SP> in the scanning circuit. The reproduced picture is then rescanned by a camera tube K the scanning circuit L of which varies the velocity of scan in accordance with control signals supplied thereto. The control signals are produced in a quantizing circuit G which, in response to input signals (e) derived in a circuit F which differentiates a sawtooth wave (d) generated in E under the control of the twice differentiated (in C and D producing waveforms (b) and (c) respectively) signal (a) from camera B, supplies the waveform (f) consisting of a series of pulses which can occupy only N discrete amplitude levels (N being equal to 3 in the arrangement shown) each level being inversely proportional to the frequency content of the original signal and each pulse occurring after a fixed time after changes in slope in the original signal (a). The signal output of tube K when the velocity of scanning is controlled in accordance with the pulse train (f) is shown in curve (h) whence it can be seen by comparison with curve (g), which is identical with curve (a) delayed, that a better utilization of bandwidth results. To enable the signals from tube K to be reproduced at a co-operating receiver the scanning control signals (f) are also displayed on a picture tube M and scanned by a camera tube O operating with the same velocity modulated scan as tube K thus producing scanning control signals (j) which after modulation on to a sub-carrier in P are then employed together with the output of tube K to modulate a main carrier for transmissions from transmitter Q. At a co-operating receiver the picture signals (h) and scanning control signals (j) are separately derived in a conventional circuit S, the former signals being employed to modulate the intensity of the beam in reproducing tube U and the latter signals to control the velocity of the scanning waveform generated by unit V in accordance with their amplitude.

Without threat of flood the said long airway(s) 3 may be disassembled by lifting the said airways up ABSTRUCT (inStallation 3) The said Method of preventing flood water enter a lodgement by lifting artificial suction point up,( higher than possible level of flood water) may be used for brick -veneer lodgements that contain made for ventilation regular gaps( called- weep holes) between every 3 bricks in the row. The said weeps in conjunction with existed 'rain screen cavity' behind the brick' wall provide reasonable defence against rain' water but not so reliable - against flood water. It is even more important that any flood that covers weeps holes shuts down natural ventilation with not good consequences for a household. To avoid the said consequences, for the purpose to keep natural ventilation alive independently of flood level, the so called -'artificial air vent' has to be organised at height that is definitely higher than it is predicted by whether prognoses. The purpose can be served (see fig 3)by horizontal 1 and vertical 2 rectangular shape strips of, preferably, plastic material(or metal) with insulation 3 against the wall and preferably rectangular ditch 4 that may accommodate the height of said weeps between bricks along horizontal strips 2012 IO co8a and the horizontal strip 1 with weeps located above and against said weeps together with vertical strip 2 make 90 degrees elbow that has air enter opening at the top of vertical strip ( said 'artificial vent') for feeding the horizontal strip, that is closed from both sides and accumulates the air for feeding the house ventilation. The said 90 degrees elbow: In combination the vertical strip of the elbow represents the artificial vent (airway) that is located above the possible flood level and pumps air into the horizontal part of elbow that accumulates air for spreading it between said gaps (airways) for a lodgement's ventilation. A cap to protect the said airway and the entire device from being penetrated by dirt and rain is compulsory.",OMER COOPER JAMES;;OMER COOPER SIMON,OMER-COOPER SIMON;;OMER-COOPER JAMES,,https://lens.org/015-673-367-731-813,Limited Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,,E04H9/14;;E04B1/70,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

   A computer system is described where one or more processors executing operating system (OS) code and System Management (SM) code can access the same host interface of an embedded controller. The embedded controller, in turn, is coupled to one or more system devices such as an IDE power plane switch, a thermal A/D monitor, a System Management Bus (SMBus), etc. The embedded controller asserts a system management interrupt (SMI) to the system management environment of the processing unit(s) as well as a system control interrupt to the operating system environment of the processing unit(s). Accordingly, the processing unit(s) executing operating system code and system management code is able to control and/or monitor a number of system devices in the computer system by communicating with the embedded controller via its host interface and interrupts.

    A computer system is described where one or more processors executing operating system (OS) code and System Management (SM) code can access the same host interface of an embedded controller. The embedded controller, in turn, is coupled to one or more system devices such as an IDE power plane switch, a thermal A/D monitor, a System Management Bus (SMBus), etc. The embedded controller asserts a system management interrupt (SMI) to the system management environment of the processing unit(s) as well as a system control interrupt to the operating system environment of the processing unit(s). Accordingly, the processing unit(s) executing operating system code and system management code is able to control and/or monitor a number of system devices in the computer system by communicating with the embedded controller via its host interface and interrupts.

Each pixel, in lines of bicolored pixels of a raster scanned video image containing at least one object, is identified as to the object of which the pixel corresponds. Adjacent bicolored pixels of the same color across a line are grouped into corresponding numbered pixel groups. Pixel groups of the same color are downwardly grouped into numbered blobs of pixel groups. When a next line pixel group occurs which is of the same color with more than one previous line pixel group, the next line pixel group is grouped as part of first occurring previous line blob. Additional pixel group matches occurring between pixel groups of a previous and next line are upwardly grouped to provide a common ancestor blob number to each blob of the pixel group in each additional pixel group match.

The transistor stage closest to the lower potential is referred to as a driver stage, and all the other transistor stages are referred to as component stages. Blocking diodes are connected across all stages, forming a continuous path from the high voltage to ground. When an enable signal is provided to the driver stage, the transistor stages sequentially enter a conduction, starting with the driver stage and proceeding to the component stage coupled to the high voltage. The current flow through the driver stage is regulated and remains relatively constant as the high voltage is brought to close to the lower potential. The voltage drop is approximately linear, ensuring that voltage ringing or rebound does not occur following the discharge. After the high voltage is brought to the lower potential, the transistor stages remain in conduction as determined by the presence of the enable signal, to discharge any remaining high voltage that may be attached through a high series impedance. Upon removal of the enable signal, the transistor stages no longer conduct.",ELDEC CORP;;COOPER JAMES L;;ADAMS MARK,COOPER JAMES L;;ADAMS MARK,,https://lens.org/045-644-255-914-485,Patent Application,yes,3,0,7,7,0,H02H9/041;;H02H9/041,H02H9/04,,0,0,,,,PATENTED

The curtain arrangement 1 includes a curtain 2, which when not deployed is wound on a roller 4. The roller is provided within a headbox 6, in a ceiling 8. The curtain is provided with a bottom bar 10 which weighs the curtain for descent, but can also be used to close the headbox when the curtain is retracted onto the roller. Side guides 12 are also provided to contain side edges 14 of the curtain. They extend from the headbox 6 on the ceiling to the floor 18. The curtain is held in its retracted position on the roller, by a fusible link 20. An extension 22 of the roller 2 is provided extending out of the headbox 6. The fusible link 20 is provided between the outside of the headbox and the extension 22 of the roller. A peg 24 mounted on the headbox 6 holds one portion 26 of the fusible link, while the other portion 28 of the fusible link is connected to the extension. These portions are held together by a material 30 having a low melting point range typically between 57-150°C. This acts to hold the curtain on the roller under normal condition, preventing rotation of the roller within the headbox, but on sufficient temperature rise, the material 30 will melt, releasing the portions 26, 28 of the fusible link, allowing rotation of the roller and deployment of the curtain.",COOPERS FIRE LTD,COOPER ANDREW PAUL;;REED JAMES,,https://lens.org/183-055-186-060-348,Patent Application,no,0,0,13,13,0,A62C2/16;;A62C2/10;;A62C2/10;;A62C2/24;;A62C2/242;;E06B9/0692;;E06B9/80;;E06B5/16;;E06B9/0692;;E06B2009/807;;E06B2009/807,E06B5/16;;A62C2/10;;A62C2/24;;E06B9/80,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
