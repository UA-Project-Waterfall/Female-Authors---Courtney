Dean, T. E. May 16. Varnishing.-In apparatus for varnishing or sizing healds, shaft of healds d, e are mounted in a reciprocating frame b. As the frame moves to the right the healds e are supplied with varnish in the form of sprays or jets, as they pass between a funnel m<1>, and spraying or like devices l, l<1>, which are operated by compressed air. The healds then pass between revolving brushes f, g, which rub and consolidate the varnish. The brushes f, g are reciprocated vertically by a crank on a shaft h. When the healds have passed the devices l, l<1>, a stop o acts through levers p, q to draw a handle n to the right, and through arms n<1> to shut off the supply of varnish and compressed air from the spraying-devices l, l<1>. A stop u<1> effects the reverent of the motion of the frame by acting on ordinary gearing v. The healds d are then similarly treated. The handles n are moved by hand to admit varnish and compressed air to the spraying-devices. Auxiliary smootbing-brushes f<1> may act on the healds. These brushes consist of endless bands with their outer faces formed as brushes. Each band passes over three revolving pulleys y<1>, so arranged that the part of the brush acting on the healds is parallel thereto. The pulleys are mounted in a swinging frame which is acted on by a cam on the handle n, so that the brush f<1> is in action only during the varnishing operation. In another form of machine, the shafts of healds are mounted between two adjustable endless bands passing continuously over pulleys. Spraying-devices are mounted in advance of each set of brushes used. The bands may be moved intermittently to give greater time for each operation. The healds may be stationary, and the brushes and spraying-devices may be moved, the necessary flexible connections being provided. The spray may be applied either by hand before or during the brushing operation. The spraying and brushing operations may also be effected in different machines. The varnish may be applied to both sides of the healds, or may be sprayed upon the brushes by which it is applied to the healds.",DEAN THOMAS ELLIS,DEAN THOMAS ELLIS,,https://lens.org/080-610-497-161-117,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Strainer separators; baskets or drums; driving; charging and feeding; discharging.-The separator drum is provided with a movable top and a reciprocating piston for the ejection of deposits without stopping the machine, and the valves controlling the feed of the material to be treated, and the movement of the deposit-discharging devices, may be automatically operated. The invention is illustrated in two forms in Figs. 1 and 2. In that shown in Fig. 1, the drum 14 is carried by a frame 13 on a hollow shaft 9 and has an axially movable top 20 connected to a piston-like bottom plate 17 by webs 19. The filtering-material 21 is positioned transversely in the top 20 between perforated plates, the outlets for the liquid being pipes 23. Material to be treated is fed in by the pipe 29, and when sufficient deposit has accumulated in the drum, the parts 17, 20 are raised, and the part 17 forces the deposit out into the trough 42. The parts 17, 20 are raised and lowered by a piston 15 working in a cylinder 10. This cylinder 10 connects the part 9 of the main shaft with the part 8, with which it rotates, and is supplied on the upper side of the piston 15 with fluid led in through the hollow piston-rod 16, and on the underside, with fluid led in by the central pipe 18. All these parts rotate, and the pressure on the niston is due to the centrifugal force in the fluid. Spill-holes 45 and a leakage hole 50 are provided in the cylinder. While separation is proceeding, the top 20 is held tightly against a leakage-preventing ring 24, and the plate 17 is packed at the periphery by a fluidpressed ring 27. The trough 42 for the solids is preferably mounted to rotate, so that the solids may be removed from it by a scraper 51. The separated liquid is caught in a trough 41, from which it is led by a pipe 46 to a trough 43, and thence out of the machine. Bearings 3, 4, 5 are provided for the shaft. The liquid for actuating the piston 15 is supplied by pipes 31, 32 connected as shown, and having regulating-valves 33, 34. The machine may be made automatic in operation by opening and closing the pipes 29, 31, 32 automatically at suitable times. This may be effected by valves 38, 39, 40 controlled electrically. The switch 61 has strips 66, 67, 68 wired to the valve solenoids as shown, and a contact-arm 65 carried by a shaft 60 rotated at constant speed by clock-work or other means. In the modification shown in Fig. 2, the top 98 and bottom 96 of the centrifugal drum are moved by a piston 95 in a cylinder 91, which is supplied with fluid under pressure from a pipe 73 by connexions 84, 74. The cylinder 91 also acts as,belt pulley for the main drive. The pipes 73, 74 and the feed-pipe 75 have regulating-valves 78, 79, 81, and the machine may be made automatic by providing valves 82, 83 controlled electrically by a switch 114, the arm 118 of which is rotated at constant speed by a motor 117 through gearing 116, 115. The filtering-medium, in this modification, comprises a coarse screen 103, a fine screen 105, and intermediate granular filtering- material 104, such as sand. One or both screens 103. 105 may be omitted if the granular filter will stay in place. The material 104 may be supplied and packed by centrifugal force while the machine is running, by closing the valve 81 and opening the valve 80 in the sand and water pipe. The outer layer of the filter may be charcoal For removing the filter 104, the plate 109 on the drum is detachable. The trough 110 for the discharged solids rotates, a fixed scraper 111 being provided.",BROWN THOMAS ELLIS,BROWN THOMAS ELLIS,,https://lens.org/036-076-150-774-093,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B04B3/02,B04B3/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Road-traffic signals on vehicles. VULGARIAN ENGINEERS, Ltd. Feb. 22, 1955 [Feb. 22, 1954], No. 5207/54. Class 118 (2). A direction indicator suitable for a pedal cycle comprises a rigid strip of metal forming a closed loop, and an indicating member pivotally mounted in the loop so as to swing on either side thereof, which loop and indicating member are provided with corresponding contours so that the latter may lie snugly within the former. The ends 12, 13 of a metal strip bent into a loop having the same shape as that of a translucent indicator 11 overlap one another and accommodate an adjustable socket 14 for a control cable 15. The indicator 11 is pivoted between a pin 43 provided in the bottom part of the metal loop frame and on an adjustable threaded plug 28 in the upper part of the frame. The plug 28 has a conical end engaging a conical recess 32 in the metal plate 30 closing the top of translucent trough-shaped member 11. The control cable 15 passes round and is secured to a pulley 46 carried by pivot pin 43. A pin 48 extends from pulley 46 to engage a hole in the bottom of indicator 11. The loop frame is provided with curved clip members 61 and 62 for securing it to the rear mudguard of the cycle. The cable 15 also passes around another pulley inside a casing 52 having a clip 53 for attachment to the handle-bars of the cycle. This pulley is rotatable by means of a lever 58. A battery 26 is carried on top of the loop frame and is connected to a contact pin 25 which extends through the hollow centre of plug 28 to the inside of indicator 11. The end of contact pin 25 is flattened at 33 and lies between the arms of a springy metal fork member 34 which is connected to one side of a lamp 40 carried within indicator 11. When the indicator arm 11 is swung to either side of the loop frame by operation of lever 58 contact between the fork member 34 and flat end 33 of contact pin 25 causes lamp 40 to light up, the return circuit being through the metal plate 30 and the frame of the device.

Locks, key; escutcheons, keyhole.-The first part of the invention relates to a padlock. The bow H is connected at one end by a link to a pivoted disc B, and at the other end it has a slotted hole adapted to receive a pin P passing through a hole in the casing. The disc B is provided with indents x, y adapted to be engaged by a spring-controlled pawl F. When locked, the pawl engages the indent x, and the pin P engages the holes in the bow and casing. In unlocking, the pawl F is moved out of engagement with the disc, by means of a key E, and is afterwards released, the bow is then pulled out, thereby turning the disc until the pawl engages the indent y. In this position the slots in the hole in the bow and in the holes in the casing are brought into line so as to allow a projection on the pin P to pass. The pin can now be withdrawn, until it engages the slot in the front plate, and the bow H is free. The locking is performed by a reverse operation. The second part of the invention relates to a keyhole guard and a blocking-device for the mechanism, and is applicable to any lock. A keyhole cover A, provided with a long and a short recess, is adapted to slide on a dovetailed projection on the front plate of the lock. A spring-controlled sliding piece K, mounted on the back of the front plate, has a projecting part passing through the plate and, normally, engaging the short recess. A piece W, prevented from rotation by contact with a stop, forms a nut for the engagement of a screw R, passing through the front plate. This piece W may be moved by rotating the screw so as to bring it in position for locking some part of the lock mechanism, such as the pawl F. In operation, the cover A is raised to expose the keyhole. The key is inserted and turned to pass the end of a pivoted lever L. The key is then turned to depress the lever L, which engages the piece K and slides it forward into engagement with the long recess in the cover A. The cover is forced downwards, after the withdrawal of the key, and the head of the screw is exposed. The screw may now be operated to release the piece W from engagement with the lock mechanism.

By using relatively minor perturbations, the phase of a transmission line section can be controlled without drastically altering the impedance of the section, thereby maintaining good impedance matching properties. Also, by keeping the alternate current paths small, generally fine control of phase shift is possible along with allowing the design to remain relatively simple. Such tunable elements can then be incorporated in designs where resonators (or other elements) are separated by specific phase lengths to construct other signal processing functions, such as filters.",ELLIS THOMAS J,ELLIS THOMAS J,,https://lens.org/034-834-636-297-511,Patent Application,yes,5,1,1,1,0,H01P1/203;;H01P1/203,H01P1/18,333/161;;333/164,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The eccentric or its equivalent may be so slotted or shaped that it may engage with a correspondingly-shaped part of the steering-stem to form a steering-lock. Means for locking the wheels are also described. A tubular boss is applied to the hub or other outer bearing. A hollow threaded pin, having its end recessed for operation by a special key, works inside the boss, and its end is adapted to work through the oil-hole and bear against the shaft to prevent rotation.

When the vessels A, B, C, D, which are mounted on individual spindles 1, are in the position shown by the dotted lines in Fig. 1, the piston 16 is at the top of the cylinder 7, and a pressure fluid is admitted through a pipe 28, the shaft 9, holes 38 in the sleeve 17, and ducts 39 in the piston 16 to the upper side of the piston, where, by its centrifugal pressure, it forces down the piston and by means of the sleeve 17 and head 18 presses down the rollers 19 and turns the vessels A, B, C, D into the position shown in full lines. The materials to be separated are then admitted by the valve 26 and pipe 25 into the spouts 21 and the separating-vessels, the liquid passing through the strainer and filter 22 on to shields 24 and trough 50. The valve 26 is then shut off, and after,a lapse of time sufficient to dry the solids accumulated on the filter 22, the operating-fluid is again admitted from the pipe 28 with such rapidity as to exceed the amount which can flow out through the leakage holes 41. The cylinder of liquid above the piston then extends inwardly until it passes through the holes 42 to the underside, balancing the pressure above, so that the centrifugal forces of the vessels A, 13, C, D are unbalanced, and the vessels turn on their spindles to the position shown in dotted lines, the contained solids being discharged centrifugally into a revolving trough 52. The vessels A, B, C, D are then restored to their original position by reducing the supply of operating-fluid, and the process is recommenced. The timing of the successive steps may be controlled automatically by a. contact-arm 43 rotating at a uniform speed over contact plates 45, 46, 47 connected with solenoids actuating valves. 33, 27, 34. In a modification, the separating-vessels are arranged to be turned on axes parallel to the spindle 9 by an oscillating- vane motor, and hydraulic instead of electric operation of the valves is employed, the timing being effected by a uniformly rotating valve controlling the distribution of the hydraulic pressure. One cr more washing stages may be introduced into the process. Upper and lower bearings 10, 11 are provided for the shaft 9, the weight of the machine being carried on a thrust bearing 14 supported on an oscillating frame 2, which, with the balls 3 and base-plate 4, forms a self-balancing device. The Specification as open to inspection under Sect. 91 (3) (a) states that imperforate vessels may be used with the apparatus described, the process being one of decantation instead of filtration. This subject-matter does not appear in the Specification as accepted.",BROWN THOMAS ELLIS,BROWN THOMAS ELLIS,,https://lens.org/044-878-252-786-065,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,B04B5/02,B04B5/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Making circular saws; rolling. EDGAR ALLEN & CO. Ltd. Nov. 22, 1961 [April 8, 1961], No. 12726/61. Classes 83 (2) and 83 (4). [Also in Group XXIII] In the manufacture of a circular saw of the integral tooth type, a steel disc is heated progressively around its periphery, the metal is swaged into a space that increases in width towards the periphery of the disc, and the disc is cooled. The periphery of the motor-driven disc 1 is heated by oxygen and propane fed heaters 35B and passes between rolls 6B which are held in contact with and driven by the disc 1. A freely rotatable roll 26 acts on the edge of the disc to displace the periphery into a space formed by the chamfered edges 6AA and 6BB of rolls 6A and 6B. The disc and all three rolls are mounted on screw adjusted slides. The disc is cooled by water jets 53 and by further jets situated radially inwardly of the heater nozzles. The roll 26 may be cylindrical or barrel-shaped, or alternatively an impacting tool may be used to swage the disc. After swaging, equi-angled, double-angled, or single-angled teeth may be cut in the disc.",EDGAR ALLEN & CO LTD,CAWLEY THOMAS EDWARD;;ELLIS JOSEPH,,https://lens.org/055-426-179-657-700,Granted Patent,no,0,0,4,4,0,B23D65/00;;B23D61/02,B23D61/02;;B23D63/00,B3M MG            MG;;B3M M21           MG;;B3M M22           MG;;B3M M8            MG;;B3M M9J           MG;;B5L LEB           LEB;;B5L L102          LEB,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Transformers and inductors; electric conductors; electric coils. REYNOLDS METALS CO. June 27, 1960, No. 22457/60. Headings H1A, H1P and H1T. [Also in Division H2] A conductor, which may be wound into a coil such as 10, for transformers, comprises layers of insulated and uninsulated strips, e.g. 13, 15, of aluminium and/or copper, such that the insulated strips are thin and can readily be coiled without cracking the insulation. The insulation 14, e.g. of aluminium oxide, may extend over one face, where the uninsulated strip 15 touches the uninsulated face, Fig. 2, or both faces, Fig. 4. In the first case the strips form a single conductor between terminals 11, 12 and in the second case they may form separate circuits. The bare strips are narrower but of greater section from the insulated ones, and the insulation 14 extends over the edges of strips 13 to prevent edge arcing. A coil with three separated conductors has a completely insulated strip 47, a half-insulated strip 48 and a bare strip 51. Multiplication of the uninsulated strips increases the area of the conductors for heavy duty. In this case, extra bare strips may contact the uninsulated face of the halfinsulated strip (Fig. 6a, not shown).",REYNOLDS METALS CO,STALEY JOHN;;LEWIS THOMAS ELLIS,,https://lens.org/010-674-991-966-686,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H01F5/00,H01F5/00,H1P PHC           PHC,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

[Also in Groups XXXV and XXXVI] A flat-strip conductor, especially suitable for electrical coils, is formed by folding over the burred edges of a cut strip of metal to form rounded edges which, together with at least a part of the non-folded outer surface, are provided with an insulating covering. The preferred conductor comprises an aluminium foil strip with a coating formed by anodizing after folding, the coating extending around both edges and continuing across the unfolded outer surface. It may be formed by feeding the cut strip from a roll 30 through folding rolls 31 which fold the edges inwards and then through an ironing roll (not shown) which flattens the folded strip. It is then fed over guide roller 32 which directs it into tight engagement with an electrolytic roller 33 rotating in an electrolytic bath 34 containing e.g. a 15-18% aqueous solution of sulphuric acid. The roller 33 has a specially formed and partly masked surface (Fig. 7 and 8, not shown) so that only that part of the conductor which is to be anodized is in contact with the solution, and a plurality of suitably shaped cathodes 36 are provided. Suitable current densities and treatment times are given in the Specification. The strip then passes through a rinsing tank 51, a hot water sealing tank 52, and a pressurized-steam-sealing container 53, being finally fed by drive rolls 54 on to a storage spool 55.",REYNOLDS METALS CO,STALEY JOHN;;LEWIS THOMAS ELLIS,,https://lens.org/074-463-227-968-469,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,H01F41/122,H01F41/12,C7B BCCD          CCD;;C7B BGC           GC80;;C7B B124          GC80;;C7B B283          GC80;;C7B B320          GC80;;C7B B325          GC80;;C7B B536          GC80;;C7B B770          GC80;;C7B B806          GC80;;C7C CA199;;C7C CA253;;C7C CA308;;C7C CA327;;C7C CA541;;C7C CA566;;C7C CA587;;C7C CA60X;;C7C CA613;;C7C CA615;;C7C CA618;;C7C CA62X;;C7C CA623;;C7C CA626;;C7C CA63X;;C7C CB170;;C7C CB195;;C7C CB196;;C7C CB223;;C7C CB224;;C7C CB238;;C7C CB296;;C7C CB297;;C7C CB339;;C7C CB464;;C7C CB477;;C7C CB478;;C7C CB48X;;C7C CB48Y;;C7C CB481;;C7C CB504;;C7C CB513;;C7C CB530;;C7C CB531;;C7C CB584;;C7C CB588;;C7C CB597;;C7C CB598;;C7C CB615;;C7C CB617;;C7C CB618;;C7C CC681;;C7C CC695;;C7C CC698;;C7C CC711;;C7C CC712;;C7C CC714;;C7C CC72Y;;C7C CC721;;C7C CC722;;C7C CC724;;C7C CC728;;C7C CC738;;C7C CC74X;;C7C CC74Y;;C7C CC743;;C7C CC748;;C7C CC75X;;C7C CC755;;C7C CC762;;C7C CC783;;C7C CC785;;C7C CC786;;C7C CC790;;C7C CC793;;H1P PHC           PHC,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   Improved encapsulated, overmolded and/or underfilled electrical components having a complete encapsulation, overmolding and/or underfilling with a coefficient of thermal expansion that is uniform and substantially free of gradients includes a polymeric matrix and an inorganic filler having a platelet geometric structure. The platelet structure of the filler allows a desirable coefficient of thermal expansion to be achieved using a very low level of filler material. This low level of filler material facilitates lower viscosity during forming of the encapsulation and/or overmolding, thereby facilitating complete filling of a mold cavity and underfilling of space between a circuit board and a semi-conductor chip electrically connected to the circuit board. In addition, the low viscosity has processing advantages that reduce the potential for damage to electrical components during encapsulation, overmolding and/or underfilling.

MINISTER OF TECHNOLOGY. 18 March, 1969 [26 March, 1968], No. 14588/68. Heading B5A. [Also in Division F2] Bearing members having frusto-conical surfaces are made by machining a bearing surface on one of the members, casting bearing material against the surface to form a bearing surface which adheres to a second bearing member and separating the members. The machined bearing surface may be treated to prevent the bearing material adhering to it. A frustoconical male member 10 having an accurately machined surface 14 is mounted on a shaft 12 on which is coaxially mounted a female member 11 having a conical recess 15, there being a P.T.F.E. bush 13 disposed between the shaft and the female member. The surface 14 of member 10 is coated with silicon wax and a resin 19 is poured into the conical recess. The male member is moved along the shaft in the direction A causing the resin to fill the space between the members. The thickness of the layer of bearing material is determined by the end face 16 of the member 10 abutting the bush 13. A sleeve 17 is slid along the outside of the female member to shear off any excess resin, and engages with the flange 18 of the male member to align the bearing members. After the resin has set the male member is removed, the bush 13 replaced by a spacer 22 and the male member is replaced on the shaft, the bearing clearance being determined by the length of the spacer. The resin may be an epoxy resin which may contain aluminium oxide and carbon fibres. The cast bearing surface may be provided with grooves, in which fluid may be pressurized during operation of the bearing, by casting the bearing material between the female member and a member identical with the male member except that it has on its surface a raised pattern corresponding to that of the groove pattern required, this member being replaced, after the material has set, by a member having a smooth surface.",MINI OF TECHNOLOGY,ELLIS THOMAS LEONARD;;FADDY DAVID JOHN,,https://lens.org/014-748-040-451-526,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,F16C33/201;;F16C33/02,F16C33/02;;F16C33/20,B5A AB18          AB18P;;B5A A1R130        AB18P;;B5A A1R14A        -;;B5A A1R14C2       -;;B5A A1R14D        -;;B5A A1R164        AB18P;;B5A A1R214A       AB18P;;B5A A1R214D       AB18P;;B5A A1R214H       AB18P;;B5A A1R30         -;;B5A A1R314C1B     AB18P;;B5A A1R314C2S     AB18P;;B5A A1R44         -;;B5A A1R444        AB18P;;B5A A1R64         -;;B5A A20T3         AB18P;;F2A AD06          AD06;;F2A A6B           AD06,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Making coils, welding by pressure, shearing and perforating. REYNOLDS METALS CO. Oct. 20, 1965, No. 44489/65 Headings B3A, B3R and B3W. A strip conductor coil 30 is wound from conductive strip 31 and insulating strip 39 on an insulating core 32. The supply rolls 40, 41 are mounted on free wheeling rollers 44, 45 respectively and the strips pass over turning bars 46, 47 respectively. Each roller is fitted with an adjustable spring-loaded brake (201), (202), (203) (Fig. 4, not shown) which are connected to lever arms (48), (49) loaded by adjustable springs 52, 53, respectively and on which are respectively mounted the bars 46, 47. A mandrel 63 is advanced by a fluid pressureoperated piston-rod 64 into a retainer 96 of a hopper 70 where it picks up a core 32. The mandrel is withdrawn and rotated to the station 67 whereupon it is again advanced, a clutch member (81) (Fig. 18, not shown) on the mandrel engaging a mating clutch member (82) on the end of a drive shaft 60. A taping head 139 holds the strips 31, 39 together on a table (138) (Fig. 24, not shown) and applies a length of adhesive tape (141) to the strip (31) and to the core (32) (Fig. 25, not shown). The shaft 60 is rotated to wind the coil and when almost fully wound is stopped. Two parallel strips of contact material 103 are advanced by members 109 so as transversely to overlie the strip 31 to form leading and trailing contacts (33), (34) respectively. The underneath of the strips 103 is cleaned by brushes 119. A die block 57 is lowered driving a rod 123 downwardly until it abuts a block 131 whereupon projections 134 cold weld the contact strip to the strip 31. Simultaneously a member 135 perforates the strip between the contacts (Fig. 2, not shown). The strips are further advanced until the trailing contact (34) is under the taping head 139, which is then lowered to hold the strips against the table 138 (Fig. 21, not shown). A second taping head 140 is lowered on to the coil to apply a tape thereto and the shaft 60 is again rotated so that the strip is ruptured at the perforations. The mandrel 63 is moved to the station 68, where its resistance is checked and if it is unsatisfactory it is removed from the mandrel by a stripping mechanism 72. If the coil complies with the test it is removed from the mandrel at station 69 by a stripping mechanism 73, where it falls into a hopper.",REYNOLDS METALS CO,LEWIS THOMAS ELLIS;;LIGHTNER ROBERT BRUCE,,https://lens.org/143-570-038-138-460,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H01F41/063,H01F41/06,B3R R1            -;;B3R R10           -;;B3R R17X          -;;B3W W10LY         -;;B3W W10L4C        -;;B3W W22           -;;B3W W27           -;;B3W W46A          -;;B3W W8HY          -;;B3W W8H4C         -;;B3W W9AY          -;;B3W W9A4C         -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A shank portion extends from the head portion and includes a plurality of expansible prongs on its distal end which protrude out from the opposite end of the panel members. The shank portion includes at least a first area of substantially constant diameter and a second area of decreased diameter less than that of the first area which is not in contact with the panel members when the drive rivet is received therein. A generally elongated bore is formed within the drive rivet which is adapted for receiving an expander pin. The expander pin is driven through the elongated bore which urges the expansible prongs outward, which causes the shanks second area of decreased diameter into engagement with the panel members, in order for securing the panel members in the fastened position.

The frequency and depth of modulation are chosen to avoid phase locking the laser output pulses to the modulating signal, the choice being made empirically, i.e. by measuring the modulation power required to phase lock the output and subsequently maintaining the power below this level. The selfinduced pulses occur in the microwave region with pumping energies of 1À1-3 times the laser threshold; temperature ranges of 77-110‹ K. are quoted for a GaAs injection diode laser. The pulses apparently occur because of dispersion in the semi-conductor and locking between longitudinal modes. The device is located in a microwave transmission line for coupling to a modulating source, so that the incident modulating microwaves alter the pumping current. The modulation power is around 1 mw. The variation of the output pulse position with the modulating signal may be adjusted by choice of the size of the diode heat sink. The modulating signal may also be used to vary the pumping energy of semi-conductor lasers which are pumped optionally or by an electron beam. Feedback may be applied to stabilize the pulse width, the feedback being electrical, optical or electro-optical as in Specification 1,266,086. Several lasers may be used in a multiplex communication system, and the lasers may have differing output frequencies as in Specification 1,266,084.",WESTERN ELECTRIC CO,PAOLI THOMAS LEE;;RIPPER JOSE ELLIS,,https://lens.org/094-995-593-390-700,Granted Patent,no,0,0,11,11,0,H01S5/06216;;H01S5/06216;;H01S5/0658;;H01S5/0658,G02F1/00;;G02F1/015;;H01S5/06;;H01S5/062;;H01S5/065,H1C CBX           CBX;;H1C CE            CE;;H1C CE            CEA;;H1C CEA           CEA;;H1C C22Y          -;;H1C C23Y          -;;H1C C230          CEA;;H1C C231          CEA;;H1C C233          CEA;;H1C C25Y          -;;H1C C252          CEA;;H1C C26Y          -;;H1C C35Y          CEA;;H1C C352          CEA;;H1C C353          -;;H1C C36Y          -;;H1C C361          -;;H1C C366          -;;H1C C39Y          -;;H1C C392          CEA;;H1C C402          CEA;;H1C C416          CEA;;H1C C42X          CEA;;H1C C422          CEA;;H1C C470          CEA;;H1C C475          CEA;;H1C C476          -;;H1C C477          -;;H1C C48Y          CEA;;H1C C480          -;;H1C C508          CEA;;H1C C52Y          -;;H1C C523          -;;H1C C530          -;;H1C C569          CEA;;H1C C63Y          -;;H1C C630          CEA;;H1C C640          CEA;;H1C C641          CEA;;H1C C647          CEA;;H1C C648          CEA;;H1C C66Y          CEA;;H1C C660          CEA;;H1C C666          CEA;;H1C C670          CEA;;H1C C671          CEA;;H1C C673          CEA;;H1C C674          CEA;;H1C C675          CEA;;H1C C707          -;;H1C C712          CEA;;H1C C720          CEA;;H1C C723          CEA;;H1C C724          CEA;;H1C C73Y          -;;H1C C74Y          CEA;;H1C C741          CEA;;H1C C747          CEA;;H1C C77Y          CEA;;H1C C78Y          CEA;;H1C C783          CEA;;H1C C784          CEA;;H1C C785          CEA;;H1C C799          CEA;;H1K KEAX          EAX;;H1K KELX          ELX;;H1K K1EA          EAX;;H1K K1EA1         EAX;;H1K K1EB          EAX;;H1K K2R3A         EAX;;H1K K2S1D         EAX;;H1K K2S2D         EAX;;H1K K2S23         EAX;;H1K K2S27         EAX;;H1K K4C1R         EAX;;H1K K5B2          EAX;;H1K K9A           EAX;;H1K K9N2          EAX;;H1K K9N3          EAX;;H1K K9R2          EAX,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Nov. 13. Machines for separating liquids from solids by density; drums. - In a continuous-action centrifugal machine for separating solids from liquids, the supplying-means and the outlets from the separating-chamber are so arranged that a vacuous space exists in the chamber near the axis in order to prevent the escape of liquid from the outlet for the solids. In the construction shown in Fig. 1, a number of chambers 10 are arranged about a central hollow shaft 1 and are fed by pipes 11, the supply of the material to be treated being controlled by a valve 38 on a float 41, and a throttle - valve 42. The solids outlet 12 is turned inwards and upwards into the pipe 14 and is thus sealed. The liquid outlet pipe 28 passes upwards and outwards to a seal 31 and open trap 30 so that atmospheric pressure exists in the chamber 10 at about the region a a<1>. The liquid is delivered by a pipe 33 into a trough 34. The solid in the pipe 14 is removed by a worm 16 driven by gearing 18, 19, 21, 22 into a chamber 25. Any liquid separated in the pipe 14 is taken back into the chamber 10 by a pipe 45. In the modification shown in Fig. 3, a single annular chamber 10<a> is employed. The material is delivered by pipes 11<a> into a trap 9<a>, a filter 50 being interposed between the chamber 10<a> and the clear liquid side. The pressure within the chamber is adjusted automatically by a piston or diaphragm controlled throttle-valve 38<a> arranged as shown, which controls the clear-liquid outlet 28<a>. The liquid is collected in a trough 34<a>. The separated solids pass around a sealing-bend 12<a>, and over a surface 14<a> to a filter 51, and are then delivered to a rotary trough 37<a> from which a stationary scraper 64 removes them. A pipe 53 removes liquid separated at the filter 51. A differentially rotating sleeve 20<a> carries scrapers 24<a>, 16<a>, and a brush 52 for facilitating the removal of deposited solids, and also a brush for cleaning the filter 50. For cleaning the machine, the valve 61 is closed, and the valve 62 opened. Clean water is introduced by a valve 63, and the machine is rotated. A pet cock 19<a> is provided to allow air to escape when the machine is being primed prior to rotation. In a modification of the construction shown in Fig. 3, the filter 50 and regulating- valve 38<a> are dispensed with.",RAASLOFF HARALD DE;;BROWN THOMAS ELLIS,RAASLOFF HARALD DE;;BROWN THOMAS ELLIS,,https://lens.org/130-311-516-014-094,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,B04B11/02,B04B11/02,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

In another form, the rivets for securing the chains comprise short lengths of metal tubing flattened to leave two eyes at each side, the eyes on one side embracing the links, and those on the other being threaded on a cord or the like embedded in the cover or band. A raised part of the tread may be provided between the rows of chain, or the chains may lie in grooves in the tread. The tread may be grooved or corrugated. The chains may be so arranged that they only come into action when the tyre is not fully inflated.

The new system makes no attempt to separate individual workpieces for counting purposes, enabling operations to be carried out at greater speeds. Counting of workpieces in an unseparated group of such workpieces is accomplished by electronic measurement of movement of the centrifugal feeder between the leading and trailing edges of a group of unseparated workpieces.

The closure member, which comprises a spigot 4 screwed into a cylindrical boss 2 on the container 1, has a blind bore 5 which at its open end registers with a bore 3 which leads to the interior of the container. The spigot is weakened by a circumferential notch 6, and the cover 8 is provided with an inclined wall 11 so that when the cover is knocked downwards, the wall 11 engages the top of the spigot and. breaks it along the notch 6. To prevent accidental operation of the extinguisher the cover 9 is held in the inoperative position by means of a withdrawable pin 29. A pin 19 in the cover 8 engaging a slot 18 in the boss 2, prevents the cover from being blown off by pressure of escaping liquid.

    A test bench generation technique is described in which a simulation of test operation is performed using a full subsystem circuit model 2  and full surrounding circuit models 4, 6,  and 8.  The input and output signals are recorded as a print on change file 10.  This print on change file is used in combination with a classification of whether signals are inputs, outputs or bidirectional and associated rules for outputs and bidirectional signals when outputs to establish a reduced model concentrating on the interaction between the subsystyem circuit under test and the surrounding circuit elements. This reduced model 34  replays input data and applies rules to output data rather than actually modelling the full behaviour of the surrounding circuits. The rules associated with output signals can involve time windows, strobing relationships, settling times and settled times amongst other characteristics.

The program guide also provides users with an opportunity to designate gift recipients for whom programs may be recorded.,ELLIS MICHAEL D;;THOMAS WILLIAM L;;LEMMONS THOMAS R;;UNITED VIDEO PROPERTIES INC,ELLIS MICHAEL D;;THOMAS WILLIAM L;;LEMMONS THOMAS R,ROVI GUIDES INC (2014-11-24);;TV GUIDE INC (2014-11-24);;UV CORP (2014-11-24);;UNITED VIDEO PROPERTIES INC (1999-07-01),https://lens.org/142-907-575-553-488,Patent Application,yes,8,0,158,158,0,H04N21/2143;;H04N21/23113;;H04N21/2318;;H04N21/2543;;H04N21/25435;;H04N21/262;;H04N21/2747;;H04N21/4334;;H04N21/4335;;H04N21/47202;;H04N21/47208;;H04N21/47214;;H04N21/482;;H04N21/4821;;H04N21/6175;;H04N21/643;;H04N21/6581;;H04N21/6587;;H04N21/812;;H04N21/8586;;H04N21/47;;H04N7/17318;;H04N7/17336;;H04N21/2143;;H04N21/23113;;H04N21/2318;;H04N21/2543;;H04N21/25435;;H04N21/262;;H04N21/4335;;H04N21/47208;;H04N21/47214;;H04N21/482;;H04N21/4821;;H04N21/6175;;H04N21/643;;H04N21/6581;;H04N21/6587;;H04N21/812;;H04N21/8586;;H04N21/2747;;H04N21/4334;;H04N21/47202;;H04N21/47;;H04N21/2343;;H04N21/472;;H04N5/445;;H04N21/2353;;H04N21/4828;;H04N21/2225;;G06F3/00;;H04N7/17318;;H04N7/17336;;H04N21/2143;;H04N21/23113;;H04N21/2318;;H04N21/2543;;H04N21/25435;;H04N21/262;;H04N21/4335;;H04N21/47208;;H04N21/47214;;H04N21/482;;H04N21/4821;;H04N21/6175;;H04N21/643;;H04N21/6581;;H04N21/6587;;H04N21/812;;H04N21/8586;;H04N21/47;;H04N21/2747;;H04N21/4334;;H04N21/47202;;H04N5/91;;H04N21/274;;H04N21/47217;;H04N21/26283;;H04N21/2335;;H04N21/23439;;H04N21/64322;;H04N21/2387;;H04N21/233,H04H60/72;;H04N5/76;;H04N5/445;;H04N21/2343;;H04N5/765;;H04N7/025;;H04N7/03;;H04N7/035;;H04N7/173;;H04N21/214;;H04N21/231;;H04N21/2318;;H04N21/2543;;H04N21/262;;H04N21/2747;;H04N21/433;;H04N21/4335;;H04N21/472;;H04N21/475;;H04N21/482;;H04N21/61;;H04N21/643;;H04N21/658;;H04N21/6587;;H04N21/81;;H04N21/858,386/297;;X386E05003,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Raw brine produced at an operating brine wellhead is injected into a depleted salt cavern along with the treatment chemicals required to purify the raw brine. A novel installation including a producing well or wells, a depleted well cavern or caverns, and support facilities for producing primary treated brine is provided. Also, special wellhead injection tubing, a mixer and radial distributor for injecting the fluids into the cavern are employed which allows for the chemical reaction, precipitation, settling and clarification operations to take place in a pre-selected reaction zone in the cavern. The cavern acts as the reactor for precipitation, settler and clarifier and deposition site for storage of the precipitates which are innocuous solid by-products of the purification process.

Thomson, A. T. M., and Ellis, G. O. Feb. 10. Signals, electric; indicators or annunciators.- Currents transmitted in a number of successive impulses, as in signalling, are caused to pass through several different lines one or more at a time, by means of a multiple-contact switch. with a rotatable arm actuated by a spring or weight released, coincidently with each impulse of current, by an elect o-magnetic escapement. In addition, one or more of the lines contain automaticallyactuated interrupters by which each impulse is broken up into several. Fig. I shows diagrammatically one arrangement of the system. Each current impulse sent from a battery 15 by means of a key or other transmitting-device effects a to-and-fro movement of an electro-magnetic escapement 1, releasing an arbor 33 of a spring-driven train of wheels, not shown, to which a rotatable brush arm 12 of a multiple-contact switch 2 is so connected as to make one-sixth of a revolution at each release. One of the brushes 14 thus moves from one of the segments 7 to the next, and the following current impulse will pass through the next in order of the lines 16; 22, &c. Interrupters 20, 24, &c., consisting of conducting-barrels with projecting teeth adapted to meet spring contacts connected to the lines 16, 22, &c., are geared to the driving-mechanism to make one complete revolution for each release of the escapement 1. Double or multiple brush arms may be used, distributing each current impulse between several different lines. Fig. III. shows the invention applied in telephony to showing indicator numerals by means of revolving drums 40, 41, 42, each of which is actuated by an electro-magnetic escapement in the corresponding line from the multiple - contact switch. The brush arm 12 is actuated as before by an electro-magnetic escapement 1 and key. Another escapement 51, provided with its own key, in a branch line from the battery actuates an interrupter 52 in the common return of the lines 54, 55, &c., by means of which any chosen number of impulses can be sent through whichever of the escapements 43, 44, 45 is in circuit, and the respective drums set to selected numbers. The last contact segment 10 takes the current to lamps 48 which illuminate the numbers. Other indicating or advertising devices may be similarly actuated.

Variable-pitch propellers. ROTOL, Ltd. June 5, 1953 [May 8, 1952], No. 11670/52. Class 114. In a hydraulically operated variable pitch propeller in which liquid is supplied through a coarse pitch conduit 47, 95 to a pitch change motor to increase the pitch of the blades, a normally open lock valve 52 in the conduit is closed in response to the attainment of a propeller speed in excess of a predetermined value, the valve being adapted so that after it has been closed it remains closed when there is an excess of pressure on the pitch change motor side (95) of the valve above that on the other side (47), and a non-return valve 53 is provided in a conduit bypassing the lock valve and arranged to be closed when the pressure on the pitch change motor side (95) exceeds that on the other side (47). The valve 52 is tubular and closes an orifice 51 under the control of fly-weights 62, the opposite end is of large diameter and slides in a cylinder 59 so that when the valve closes it is held closed by the pressure acting on that end. The non- return valve is mounted in the end of the cylinder 59. The propeller is reversible and is provided with a fine pitch stop and a super-fine pitch stop or in a modification is non-reversible and is provided with a fine pitch stop. Liquid to feather the blades is supplied by a conduit 48 and passes to the motor via a duct 87. Increased pressure to release the fine pitch stop and put the blades into super-fine pitch opens a valve 45 and allows liquid to pass to the stop release device. Still higher pressure passes through the valve 45 to release the super-fine pitch stop when the propeller is to be reversed. To prevent the valve 52 closing during momentary over speeding while the blades are passing to super-fine or reverse pitch, an overriding device is provided to hold the valve 52 open. This device comprises a cylinder supplied with liquid through a valve 69, arranged to open at a predetermined pressure, containing a piston 49 which moves out to contact a rod 66 secured to the valve 52. In a modification the piston carries a rod which contacts the valve 52 and the under side of the piston is vented to the other side (47) of the valve 52. Specification 672,953, [Group XXXII], is referred to. Reference has been directed by the Comptroller to Specification 691,755.",ROTOL LTD,GODDEN THOMAS EDWARD;;DANVERS ELLIS;;MORRIS EDWARD HOLLINGWORTH,,https://lens.org/021-883-612-477-787,Granted Patent,no,0,3,1,1,0,B64C11/42,B64C11/42,F1V VDBB          VDBB;;F1V V100          VDBB;;F1V V600          VDBB;;F1V V616          VDBB;;F1V V630          VDBB;;F1V V640          VDBB,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The link system STL provides amplification and is multiplexed to serve a number of connections simultaneously. The exchange is a p.b.x. and the A-stage gives access to satellite exchange links SL, tie lines TL, and exchange lines EL; each of these circuits having two appearances in the A-stage to permit use of a call-transfer facility FA. An operator's position MB has an appearance in the A-stage and also has access to that stage over a stage E. A register RG is accessible over stage D. To convert between multi-frequency keyset signals and other forms of signalling stores S are provided over non-t.d.m. switches L and M.
