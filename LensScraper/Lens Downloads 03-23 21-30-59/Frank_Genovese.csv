Three layers of thin paint-like material is uniformly deposited upon the substrate. The first and third layers are an electrically resistive material, the second layer is a dielectric material. An air gap, descending through all three layers, runs the width of the device. Thus, in operation, energizing the resistive layers in varying configurations of potentials will strike a gaseous plasma in a narrow gap thus ionizing air molecules. In the preferred arrangement, a high potential is applied to the first or innermost resistive layer to strike a plasma and generate ions. A fraction of these ions flow outwardly through the gap past the third or outer resistive layer and may be accelerated to the charging charge retentive surface. By specifying the third or outer layer's potential, the flow of ions to the charge retentive surface is regulated (acting like a control grid) such that ion flow will proceed only until the charge retentive surface potential reaches equality with that applied to the third or outer layer. Further charging ceases and the charge retentive surface is left with a uniform potential equal to that applied to the third or outer layer.

SOLUTION: A luminous flux coming out from the output end of an optical fiber 102 is turned to a high-speed photodetector 170. The photodetector 170 converts an incident luminous flux to a photoelectric current and the photoelectric current is amplified by an amplifier 172 and buffered.

The scanning start detection circuit 176 responds to the output waveform of the amplifier 172. Since the input end 166 of the optical fiber 102 is considerably larger than a scanning spot, the width of an output voltage waveform from the amplifier 172 plotted relating to time is considerably wide.
