A series of configuration parameters held in the scan data file are analyzed for inconsistencies and a select set of parameters are reviewed for codes and industry accepted standards compliance with recorded scan data. Additional qualitative tests may be implemented on the scan test file and unacceptable results may also provide guidance to the weld inspector as to whether continued review of the scan data file is worthwhile.

The system reads ultrasonic testing data from an NDT scan of a series of metal welds and creates a table of target weld indications ranked by a series of filters representative of predetermined exclusion and significance criteria. The invention acts as a weld analysis concentrator by focusing the attention of an inspector on potential weld flaws that merit their attention, thereby increasing the efficiency of the inspector. The process typically reduces 95% to 98% of the ultrasonic weld testing data that must be reviewed by the inspector, while retaining flaw indications necessary for an inspector's competent review in conformity with various code requirements and regulations.",VERIPHASE INC,DAVIS JOHN MARK;;COBBS ARCHIBALD LEACH;;HANSEN CHARLES ALLAN;;DAVIS SAMUEL MATTHEW,,https://lens.org/163-154-693-867-523,Patent Application,no,0,1,2,2,0,G01N29/4445;;G01N29/043;;G01N29/069;;G01N2291/2675,G01S15/88,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The method receives weld scan data in the form of scanning slices and determines if any of the encountered indications match a predetermined criterion. The process utilizes a moving scan data window of scan slices and processes each window for indications of weld defects.

Weld scan section data is accessed and each scan section along the weld seam is processed to find the amount of penetration as a percentage of the thickness of the rib leg metal at the weld location. The amount of penetration is calculated by finding ultrasonic reflections recorded as voxels that have the greatest magnitude within an area of contiguous magnitudes and then determining the location of those voxels relative to the weld geometry and distance along the thickness of the rib leg steel. A report for each section scan and the entire weld seam may be generated for review by a weld inspector that allows for spot inspections of specified areas along the weld seam for possible weld remediation.,VERIPHASE INC,DAVIS JOHN MARK;;COBBS ARCHIBALD LEACH;;HANSEN CHARLES ALLAN;;BUBLITZ NICHOLAS JAMES;;DAVIS SAMUEL MATTHEW,,https://lens.org/010-348-539-901-508,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,3,0,G01N29/06;;G01N29/043;;G01N29/265;;G01N29/262;;G01N2291/106,G01N29/04,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
