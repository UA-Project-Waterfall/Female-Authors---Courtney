HUMPHREYS & GLASGOW Ltd. 1 Nov., 1967 [11 Nov., 1966], No. 50729/66. Heading C2C. A process for the manufacture of urea comprises reacting ammonia with carbon dioxide at elevated temperature and under elevated pressure, removing ammonia, carbon dioxide and ammonium carbamate from the reaction product by passing therethrough while under pressure and with heating a stream of gas comprising at least a mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide produced by reforming and/or oxidizing a fuel, carbon monoxide in the reformed and/or oxidized fuel having been converted to carbon dioxide by reaction with steam, and thereafter removing oxides of carbon from the remaining gas mixture and synthesizing ammonia therefrom. The stream of gas which is passed through the product of the reaction of ammonia and carbon dioxide may also contain nitrogen and the passage of the gas stream through the reaction product is suitably carried out without substantial reduction of the pressure of the latter, e.g. at 130- 200‹ C. and a pressure of 150-400 atmospheres. The removal of the oxides of carbon from the gas stream after passage through said reaction product may be effected by contacting the gas stream with water or a solution of ammonium carbamate. The fuel from which the gas stream may be obtained may be a liquid or gaseous hydrocarbon or a solid fuel, e.g. coke, and a suitable form of apparatus for carrying out the process is described.",HUMPHREYS & GLASGOW LTD,GOODMAN MICHAEL CHARLES,,https://lens.org/005-738-538-950-28X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,4,0,C07C273/10;;C01B3/025;;C01B3/38,C01B3/02;;C01B3/38;;C07C273/10,C2C CKC;;C2C C20Y;;C2C C30Y;;C2C C34Y;;C2C C341;;C2C C41X;;C2C C411;;C2C C413;;C2C C415;;C2C C416;;C2C C481;;C2C C578;;C2C C626,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In the sensor there are circuits that amplify the electrical signal and transmit it with a current loop transmission system over a twisted pair of wires to a central control and analysis computer (30). The amplification of the signal at the sensor is controlled by a signal from the central computer which changes the gain increments until the sensor circuits are not saturated by the ultrasonic signal.

[Also in Division B8] A film, usable for shrink packaging, is formed from an orientated laminate of a vinyl chloride polymer or copolymer and an ethylene polymer or copolymer. The laminates may be prepared by bonding together pre-formed films with an adhesive or by extruding a coating of the ethylene polymer on to a preformed film of the vinyl chloride polymer. Alternatively, a tubular laminate may be produced by extruding two or three layers through concentric tubes. The laminate may be orientated in the longitudinal direction by passing through heated rolls, running at different speeds, and transverse orientation is effected through sets of clamps moving in divergent paths, which grip opposed edges of the laminate. The tubular laminate is orientated by inflation with air. In one example a P.V.C. film is treated with a corona discharge before the application of a coating of polyethylene.

When the additional function k ey and an alphanumeric key are activated in combination, a second interrupt different from the IRQ1 interrupt is activated ( e.g., IRQ15 (222)). The computer system (100) responds to the second interrupt by inputting an identification of the activated alphanumeric key and performing a selected predetermined function in response thereto. The handling of the second interrup t is performed by a separate interrupt handling routine within the computer system (100) so that conventional terminate and stay residen t (TSR) programs that intercept conventional keyboard inputs cannot readily intercept keyboard input initiated by the additio nal function key.",AST RESEARCH INC,RAASCH CHARLES F;;GOODMAN MICHAEL K,,https://lens.org/085-777-849-707-467,Granted Patent,no,0,0,10,10,0,G06F3/0489;;G06F13/24;;G06F13/24;;G06F3/0489,G06F3/023;;G06F3/048;;G06F13/24,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A minor proportion of the diamine may be replaced by another diamine, e.g. bis-(4-aminophenyl)-sulphone. Dicarboxylic acids specified include: a 2-, 4- or 5-alkoxyisophthalic acid, e.g. 4-methoxyisophthalic acid, bis-(4-carboxyphenyl)-ether, 1,2-bis-(4-carboxyphenoxy)-ethane, 2 - methoxy - isophthalic acid, methoxyterephthalic acid, n-propoxyterephthalic acid, and p-bis(4-carboxyphenoxy)-benzene. A minor proportion of the acid may be replaced by another dicarboxylic acid, e.g. isophthalic acid. The reactants may be polymerized in bulk or interfacially. However, preferably the diamine or a salt thereof is reacted with the dihalide of the dicarboxylic acid in an organic solvent for both reactants at about - 20‹ C. and under a nitrogen atmosphere. A surface-active agent and a base may be present. Solvents specified include 2,4-dimethyl cyclic tetramethylene sulphone, methyl ethyl ketone, acetonitrile, cyclic tetramethylene sulphone, hexamethyl phosphoramide, tetramethyl urea, N,N-dialkyl aliphatic carboamides having at least 2 carbon atoms, e.g. N,N-dimethyl acetamide, propionitrile and polyhalogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. CH 2 Cl.

The stopping of the flow of air may be time-based, e.g., based on the start/end times of the hydration cycle, or may be based on moisture level, e.g., as measured by an optical sensor.",HAIER US APPLIANCE SOLUTIONS INC,HUNTER MATTHEW;;SCHROEDER MICHAEL GOODMAN;;JUNGE BRENT ALDEN,HAIER US APPLIANCE SOLUTIONS INC (2020-04-16),https://lens.org/053-271-601-210-124,Patent Application,yes,1,0,7,7,0,A01G9/246;;A01G9/247;;Y02A40/25;;Y02P60/21;;A01G9/00;;A01G9/246;;A01G27/001;;A01G27/003;;A01G27/006;;A01G9/027;;A01G9/26;;A01G9/021;;A01G9/023;;A01G9/247,A01G9/24;;A01G9/26;;A01G27/00,,1,0,,,Machine translation of KR 2121023 B1 (Year: 2019),ACTIVE
