More specifically, a powder may be dispensed from a hopper movable over a volume defined by a powder box to facilitate, for example, rapidly delivering powder in front of a spreader movable across the volume to spread the powder into a layer. The hopper may include a plurality of dispensing rollers along a dispensing region of the hopper. The dispensing rollers may be rotatable relative to one another to control dispensing the powder from the hopper to an area in front of the spreader, reducing wasted motion associated with moving a spreader to retrieve powder from a stationary powder supply and reducing the likelihood of inadvertently delivering powder from the hopper to unintended areas.",DESKTOP METAL INC,MYERBERG JONAH SAMUEL;;FULOP RICARDO;;HOISINGTON PAUL A;;SACHS EMANUEL MICHAEL;;HART ANASTASIOS JOHN;;VAILLANCOURT KEITH;;GARRANT STEVEN;;SCHUSTER BRETT;;HUDELSON GEORGE,DESKTOP METAL INC (2018-05-30),https://lens.org/084-482-875-074-750,Patent Application,yes,0,18,8,8,0,B29C64/165;;B33Y30/00;;B33Y10/00;;Y02P10/25;;B22F12/41;;B22F12/45;;B22F12/47;;B22F10/14;;B22F12/55;;B22F12/52;;B22F10/34;;B22F12/57;;B22F12/224;;B22F12/63;;B33Y40/00;;B22F1/10;;B22F1/14;;B22F3/16;;B22F3/18;;B33Y30/00;;B22F2202/01;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y40/00;;B22F2202/11;;B29C64/165;;B33Y50/02;;B22F10/14;;B22F10/85;;B22F12/63;;B22F12/52;;B22F1/10;;B22F1/14;;B22F12/224;;B22F12/41;;B22F12/45;;B22F12/47;;B22F12/55;;B22F12/57;;B22F10/34;;B22F3/003;;B22F3/004;;B22F2998/00;;B22F2999/00,B22F3/00;;B22F1/10;;B22F1/14;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y30/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

More specifically, a spreader may be moved across a volume defined by a powder box to spread the powder in a layer. As the spreader is moved across the volume, the spreader may vibrate to pack the powder in the volume. By applying this vibration to the powder on a layer-by-layer basis, the resulting three-dimensional object formed through the binder jetting process may have improved density. In turn, such improved density may be useful for forming the three-dimensional objects into finished parts meeting target density standards, which may be particularly useful in the fabrication of metal parts. Further, or instead, applying vibration to the powder may reduce the likelihood of layer-to-layer variations in the three-dimensional object, thus reducing the likelihood of defects in finished parts.",DESKTOP METAL INC,MYERBERG JONAH SAMUEL;;FULOP RICARDO;;HOISINGTON PAUL A;;SACHS EMANUEL MICHAEL;;GIBSON MICHAEL ANDREW;;HART ANASTASIOS JOHN;;VAILLANCOURT KEITH;;GARRANT STEVEN;;SCHUSTER BRETT,DESKTOP METAL INC (2018-05-30),https://lens.org/199-608-164-150-375,Patent Application,yes,0,5,8,8,0,B29C64/165;;B33Y30/00;;B33Y10/00;;Y02P10/25;;B22F12/41;;B22F12/45;;B22F12/47;;B22F10/14;;B22F12/55;;B22F12/52;;B22F10/34;;B22F12/57;;B22F12/224;;B22F12/63;;B33Y40/00;;B22F1/10;;B22F1/14;;B22F3/16;;B22F3/18;;B33Y30/00;;B22F2202/01;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y40/00;;B22F2202/11;;B29C64/165;;B33Y50/02;;B22F10/14;;B22F10/85;;B22F12/63;;B22F12/52;;B22F1/10;;B22F1/14;;B22F12/224;;B22F12/41;;B22F12/45;;B22F12/47;;B22F12/55;;B22F12/57;;B22F10/34;;B22F3/003;;B22F3/004;;B22F2998/00;;B22F2999/00,B22F3/16;;B22F1/10;;B22F1/14;;B22F3/18,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
