The container is charged with the beverage 8 and sealed. Beverage from the main chamber of the container enters the pod 4 (shown at 8a) by way of the aperture 7 to provide headspaces la in the container and 4a in the pod 4. Gas within the headspaces la and 4a is at greater than atmospheric pressure. Preferably the beverage is drawn into the hollow pod by subjecting the package to a heating and cooling cycle. Upon opening the container l by draw ring/region l3, the headspace la is vented to atmosphere and the pressure differential resulting from the pressure in the pod headspace 4a causes gas/beverage to be ejected from the pod (by way of the aperture 7) into the beverage 8. Said ejection causes gas to be evolved from solution in the beverage in the main container chamber to form a head of froth on the beverage.
