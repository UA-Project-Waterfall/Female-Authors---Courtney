The manual finding of electric loading is time consuming and inaccurate. To remedy this problem the textile industry should be implemented using smart grid. So the measurement in many sub areas of the textile industry production was carried out. This was subjected to the k-means of clustering in which the cluster centers and the each cluster distance was measured there by finding the clusters. This is further subjected to Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) which will consider this generated input and the real value both are fed into the discriminator there by producing the output. This led to a high performance in the energy conservation. 1|Page REALISTIC ELECTRIC LOAD PROFILING SYSTEM OF TEXTILE MILLS BY CONSIDERING DYNAMIC AND STOCHASTIC BEHAVIOURS USING GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS (GAN) Drawings Smart Grid K-Means clustering Generator input Random Noise Generator Neural Network Real Data Discriminator Generator Output Image/ Text/Data Neural Network Image/Text/Data Discriminator Output How real the data looks _________ (scaledfr Orealto generated) Updated Discriminatorbased on loss on real and generated data Update Generator based on loss on generated data Figure 1: Overall architecture of the load profile finding system 11 P a g e",ARUNMOZHI S DR;;BABY MARUTHI P DR;;GIRI PRASAD R DR;;GUPTA VARUN DR;;KALVALA RAJENDAR MR;;PAVATE ARUNA ANIMISH MRS;;PUNEETH KUMAR B S DR;;RAMANATHAN L DR;;SUBBARAYUDU CHILUKURI BALA VENKATA PROF;;VIJAY SANKAR U DR,BABY MARUTHI P;;GUPTA VARUN;;GIRI PRASAD R;;VIJAY SANKAR U;;RAMANATHAN L;;PAVATE ARUNA ANIMISH;;ARUNMOZHI S;;PUNEETH KUMAR B S;;SUBBARAYUDU CHILUKURI BALA VENKATA;;KALVALA RAJENDAR,,https://lens.org/033-075-002-548-509,Limited Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,G06Q50/06;;G06F18/23213;;G06N3/094,G06Q50/06;;G06N3/02;;H02J3/12,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE
