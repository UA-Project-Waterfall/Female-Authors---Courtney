   A current-in-the-plane (CIP) giant magnetoresistive (GMR) spin valve sensor has its free layer magnetization stabilized by longitudinal biasing through the use of free layer end-region antiferromagnetic exchange coupling. An antiparallel coupling (APC) layer, such as Ru, is formed on the free layer and a ferromagnetic bias layer is formed on the APC layer. The bias layer is a continuous layer that extends across the entire width of the free layer. The central region of the bias layer is formed of nonmagnetic oxides of one or more of the elements making up the bias layer, with the bias layer end regions remaining ferromagnetic. The oxidized central region of the bias layer defines the central active trackwidth region of the underlying free layer. The ferromagnetic end regions of the bias layer are antiferromagnetically coupled across the APC layer to the corresponding underlying free layer end regions to provide the longitudinal biasing.

In one embodiment, transducers are deposited in a row and column configuration onto a release and support layer covering a wafer substrate having a thickness equal to a desired suspension length. The wafer is separated into a plurality of row sections, with each row section providing one thin film transducer from each column. A second release layer is formed on a separated side on the row section and thin layers of suitable materials are deposited to form a suspension layer including conductive lines extending to the thin film transducers. The first and second release layers are dissolved and the row section is further cut to form the individual combination assemblies. In a second embodiment, the wafer substrate has a thickness equal to the width of the suspension. The transducers deposited on a row are separated by the desired suspension length to produce combination assemblies useful for linear disk drive actuators.
