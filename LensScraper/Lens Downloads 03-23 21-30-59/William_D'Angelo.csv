A bypass valve (120) is mounted on a line to selectively bypass the fluid prior to reaching the heat exchanger. The bypass valve (120) includes a valve poppet (122), a valve seat (124), a piston (134), a valve housing (141) and a wax portion. A piston (134) is moveable along an axis and allows movement of the valve poppet (122) toward and away from the valve seat (124). The piston (134) moves within a valve housing (141). A wax portion expands as a temperature increases, and causes the valve poppet (122) to move against the valve seat (124). The wax portion cools if the temperature lowers such that the valve poppet (122) moves away from the valve seat (124). There is a sealing surface on the valve poppet (122) in sealing contact with the valve seat (124). The sealing surface is part-circular in a plane in which the axis lies. A bypass valve is also disclosed.
