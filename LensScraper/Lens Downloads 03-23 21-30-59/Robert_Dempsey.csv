When the strobe light (8) is operated, the photometric sensor (80) detects light intensity based on transmittance from the strobe light (8). The detected light intensity is correlated with the distance between the sensor (80) and the strobe light (8) to generate a data reading representing an estimate of light intensity emanating from the strobe light (8). Each of these steps is repeated to determine additional data readings representing estimates of light intensity for the same light. The data is then stored in a computer (96) and then processed to determine the average value of light intensity for the strobe light (8).",STROTEK INC,DEMPSEY ROBERT HARRISON,,https://lens.org/012-594-383-247-947,Patent Application,yes,4,0,3,3,0,G01J1/42;;G01J1/42,G01J1/42,,0,0,,,,PENDING

A pair of electrodes are provided on the apparatus which are adapted to make electrical contact with the subject's body at the site of a sting or bite. The apparatus generates a series of pulses which are conveyed to the electrodes. The pulses have a frequency in the range from about 5 Hz to about 50 Hz and a duration in the range from about 50 microseconds to about 50 milliseconds. The intensity of the pulses is controlled and are preferably alternatively positive pulses and negative pulses to reduce problems such as electrode polarization and tissue damage. The frequency, intensity, and duty cycle of the pulses is controlled so that discomfort due to the treatment is minimized. It is preferred that the current pulses delivered to the body be in the range from about 500 microamps to about 10 milliamps.

A pressure switch is placed across a heat exchanger to indicate when, while accelerating the inducer motor speed during purging operation, the pressure drop reaches a predetermined level. When that occurs, the motor speed is sensed and recorded. When the furnace is subsequently fired, the desired inducer motor speed is obtained by modifying the recorded motor speed by a correction factor derived from empirical data obtained from a gas furnace operating under selective variable conditions. Further, in a two stage gas furnace system, low and high pressure switches are placed across the heat exchanger and are successively closed, as the inducer motor accelerates during purging, when the pressure drop reaches the respective theoretically desired low and high firing pressure drop levels. As the switches are closed, the inducer motor speeds are sensed and recorded, with a ratio of the two then being calculated. After firing, the ratio is then directly applied to a desired high firing motor speed to obtain the desired low firing motor speed.",CARRIER CORP,DEMPSEY DANIEL J;;PEITZ ROBERT W JR;;THOMPSON KEVIN D,,https://lens.org/004-659-817-520-627,Granted Patent,no,0,0,9,11,0,F23N1/025;;F23N1/02;;F23N2227/04;;F23N2233/08;;F23N2233/10,F23N1/02,D33410034    M,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   Method and apparatus are provided for treating (e.g., recycling) polystyrene foam scrap particulate in a manner which increases the density of the polystyrene while minimizing an amount of heat required to convert the polystyrene into densified solid polystyrene plastic (e.g., polystyrene flakes), thereby avoiding noticeable polymer degradation. The invention involves first heating polystyrene particulates to a semi-molten state in a heating zone so that polystyrene particulates coalesce. Pressure is then applied in a pressure zone to the polystyrene while the polystyrene is coalescing. The pressure is applied by a pressure mechanism which crushes the heated and softened polystyrene, and which preferably maintains the pressure on the polystyrene until the polystyrene cools below the softening temperature of the polystyrene. The pressure mechanism squeezes essentially all gases (entrained air and expansion gases) from the polystyrene, and thus precludes, e.g., the rebounding of the polystyrene to a pre-crushed density. The retention of sustained pressure by the pressure mechanism obviates utilization of a degree of heat which would melt the polystyrene to its completely liquid (molten) state. The sustained crushing and cooling of the polystyrene by the pressure mechanism enhances the bulk density of the polystyrene, producing polystyrene chips or flakes having an average thickness in a range of about 0.010 inch to about 0.035 inch. The heater and the pressure mechanism which comprise the apparatus of disclosed techniques and apparatus facilitate treating the polystyrene to obtain an enhanced bulk density throughput index in excess of 500, advantageously enhancing density even when polystyrene of a low input density is utilized.

    An artificial lift assembly is suspended from a string of conduit in a well inside a well casing. An encapsulation module is independently suspended from the conduit and encases the pump assembly with a jacket. A series of well fluid conditioning tools are mounted to the lower end of the jacket, including a tubular screen, a desander located behind the screen, a string of disposal conduit extending below the desander, and a nucleation device located above the desander. The entire weight of this fluid conditioning equipment is completely supported by the jacket and the conduit. The encapsulation module is completely sealed so that the well bore fluid is limited to entering the module and pump through the screen. The screen removes larger contaminants from the fluid such as rubber and trash. After the fluid passes through the screen, it enters the desander where solid matter such as sediment is removed from the fluid and eliminated through the disposal conduit. Finally, the fluid enters the nucleation device where its scale is decomposed. After these three clarifying phases, the fluid enters the pump assembly and is pumped to the surface.

    The source code for a computer program contains a plurality of debug output statements that provide a debug output string when the computer program is running. Each debug output statement comprises a fixed-content text string field which is provided in the debug output string. The fixed-content text string field of each debug output statement is replaced with a unique text string number to provide stripped source code. A number-to-string mapping table for translating each unique text string number into a corresponding fixed-content text string is constructed. The stripped source code is compiled to provide stripped object code. 

    The stripped object code for the computer program is run on a target computer. A debug computer receives debug output strings from corresponding debug output statements of the computer program, each debug output string having a unique text string number. The debug computer translates the unique text string number for each debug output string into a corresponding text string using the number-to-string mapping table, and replaces the unique text string number in the debug output string with the corresponding text string to provide an un-stripped debug output string. The debug computer displays the un-stripped debug output string.
