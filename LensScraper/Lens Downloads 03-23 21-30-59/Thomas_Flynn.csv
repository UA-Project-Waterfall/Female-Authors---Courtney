The configuring of the arrangement defines how each unit of data is processed by the encoding elements and creates an arrangement corresponding to a frame size that is dependent upon the number of units of data in the series, for example so that the frame size of the arrangement is guaranteed to be greater than the number of units of data in the series.",FLYNN THOMAS MALCOLM,FLYNN THOMAS MALCOLM,,https://lens.org/046-737-909-245-938,Patent Application,yes,4,0,7,7,0,H04L2209/20;;H04L9/16;;H04L9/06;;H04L9/16;;H04L9/50;;H04L2209/20;;H04L9/16;;H04L63/0485;;H04L9/14;;H04L63/0428;;H04L63/18;;H04L2209/34;;H04L2463/041,H04L9/06;;H04L9/16,,0,0,,,,PENDING

    In a virtual machine (VM) environment, a virtual machine ID (VMID) uniquely associated with a preferred virtual guest (  222  ) is sent to a storage controller (  108  ) along with requests to RESERVE or RELEASE a direct access storage device (DASD) (  128  ). The VMID is used by the storage controller (  108  ) along with a path group ID (PGID) to determine the scope of the RESERVE or RELEASE. Thus, preferred virtual guests (  216  ) of a single host processor (  112  ) may share the DASD while both preserving data integrity and operating with the performance benefits of Input/Output (I/O) Assist. Sharing is similarly provided for tape devices with requests to ASSIGN or UNASSIGN.

The improved cryogenic propellant is illustrated by a mixture of liquid hydrogen and solid methane. As an example, an approximate 50/50 mixture by weight of liquid hydrogen and solid methane has a mixture density approximately 2.0 times that of liquid hydrogen alone. This increase in density is partially offset by a loss in ISP of about 8 percent, compared to that of liquid hydrogen alone, with oxygen. Broadly speaking, more of the improved fuel must be carried for a given mission to compensate for the loss in ISP. However, this weight penalty is offset by the 200 percent increase in density.

   The inventions describes a method and apparatus for remotely forming a mixture of liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid methane (LNG), with the mixture commonly referred to as MOX, such that the LOX and LNG never contact each other until inside the container in which the mixture will be used. The method disallows contact between the LOX and the LNG in order to prevent the premature or inadvertent explosive combustion that can occur in a variety of ways. The method provides a way to deactivate the MOX mixture, even after the MOX mixture has been formed. The invention also contemplates various apparatuses that will allow the method to be practiced.

Punches d, actuated by hydraulic pistons c, serve to operate in conjunction with dies e to cut the tesserµ, separate punches being used to cut the different coloured tesserµ. The punches push the tesserµ through the dies on to a fabric backing. The die is then lifted by a hydraulic device g, and afterwards the punch is lifted. The fabric is then fed as described in the above-mentioned Specification, to the next punch, where tesserµ of another colour will be cut and deposited in position. When in this manner the pattern is filled up, the fabric and tesserµ pass into a hydraulic press, where they are compressed.

    A system and method for quickly improving the accuracy of a speech recognition program. The system is based on a speech recognition program that automatically converts a pre-recorded audio file into a written text. The system parses the written text into segments, each of which is corrected by the system and saved in an individually retrievable manner in association with the computer. The standard speech files are saved towards improving accuracy in speech-to-text conversion by the speech recognition program. The system further includes facilities to repetitively establish an independent instance of the written text from the prerecorded audio file using the speech recognition program. This independent instance can then be broken into segments and each segment in said independent instance replaced with an individually retrievable saved corrected segment associated with that segment. In this manner, repetitive instruction of a speech recognition program can be facilitated.

SOLUTION: When thread changeover is performed, control logic 6 changes the state of thread changeover signals from a low level to a high level during one clock cycle. As a result, an output multiplexer 16 outputs the instructions stored in the thread changeover instruction queue 14. Since the thread changeover instruction queue 14 stores many instructions, the instructions not dispatched to plural processing pipelines are received by an instruction filling multiplexer 12. The instruction filling multiplexer 12 outputs instruction output outputted from the output multiplexer 16 to the main instruction queue 10 corresponding to the state change of the thread changeover signals. In such a manner, in a single clock cycle, the instruction from the suspension thread to be turned to an active thread is dispatched to the processing pipeline and transferred to the main instruction queue 10.",IBM,WILLIAM THOMAS FLYNN;;PHILIP ROGERS HILLIER III,,https://lens.org/071-784-298-340-482,Patent Application,no,0,4,13,13,0,G06F9/3802;;G06F9/3814;;G06F9/3851;;G06F9/461;;G06F9/46;;G06F9/3814;;G06F9/461;;G06F9/3851;;G06F9/3802,G06F9/38;;G06F9/46,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The system provides a circuitous flow path for the oxygen-carrier particles, which are used to partially oxidize the fuel to produce syngas. The circuitous flow path can proceed through a plurality of unit operations, including a reducer, a conversion reactor, an oxidizer, and a combustor. The conversion reactor is designed to partially oxidize carbonaceous fuel in co-current flow with the oxygen-carrier particles to produce syngas. In embodiments including an oxidizer, the oxidizer is designed to at partially re-oxidize the carrier particles, yielding hydrogen that can be mixed with partially oxidized products from the conversion reactor to adjust syngas quality. The combustor can be used to fully oxidize the carrier particles traveling in a closed loop. Reactions carried out in the combustor are highly exothermic and yield thermal energy that is absorbed by the carrier particles. The absorbed energy is used at other parts of the process, including the conversion reactor, to drive endothermic reactions. In this manner the system can be operated autothermally or nearly so. Methods of producing syngas are also disclosed.",BABCOCK & WILCOX CO,SIENGCHUM TRITTI;;VELAZQUEZ-VARGAS LUIS;;FLYNN THOMAS;;DEVAULT DOUGLAS,,https://lens.org/072-597-809-323-127,Patent Application,no,0,0,17,17,0,Y02E60/36;;C01B3/061;;C01B3/08;;C01B3/344;;C01B2203/0216;;C01B2203/0811;;C01B2203/1241;;C01B2203/0222;;C01B2203/0255;;C01B3/36;;C01B2203/0838;;C01B3/36;;C01B2203/0838;;C10J3/725;;Y02E60/36;;C01B3/061;;C01B3/08;;C01B3/344;;C01B2203/0216;;C01B2203/0811;;C01B2203/1241;;C01B2203/0222;;C01B2203/0255,C10G2/00;;C10J3/72,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

If the raw data is chaotic in nature, a Lyapunov exponent, Kolmogorov entropy or cross section of a chaotic attractor can be utilized as a measure of the quality of the flame and further used to control one or more parameters of the burner to adjust the flame.",BABCOCK & WILCOX CO,JEFFERS LARRY A;;FULLER TIMOTHY A;;FLYNN THOMAS J,BABCOCK & WILCOX COMPANY THE (1993-08-19);;MCDERMOTT TECHNOLOGY INC (1997-06-30),https://lens.org/082-224-509-804-990,Granted Patent,yes,2,25,1,1,0,G01J5/0014;;G01J5/0014,G01J5/00,364/498;;364/496;;431/14,13,5,087-680-343-588-79X;;099-484-804-669-742;;057-397-597-672-551;;138-558-100-250-347;;013-828-932-041-980,10.1016/0167-2789(86)90031-x;;10.1103/physreva.28.2591;;10.1103/physreva.33.1134;;9896728;;10.1038/scientificamerican0893-78;;9905344;;10.1103/physreva.43.2787,"Gorman et al., Real Time Identification of Flame Dynamics Applied Chaos, 1992 pp. 261 276.;;Stringer, J; Is Fluidized Bed a Chaotic Dynamic System , Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Fluidized Bed Combustion, San Francisco, Calif., Apr. 30 May 3, vol. 1, pp. 265 272, 1989.;;Daw, C.

The system provides a circuitous flow path for the oxygen-carrier particles, which are used to partially oxidize the fuel to produce syngas. The circuitous flow path can proceed through a plurality of unit operations, including a reducer, a conversion reactor, an oxidizer, and a combustor. The conversion reactor is designed to partially oxidize carbonaceous fuel in co-current flow with the oxygen-carrier particles to produce syngas. In embodiments including an oxidizer, the oxidizer is designed to at partially re-oxidize the carrier particles, yielding hydrogen that can be mixed with partially oxidized products from the conversion reactor to adjust syngas quality. The combustor can be used to fully oxidize the carrier particles traveling in a closed loop.

    An Internet Protocol (IP) voice telephony system constructed according to the present invention manages Gatekeeper load by redirecting calls from an assigned Gatekeeper to a servicing Gatekeeper during call setup. A Load Management Unit (LMU) processes all setup messages. In processing the setup messages, the LMU receives the message from the assigned Gatekeeper to which a requesting endpoint is registered. Upon receipt, the LMU determines which Gatekeeper of a plurality of Gatekeepers should setup and service the call. Based upon its selection, the LMU either directs the assigned Gatekeeper to setup and service the call or redirects the endpoint to a servicing Gatekeeper. Upon receipt of a redirection message, the endpoint sends a confirmation message to the assigned Gateway and then sends a setup message to the servicing Gateway. Upon receipt of the setup message, the servicing Gateway sets up and services the call. In selecting the servicing Gateway, the LMU may consider loading on each Gateway, availability of each Gateway (e.g., are any Gateways out of service), and load distribution among a plurality of Gateways, among other consideration.

The multithreaded processor is capable of switching between two or more threads of instructions which can be independently executed. Each thread has a corresponding state in a thread state register depending on its execution status. The thread switch logic contains a thread switch control register to store the conditions upon which a thread switch will occur. The thread switch logic has a time-out register which forces a thread switch when execution of the active thread in the multithreaded processor exceeds a programmable period of time. Thread switch logic also has a forward progress count register to prevent repetitive unproductive thread switching between threads in the multithreaded processor.

    A system and method for improving the accuracy of a speech recognition program. The system is based on a speech recognition program that automatically converts a pre-recorded audio file into a written text. The system parses the written text into segments, each of which can be corrected by the system and saved in a retrievable manner in association with the computer. The standard speech files are saved towards improving accuracy in speech-to-text conversion by the speech recognition program. The system further includes facilities to repetitively establish an independent instance of the written text from the pre-recorded audio file using the speech recognition program. This independent instance can then be broken into segments and each erroneous segment in said independent instance replaced with the corrected segment associated with that segment. In this manner, repetitive instruction of a speech recognition program can be facilitated.

   A system and method for improving the accuracy of a speech recognition program. The system is based on a speech recognition program that automatically converts a pre-recorded audio file into a written text. The system parses the written text into segments, each of which can be corrected by the system and saved in a retrievable manner in association with the computer. The standard speech files are saved towards improving accuracy in speech-to-text conversion by the speech recognition program. The system further includes facilities to repetitively establish an independent instance of the written text from the pre-recorded audio file using the speech recognition program. This independent instance can then be broken into segments and each erroneous segment in said independent instance replaced with the corrected segment associated with that segment. In this manner, repetitive instruction of a speech recognition program can be facilitated.

The system generates a uniquely identified voice dictation file from a current voice user and - based on the training status the system - routes the uniquely identified voice dictation file to a manual transcription station and the speech recognition program. A human transcriptionist creates transcribed files for each received voice dictation file. The speech recognition program automatically creates a written text for each received voice dictation file if the training status of the current user is training or automated. A verbatim file is manually established if the training status of the current user is enrollment or training and the speech recognition program is trained with an acoustic model for the current user using the verbatim file and the voice dictation file if the training status of the current user is enrollment or training. The transcribed file is returned to the current user if the training status of the current user is enrollment or training or the written text is returned if the training status of the current user is automated.

The automation eliminates manual CLI command entry and provides support for independently-developed multi-vendor equipment by using multiple CLI command vocabularies and CLI command dictionaries associated therewith. The solution reduces communications network entity management costs, downtime, and training time for analysts.

   The solution provides automated Command Line Interface (CLI) based configuration management of managed communications network entities. The automation eliminates manual CLI command entry and provides support for independently-developed multi-vendor equipment by using multiple CLI command vocabularies and CLI command dictionaries associated therewith. The solution reduces communications network entity management costs, downtime, and training time for analysts. The advantages are derived from a generic design of software applications and a manageable object type derivation hierarchy, reducing operational over heads by shielding thereof from updates to the CLI command grammar and/or vocabulary.

   The present invention comprises a method and apparatus for automatic discovery of logical links between network devices. In one embodiment, the present invention comprises part of a network management system (NM) that manages a discrete set of network devices. The NM sends SNMP queries to individual network devices managed by the NM to obtain interface configuration data for each of the network interfaces of the device. The information requested includes destination information (next hop or neighbor IP address) for data packets sent from the interface. The NM checks to see whether a logical link corresponding to the received configuration information already exists in a logical link database maintained by the NM. If such a link exists the NM checks to see if the existing information for the link is valid. If the existing link data is valid, no change is made. If the existing information is not valid, or if no corresponding link is found in the link database, the NM creates a new link corresponding to the new configuration information. In one or more embodiments, the NM displays a graphical view of the discovered IP links on a graphical network map.

The multithreaded processor is capable of switching between two or more threads of instructions which can be independently executed. Each thread has a corresponding state in a thread state register depending on its execution status. The thread switch logic contains a thread switch control register to store the conditions upon which a thread will occur. The thread switch logic has a time-out register which forces a thread switch when execution of the active thread in the multithreaded processor exceeds a programmable period of time. Thread switch logic also has a forward progress count register to prevent repetitive thread switching between threads in the multithreaded processor.

The IP telephony system includes a plurality of Gatekeepers, each of which may include a Registration Load Management Unit (RLMU). A RLMU may also be resident upon one or more Domain Name Servers (DNSs) servicing the IP network(s) over which the IP telephony system operates. In a first embodiment a plurality of Gatekeepers are organized without a hierarchy structure. In such case, the plurality of Gatekeepers are made up of a plurality of Gatekeeper service nodes and a plurality of Gatekeeper Database nodes. The Gatekeeper service nodes provide the Registration, Admission, Status, Location, Call Set Up and other operating functions of the Gatekeeper while the plurality of Gatekeeper Database nodes store subscriber information. Each of the Gatekeeper service nodes has access to each of the plurality of Gatekeeper Database nodes. Subscriber load is assigned to the plurality of Gatekeeper service nodes by the RLMU located in the DNS. In a second embodiment, a plurality of Gatekeepers are organized in a hierarchy structure with a Root Gatekeeper at the top of the hierarchy and a plurality of Gatekeepers residing below the Root Gatekeeper in single or multiple levels of hierarchy. All Registration requests are directed to the Root Gatekeeper. Upon receipt of a Registration request, a RLMU in the Root Gatekeeper selects one of the Gatekeepers it manages to service the subscriber. Each of the plurality of Gatekeepers provides both operating and database functions. Thus, each of the Gatekeepers stores its own registration data.

The system provides a circuitous flow path for the oxygen-carrier particles, which are used to partially oxidize the fuel to produce syngas. The circuitous flow path can proceed through a plurality of unit operations, including a reducer, a conversion reactor, an oxidizer, and a combustor. The conversion reactor is designed to partially oxidize carbonaceous fuel in co-current flow with the oxygen-carrier particles to produce syngas. In embodiments including an oxidizer, the oxidizer is designed to at partially re-oxidize the carrier particles, yielding hydrogen that can be mixed with partially oxidized products from the conversion reactor to adjust syngas quality. The combustor can be used to fully oxidize the carrier particles traveling in a closed loop. Reactions carried out in the combustor are highly exothermic and yield thermal energy that is absorbed by the carrier particles. The absorbed energy is used at other parts of the process, including the conversion reactor, to drive endothermic reactions. In this manner the system can be operated autothermally or nearly so.

The multithreaded processor is capable of switching between two or more threads of instructions which can be independently executed. Each thread has a corresponding state in a thread state register (440) depending on its execution status. The thread switch logic contains a thread switch control register (410) to store the conditions upon which a thread will occur. The thread switch logic has a time-out register (430) which forces a thread switch when execution of the active thread in the multithreaded processor exceeds a programmable period of time. Thread switch logic also has a forward progress count register (420) to prevent repetitive thread switching between threads in the multithreaded processor.

The system provides a circuitous flow path for the oxygen-carrier particles, which are used to partially oxidize the fuel to produce syngas. The circuitous flow path can proceed through a plurality of unit operations, including a reducer, a conversion reactor, an oxidizer, and a combustor. The conversion reactor is designed to partially oxidize carbonaceous fuel in co-current flow with the oxygen-carrier particles to produce syngas. In embodiments including an oxidizer, the oxidizer is designed to at partially re-oxidize the carrier particles, yielding hydrogen that can be mixed with partially oxidized products from the conversion reactor to adjust syngas quality. The combustor can be used to fully oxidize the carrier particles traveling in a closed loop. Reactions carried out in the combustor are highly exothermic and yield thermal energy that is absorbed by the carrier particles. The absorbed energy is used at other parts of the process, including the conversion reactor, to drive endothermic reactions. In this manner the system can be operated autothermally or nearly so.

The Gatekeeper service nodes provide the Registration, Admission, Status, Location, Call Set Up and other operating functions of the Gatekeeper while the plurality of Gatekeeper Database nodes store subscriber information. Each of the Gatekeeper service nodes has access to each of the plurality of Gatekeeper Database nodes. Subscriber load is assigned to the plurality of Gatekeeper service nodes by the RLMU located in the DNS. In a second embodiment, a plurality of Gatekeepers are organized in a hierarchy structure with a Root Gatekeeper at the top of the hierarchy and a plurality of Gatekeepers residing below the Root Gatekeeper in single or multiple levels of hierarchy. All Registration requests are directed to the Root Gatekeeper. Upon receipt of a Registration request, a RLMU in the Root Gatekeeper selects one of the Gatekeepers it manages to service the subscriber. Each of the plurality of Gatekeepers provides both operating and database functions. Thus, each of the Gatekeepers stores its own registration data.

The system provides a circuitous flow path for the oxygen-carrier particles, which are used to partially oxidize the fuel to produce syngas. The circuitous flow path can proceed through a plurality of unit operations, including a reducer, a conversion reactor, an oxidizer, and a combustor. The conversion reactor is designed to partially oxidize carbonaceous fuel in co-current flow with the oxygen-carrier particles to produce syngas. In embodiments including an oxidizer, the oxidizer is designed to at partially re-oxidize the carrier particles, yielding hydrogen that can be mixed with partially oxidized products from the conversion reactor to adjust syngas quality. The combustor can be used to fully oxidize the carrier particles traveling in a closed loop. Reactions carried out in the combustor are highly exothermic and yield thermal energy that is absorbed by the carrier particles. The absorbed energy is used at other parts of the process, including the conversion reactor, to drive endothermic reactions. In this manner the system can be operated autothermally or nearly so.

The multithreaded processor is capable of switching between two or more threads of instructions which can be independently executed. Each thread has a corresponding state in a thread state register depending on its execution status. The thread switch logic contains a thread switch control register to store the conditions upon which a thread will occur. The thread switch logic has a time-out register which forces a thread switch when execution of the active thread in the multithreaded processor exceeds a programmable period of time. Thread switch logic also has a forward progress count register to prevent repetitive thread switching between threads in the multithreaded processor. Thread switch logic also is responsive to a software manager capable of changing the priority of the different threads and thus superseding thread switch events.,IBM,BORKENHAGEN JOHN MICHAEL;;EICKEMEYER RICHARD JAMES;;FLYNN WILLIAM THOMAS;;WOTTRENG ANDREW HENRY,GOOGLE LLC (2011-09-30);;INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (1997-10-06),https://lens.org/133-485-578-016-318,Granted Patent,yes,59,242,3,3,0,G06F9/3851;;G06F9/4825;;G06F9/4825;;G06F9/3851,G06F9/38;;G06F9/48,712/228;;712/234;;712/23;;712/245;;709/8,78,33,157-059-351-980-531;;124-644-310-673-922;;048-210-714-660-316;;045-705-249-305-639;;117-557-189-086-945;;075-214-566-065-490;;010-621-645-346-012;;025-349-144-902-492;;114-585-629-283-176;;005-771-400-618-190;;005-287-326-608-44X;;179-787-108-994-232;;096-425-611-340-781;;060-285-715-870-551;;006-606-035-851-556;;035-820-560-045-375;;067-815-262-415-846;;123-313-476-522-726;;125-148-719-740-039;;086-645-991-581-326;;091-960-879-410-464;;171-236-019-956-195;;000-851-639-382-843;;006-815-029-077-040;;106-045-254-085-378;;183-496-878-232-60X;;100-915-723-955-427;;135-320-061-097-861;;175-605-678-016-937;;055-805-283-326-805;;009-841-717-035-862;;033-324-799-125-590;;030-552-352-114-372,10.1109/tc.1982.1676014;;10.1147/rd.111.0025;;10.1109/isca.1989.714562;;10.1145/1465482.1465495;;10.1145/1476589.1476703;;10.1093/comjnl/14.1.45;;10.1147/rd.111.0008;;10.1145/1463891.1463965;;10.1109/t-c.1974.223923;;10.1146/annurev.cs.01.060186.001301;;10.1109/tc.1987.5009501;;10.1109/isca.1988.5255;;10.1109/isca.1990.134498;;10.1145/1067651.801684;;10.1109/c-m.1972.216889;;10.1109/mc.1974.6323457;;10.1109/mc.1979.1658578;;10.1145/800046.801661;;10.1145/2465.2467;;10.1109/superc.1988.44631;;10.1007/978-3-642-83248-2_6;;10.1109/superc.1988.44632;;10.1109/pact.1996.552653;;10.1109/eurmic.1996.546468;;10.1145/165123.165149;;10.1007/bf00127847;;10.1109/2.73;;10.1109/mspec.1985.6370784;;10.1109/cmpcon.1988.4912;;10.1109/c-m.1976.218407;;10.1109/real.1989.63587;;10.1109/ipps.1993.262872;;10.1049/ip-cdt:19960788,"IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, vol. 39, No. 08, Aug. 1996, pp 113 116, Entitled Algorithm for Instruction Cache Arbitration Among Multiple Instruction Streams .;;Eickemeyer et al, Evaluation of Multithreaded Uniprocessors for Commercial Application Enviornments , 23rd International Symposium on Computer Architecture, pp. 203 212, May 1996.;;Song P., Multithreading Comes of Age , Microdesign Resources, Microprocessor Report, pp. 13 18, Jul. 14, 1997.;;Dongarra, Jack J., A Survey of High Performance Computers , U.S. Government Work, pp. 8 11 (Jan. 10, 1986).;;Iannucci, Robert A., Two Fundamental Issues in Multiprocessing , Laboratory for Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Proceeding of the DFVLR Conference, pp. 61 88 (Jun. 25 29, 1987).;;Kuck, David J., The Burroughs Scientific Processor (BSP) , IEEE Transactions on Computers, vol.

These novel emulsions have various medical and oxygen transport applications, such as ""artificial blood"" and preserving organs.",MINNESOTA MINING & MFG,KAUFMAN ROBERT J;;RICHARD THOMAS J;;MOORE GEORGE G I;;FLYNN RICHARD M,,https://lens.org/140-910-402-314-029,Granted Patent,no,0,0,16,16,0,A01N1/02;;A01N1/0205;;A01N1/0221;;A61K9/0026;;A61K31/02;;A61K31/08;;A61K49/0002;;A61K49/1806;;C07C43/123;;C07C43/126;;C07C43/313;;A61K9/0026;;C07C43/126;;A61K31/08;;C07C43/123;;A61K31/02;;A01N1/02;;A61K49/1806;;A61K49/0002;;A01N1/0221;;A01N1/0205;;C07C43/313,A61K47/06;;A01N1/02;;A61B5/055;;A61K9/00;;A61K31/02;;A61K31/08;;A61K49/00;;A61K49/18;;A61N5/00;;B01J13/00;;C07C43/12;;C07C43/313,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Each source interconnect chip maintains a spray mask including multiple available links for each destination chip for spraying packets across multiple links of a local rack interconnect system. Each packet is assigned an End-to-End (ETE) sequence number in the source interconnect chip that represents the packet position in an ordered packet stream from the source device. The destination interconnect chip uses the ETE sequence numbers to reorder the received sprayed packets into the correct order before sending the packets to the destination device.",IBM;;IBM UK;;SHEDIVY DAVID ALAN;;HILLIER III PHILIP ROGERS;;VALK KENNETH MICHAEL;;FLYNN WILLIAM THOMAS,SHEDIVY DAVID ALAN;;HILLIER III PHILIP ROGERS;;VALK KENNETH MICHAEL;;FLYNN WILLIAM THOMAS,,https://lens.org/150-054-772-681-874,Patent Application,yes,0,0,11,11,0,G06F13/4022;;G06F2213/0026;;G06F13/4022;;G06F2213/0026;;G06F13/4022;;G06F2213/0026,G06F13/42,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Solids flowing from the BFB enclosure to the CFB reaction chamber may be controlled using one or more non-mechanical valves. Each non-mechanical valve is independently controlled using independently controlled fluidizing means. The non-mechanical valve has collectors to collect solids backsifting into the fluidizing means of the valve. Agglomerates are removed which could block the valve. Channel walls parallel to the direction of solids flow through the valve opening may be provided to reduce external interference with local fluidization to maintain the proper functionality of the non-mechanical valve.",BABCOCK & WILCOX CO,MARYAMCHIK MIKHAIL;;KRAFT DAVID L;;ALEXANDER KIPLIN C;;FLYNN THOMAS J;;HU SHENGTENG,,https://lens.org/014-500-798-947-665,Granted Patent,no,2,0,24,24,0,F23C10/04;;F23C10/10;;F23C10/26;;F23C10/30;;F23C2206/102;;F23C2206/103;;F23C2900/10008;;F22B31/0038;;B01J8/24;;F23C10/26;;F23C10/04;;F22B31/0038;;F23C10/30;;F23C2900/10008;;F23C10/10;;F23C2206/102;;F23C2206/103,B01J8/24,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE
