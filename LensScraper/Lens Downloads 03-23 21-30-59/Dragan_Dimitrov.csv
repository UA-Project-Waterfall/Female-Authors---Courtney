It makes it possible to obtain narrowly distributed microcapsules of small sizes, reducing the duration of the process. This method consists of dispersing a mixture of a film-forming polymer solution in highly volatile solvent with the microincapsulable substance in a dispersion of segregation particles in a non-polar liquid. Dispersion is carried out at a temperature higher than the melting point of the segregation particle material. Subsequent formation of segregated particles occurs following the cooling of the mixture to a temperature lower than the melting temperature of the segregation particle material. This is the result of removing the solvent by passing air or inert gas through the mixture, followed by separation of the micro-capsules from the non-polar liquid and of the segregation particles through filtration, rinsing and drying.",T KOM ZA SINT KHUMANNI I VETER,SOLODOVNIK VALENTIN D;;SOLODKAJA TATJANA I;;DAVIDOV ANATOLIJ B;;UTJAMISHEV RUSTAM I;;BABAJAN EDUARD A;;VASEV BORIS S;;NACHEV DRAGAN S;;NIKOLOV IVAN S;;DIMITROV BOGOMIL A;;KAFEDZHIJSKI STEFAN K,,https://lens.org/090-347-596-667-284,Limited Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,,A61K9/52;;B01J13/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
