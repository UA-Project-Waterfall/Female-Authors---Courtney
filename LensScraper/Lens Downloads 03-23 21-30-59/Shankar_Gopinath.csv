Aspects of the present specification provide an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) (102) operable to convert an analog input signal to an output signal at an output of the ADC. In some examples, an ADC includes a plurality of sub-ADCs (104) coupled in parallel, each of the plurality of sub-ADCs coupled to an output of the ADC and operable to receive an analog input signal. The ADC is configured to operate the sub-ADCs in a continuous operation loop, including a transition phase in which the ADC sequentially operates each sub-ADC in a first number of sequences, and an estimation phase in which the ADC sequentially operates each sub-ADC in a second number of sequences following the first number of sequences, and a randomization phase in which the ADC operates a subset of the sub-ADCs in a third number of sequences following the second number of sequences.",TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INC,RAMAKRISHNAN SHANKAR;;GOPINATH NEERAJ;;NOORANI SAMER A;;MATTHEWS JOHN P;;ALMARAPUR NAGALINGA SWAMY BASAYYA,,https://lens.org/090-322-299-883-297,Patent Application,no,0,0,3,3,0,H03M1/1215;;H03M1/066;;H03M1/0673;;H03M1/0607;;H03M1/124;;H03M1/08;;H03M1/121;;H03M1/1009;;H03M1/0626,H03M1/12;;H03M1/10,,0,0,,,,PENDING
