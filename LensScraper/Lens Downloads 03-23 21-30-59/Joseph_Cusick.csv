A source of pressurized air is delivered though a hose to the welder head, and is directed through heat conductive air tubes within the welder head, is forced through a plurality of coils which surround an area that contains heat energy created during the welding process. As the air moves through the coils, it acquires some of the heat energy within the welder head. The heated air is vented into an outer jacket, which contains the electrically conductive cables, and an airspace surrounding the cables. As the heated air moves toward a rear connector block, it contacts the length of the cables, and is able to transfer some of the heat to the cables. This allows some of the heat energy contained within the pressurized air to be transferred through physical contact to the metal cable, so that as the air moves farther along the length of the metal cable, it will lose more of its heat energy, so that it begins to cool, which will cause the heat acquired by the metal cable to move along the length of the cable in the direction of the cooler air toward the rear connector block, thus maximizing the cooling potential of this forced air system.","CUSICK, III; JOSEPH B.",CUSICK III JOSEPH B,,https://lens.org/126-112-397-876-655,Granted Patent,yes,7,27,1,1,0,B23K9/285;;B23K9/296;;B23K9/285;;B23K9/296,B23K9/28;;B23K9/29,219/137.62;;219/137.63,1,0,,,"DF Machine Specialties Inc.

    An improved welding apparatus, for use with a MIG apparatus, or a tungsten rod in a TIG apparatus. A nozzle housing, having an outer shroud, defines an airspace, which receives an injection of water vapor mist. The water vapor mist, when directed into the airspace in the nozzle housing, contacts the heated nozzle housing surface, and is then able to absorb the heat energy from the nozzle housing surface. When the water vapor mist absorbs heat energy, it undergoes a phase change from atomized water into steam. The steam is allowed to exit out of the rear portion of the rear of the nozzle assembly. 

    The phase change of water to steam provides a significant heat transfer, due to the latent heat energy absorption capability of the water that is required to convert it from a liquid state to a gaseous state. This cooling apparatus, and method of cooling, both utilize a minimal amount of water usage, and also dramatically extends the usable life of the welding apparatus.

    An information retrieval and visualization system utilizes multiple search engines for retrieving documents from a document database based upon user input queries. Search engines include an n-gram search engine and a vector space model search engine using a neural network training algorithm. Each search engine produces a common mathematical representation of each retrieved document. The retrieved documents are then combined and ranked. Mathematical representations for each respective document is mapped onto a display. Information displayed includes a three-dimensional display of keywords from the user input query. The three-dimensional visualization capability based upon the mathematical representation of information within the information retrieval and visualization system provides users with an intuitive understanding, with relevance feedback/query refinement techniques that can be better utilized, resulting in higher retrieval accuracy (precision).
