A solution, saturated or at high concentration, of potassium persulphate and ammonium persulphate in water or in aqueous sulphuric acid, is introduced by an inlet 18 (Fig. 1), to a tube 16 which has a portion 10 cooled by cooling medium in a jacket 12 to initiate crystallization of the salts. Crystals may be removed from surface 10 by means of a scraper. Crystals of both salts form and settle down the tube 16, building up a loose mass of crystals which occupies the full height of tube 16. The solvent, i.e. water or aqueous sulphuric acid, is introduced by an inlet 19 and flows gradually upwards through the mass of crystals establishing a concentration gradient as it dissolves some of the descending salts, particularly ammonium persulphate which is more readily soluble. Crystals are constantly removed from the bottom of the mass through an outlet 21 while fresh crystals are supplied to the top of the loose mass. The crystals are removed by outlet 21 as a slurry, liquid being recirculated by a pump 30, and consist almost entirely of potassium persulphate. A solution of ammonium persulphate containing almost no potassium persulphate is removed by an outlet 11. Instead of introducing a solution of the two salts by inlet 18, the salts may be introduced in crystal form to the medium in tube 16, in which case the cooled portion 10 is not required. The lower end of tube 16 may be heated or cooled by circulating a medium through a jacket to maintain a temperature at which the difference in solubilities of the salts is most pronounced.

A phase shifter in the receiving array also ensures coherent combination of the incoming signal. The angle-detection array and transmitter array are RF-decoupled for full-duplex communication. The efficiency of the system is increased by using an interrogator signal at a much lower frequency than the transmitted signal.

The method also includes determining, based on a first segment of the input audio signal, that the input audio signal comprises speech, and determining a delay between the input audio signal and a corresponding output audio signal provided to a speaker. The method also includes reducing the delay, wherein reducing the delay comprises removing one or more segments of the stored input audio signal to create a time-compressed audio signal and providing the time-compressed audio signal as the corresponding output audio signal.

A phase shifter in the receiving array (B) also ensures coherent combination of the incoming signal. The angle-detection array and transmitter array are RF-decoupled for full-duplex communication. The efficiency of the system is increased by using an interrogator signal at a much lower frequency than the transmitted signal. In a preferred embodiment, a simple two-element angle detecting array detects the direction of the source. Since the source angle is determined by measuring the phase difference between the two antenna elements, the angle detecting array is insensitive to the type of modulation used for the incoming signal.",UNIV HAWAII,SHIROMA GRANT S;;SHIROMA WAYNE A;;MIYAMOTO RYAN Y,,https://lens.org/184-612-819-923-074,Patent Application,yes,0,5,3,3,0,H01Q3/2647;;H01Q3/2647,H01Q1/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The wing is caused to deploy from an initially packed condition and to assume its functional shape by means of an inflation gas. After inflation, the wing is rigidized by any of several means, such that the inflation gas is no longer required. The composite wing is fabricated from a base reinforcement material, often a fabric, which is coated with a polymer resin that hardens when exposed to a curing mechanism. Several activation mechanisms exist by which to initiate rigidization of such a structure, including elevated temperature, ultraviolet light, and chemical constituents of the inflation gas.

The wing is caused to deploy from an initially packed condition and to assume its functional shape by means of an inflation gas. After inflation, the wing is rigidized by any of several means, such that the inflation gas is no longer required. The composite wing is fabricated from a base reinforcement material, often a fabric, which is coated with a polymer resin that hardens when exposed to a curing mechanism. Several activation mechanisms exist by which to initiate rigidization of such a structure, including elevated temperature, ultraviolet light, and chemical constituents of the inflation gas.

Integrating modulators would allow each array to transmit different data while the spectra of the transmitted signals are identical, thus disabling interception. The system enables secure point-to-point communications and can be used for short-distance wireless data transmission systems such as wireless LAN and RFID servers. As another aspect, self-steering signal transmission is employed for randomly oriented satellites using circularly polarized, two-dimensional retrodirective arrays. Quadruple subharmonic mixing is used as an effective means of achieving phase conjugation when a high-frequency LO is not feasible or inapplicable.

Integrating modulators would allow each array to transmit different data while the spectra of the transmitted signals are identical, thus disabling interception. The system enables secure point-to-point communications and can be used for short-distance wireless data transmission systems such as wireless LAN and RFID servers.

An error report may be compared to other previously-received error reports to determine similarity and facilitate diagnosing and resolving an error that generated the error report. In some implementations, the similarity may be determined by comparing frames included in a callstack of an error report to frames included in callstacks in other error reports to determine an edit distance between the callstacks, which may be based on the number and type of frame differences between callstacks. Each type of change may be weighted differently when determining the edit distance. Additionally or alternatively, the comparison may be performed by comparing a type of error, process names, and/or exception codes for the errors contained in the error reports. The similarity may be expressed as a probability that two error reports were generated as a result of a same error.",BARTZ KEVIN;;STOKES III JACK WILSON;;KIVETT RYAN S;;GRANT DAVID G;;LOIHLE GRETCHEN L;;CALINOIU SILVIU C;;MICROSOFT CORP,BARTZ KEVIN;;STOKES III JACK WILSON;;KIVETT RYAN S;;GRANT DAVID G;;LOIHLE GRETCHEN L;;CALINOIU SILVIU C,MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (2009-09-16),https://lens.org/025-607-397-946-003,Granted Patent,yes,6,55,2,2,0,G06F11/079;;G06F11/079;;G06F11/0709;;G06F11/0709;;H04L41/0631;;H04L41/0631,G06F11/07;;G06F11/20,714/746;;714/799,18,9,078-261-425-429-554;;120-019-031-774-596;;015-278-952-665-503;;037-426-533-320-56X;;016-149-127-818-130;;170-397-060-651-087;;090-182-186-756-679;;111-936-600-494-052;;026-251-266-866-697,10.1109/noms.2008.4575140;;10.1007/s10922-005-4443-8;;10.1109/icac.2005.49;;10.1109/issre.2004.43;;10.1017/cbo9780511574931;;10.1109/34.232078;;10.1093/comjnl/7.4.308;;10.1109/34.682181;;10.1145/1217935.1217972,"Bartz et al., ""Finding Similar Failures Using Callstack Similarity,"" Workshop on Tackling Computer Systems Problems with Machine Learning Techniques (SysML08), San Diego, CA 2008, 6 pages.;;Bocek et al., ""Fast Similarity Search in Peer-to-Peer Networks,"" Network Operations and Management Symposium, pp. 240-247 (2008) http://www.globis.ethz.ch/script/publication/download?docid=506, downloaded Jun. 29, 2009.;;Brodie, et al., ""Automated Problem Determination Using Call-Stack Matching,"" Journal of Network and Systems Management 13(2):219-237 (2005).;;Brodie et al., ""Quickly Finding Known Software Problems via Automated Symptom Matching,"" Proc 2nd Int'l Conference on Autonomic Computing, Int'l Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC) pp. 101-110, (2005) http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=01498056, downloaded Jun. 22, 2009.;;Chen et al., ""Pinpoint: Problem Determination in Large, Dynamic Internet Services,"" http://roc.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/roc-pinpoint-ipds.pdf, downloaded Jun. 29, 2009.;;Ding et al., ""Automatic Software Fault Diagnosis by Exploiting Application Signatures,"" Proc 22nd Large Installation System Administration Conference (LISA '08), San Diego, California, USENIX Association, Nov. 9-14, 2008, http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa08/tech/full-papers/ding/ding-html/, downloaded Jun. 23, 2009.;;Francis et al., ""Tree-Based Methods for Classifying Software Failures,"" Proc 15th Int'l Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE '04), http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=01383139, downloaded Jun. 22, 2009.;;Gusfield, D., ""Algorithms on Strings, Trees, and Sequences: Computer Science and Computational Biology,"" Cambridge University Press, pp. 41-60, (1997) http://portal.acm.org/ft-gateway.cfm?id=571472&type=pdf&coll=GUIDE&dl=GUIDE&CFID=42336784&CFTOKEN=13674140, downloaded Jun. 29, 2009.;;Lange, K., Numerical Analysis for Statisticians, Springer-Verlag, New York, NY, (2001), pp. 185-187.;;Levenshtein, V.I., ""Binary Codes Capable of Correcting Deletions, Insertions, and Reversals,"" Soviet Physics-Doklady 10(8): 707-710 (1966), http://sascha.geekheim.de/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/levenshtein.pdf, downloaded Jun. 29, 2009.;;McCullagh et al., Generalized Linear Models, 2nd ed., Chapman & Hall, 1989, pp. 114-115 and 248-249.;;Mao, Y., ""Automated Computer System Diagnosis by Machine Learning Approaches,"" http://www.research.att.com/~maoy/tr-05.pdf, pp. 1-31, downloaded Jun. 19, 2009.;;Marzal et al., ""Computation of Normalized Edit Distance and Applications,"" IEEE Trans. on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 15(9):926-932 (Sep. 1993), http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=232078&isnumber=6001, downloaded Jun. 29, 2009.;;Modani at al., Automatically Identifying Known Software Problems, ICDE Workshops, pp. 433-441 (2007) http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4401026&isnumber=4400943, downloaded Jun. 22, 2009.;;Nelder et al., ""A simplex method for function minimization,"" Computer Journal 7:308-313 (1965), downloaded Jun. 29, 2009.;;Podgurski et al., ""Automated Support for Classifying Software Failure Reports,"" http://www.cs.aub.edu.lb/wm13/ICSE2003.pdf, downloaded Jun. 29, 2009.;;Ristad et al., ""Learning String-Edit Distance,"" IEEE Trans. on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 20(5):522-532 (1998), http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=00682181, downloaded Jun. 22, 2009.;;Yuan et al., ""Automated Known Problem Diagnosis with Event Traces,"" EuroSys '06, Apr. 18-21, 2006, Leuven, Belgium, pp. 375-388, http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/jrwen/jrwen-files/publications/eurosys.pdf, downloaded Jun. 29, 2009.",ACTIVE

The legs fold into a very compact size that fit within the footprint of the camera, used for any type camera, e.g. compact point-and-shoot camera, camera phone, or SLR camera. The tripod can then live unnoticed on the bottom of the camera, until a shot requiring a tripod is needed. Then, the legs can be deployed to act as a firm stand. Another one of the main features of this tripod is that all the legs do not share a common end-point or pivot-point. This allows the legs to form a very wide stable platform, even when they are short. In general, for N legs, some legs may have common end-points or pivot-points, but not for all N legs.

An error report may be compared to other previously-received error reports to determine similarity and facilitate diagnosing and resolving an error that generated the error report. In some implementations, the similarity may be determined by comparing frames included in a callstack of an error report to frames included in callstacks in other error reports to determine an edit distance between the callstacks, which may be based on the number and type of frame differences between callstacks. Each type of change may be weighted differently when determining the edit distance. Additionally or alternatively, the comparison may be performed by comparing a type of error, process names, and/or exception codes for the errors contained in the error reports. The similarity may be expressed as a probability that two error reports were generated as a result of a same error.",MICROSOFT CORP,BARTZ KEVIN;;STOKES III JACK WILSON;;KIVETT RYAN S;;GRANT DAVID G;;LOIHLE GRETCHEN L;;CALINOIU SILVIU C,MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (2009-09-16),https://lens.org/130-245-995-804-356,Patent Application,yes,6,65,2,2,0,G06F11/079;;G06F11/079;;G06F11/0709;;G06F11/0709;;H04L41/0631;;H04L41/0631,G06F11/00,714/746;;X714E1101,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The turbine shroud segment has a segment casing (152) that has a radially outer surface (153) and a radially inner surface (154). The segment casing (152) houses a main plenum (160), a first layer of impingement chambers (158a), a second layer of impingement chambers (158b), and a plurality of effusion passages (166). The first layer of impingement chambers (158a) fluidly communicates with the main plenum (160) via transfer passages (162) that are formed in the segment casing (152). The second layer of impingement chambers (158b) fluidly communicates with the first layer of impingement chambers (158a) via impingement passages (164) that are formed in the segment casing (152).

The legs fold into a very compact size that fit within the footprint of the camera, used for any type camera, e.g. compact point-and-shoot camera, camera phone, or SLR camera. The tripod can then live unnoticed on the bottom of the camera, until a shot requiring a tripod is needed. Then, the legs can be deployed to act as a firm stand. Another one of the main features of this tripod is that all the legs do not share a common end-point or pivot-point. This allows the legs to form a very wide stable platform, even when they are short. In general, for N legs, some legs may have common end-points or pivot-points, but not for all N legs. (N is a positive integer, greater or equal to 3.) This invention can be applied to any camera (e.g. compact camera) and any measurement equipment that uses a conventional tripod or similar setup, such as the ones used by civil engineers or surveyors for the survey of the land and construction measurements or calibrations, or the ones used in optical measurements or laser experiments (e.g. for general level measurements and adjustments).

The drone data may be received and analyzed to identify losses to insured assets that should properly be classified as theft losses for insurance purposes. Insurance claims may be prepared or adjusted for insureds based upon the theft losses in accordance with various types of insurance policies (auto, home, personal articles, etc.) or endorsements to ensure that insureds are properly and promptly reimbursed for the theft losses.",STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE CO,TOFTE NATHAN L;;RYAN TIMOTHY W;;BAUMANN NATHAN W;;JACOB MICHAEL SHAWN;;LILLIE JOSHUA DAVID;;HARVEY BRIAN N;;LYONS ROXANE;;GRANT ROSEMARIE GEIER,STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE COMPANY (2015-10-15),https://lens.org/031-398-532-426-123,Patent Application,yes,0,8,27,27,0,G06T7/75;;G06Q40/08;;B64U10/14;;B64U2101/30;;G06Q40/08;;G06T7/75;;G06T7/20;;G06T2207/30236;;G06T2207/30252;;H04N5/44;;H04N7/185;;G06T7/246;;G06T7/00;;G06V20/10;;G06V20/41;;G06V20/44;;G06Q40/00;;G06F18/22;;B64U10/00;;B64U2101/00;;B64U2101/30;;G06V10/42;;G01C11/02;;G06T11/60;;G06T17/05;;G06T2207/10032;;G06T2207/30232;;G06T2215/16;;B64C39/024;;B64D47/08,G06Q40/08,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

According to certain aspects, a central monitoring server may receive and examine data detected by at least one unmanned vehicle and generate an estimated insurance claim for a loss event. The central monitoring server may then receive an actual insurance claim relating to the loss event, and may compare the estimated insurance claim to the actual insurance claim to identify potential buildup included in the actual insurance claim. If buildup is detected, the central monitoring server may then process the actual insurance claim accordingly based upon the potential buildup. As a result, claim monies may be paid to insureds that more accurately reflect actual losses resulting from the loss event, and insurance cost savings may be ultimately passed onto typical insurance customers.",STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE CO,TOFTE NATHAN L;;RYAN TIMOTHY W;;BAUMANN NATHAN W;;JACOB MICHAEL SHAWN;;LILLIE JOSHUA DAVID;;HARVEY BRIAN N;;LYONS ROXANE;;GRANT ROSEMARIE GEIER,,https://lens.org/086-426-487-122-745,Granted Patent,yes,173,0,27,27,0,G06T7/75;;G06Q40/08;;B64U10/14;;B64U2101/30;;G06Q40/08;;G06T7/75;;G06T7/20;;G06T2207/30236;;G06T2207/30252;;H04N5/44;;H04N7/185;;G06T7/246;;G06T7/00;;G06V20/10;;G06V20/41;;G06V20/44;;G06Q40/00;;G06F18/22;;B64U10/00;;B64U2101/00;;B64U2101/30;;G06V10/42;;G01C11/02;;G06T11/60;;G06T17/05;;G06T2207/10032;;G06T2207/30232;;G06T2215/16;;B64C39/024;;B64D47/08,G06Q40/08,,38,2,004-209-791-402-703;;091-345-395-848-705,10.1109/aero.2014.6836448;;10.1109/fskd.2017.8392963,"C.
