The handle has a small window on one side to allow for at least actuation of the internal liner about locking mechanisms thereof. The surgical blade and attaching mechanism that may be located on the proximal end of the handle uses a blade that can quickly and safely be attached and removed from the handle via a rotating and locking mechanism. There is also a cover shield to cover a blade of the scalpel.,HUTCHISON JOSEPH L;;DUDLEY CALVIN;;TRIMARCHE ROBERT;;ELLEGALA DILANTHA B,HUTCHISON JOSEPH L;;DUDLEY CALVIN;;TRIMARCHE ROBERT;;ELLEGALA DILANTHA B,,https://lens.org/086-804-844-949-712,Search Report,yes,9,0,3,3,0,A61B17/3213;;A61B17/3213;;A61B2017/00367;;A61B2017/00477;;A61B2017/32113,A61B17/3211;;A61B17/3213;;A61B17/3217,,0,0,,,,PENDING
