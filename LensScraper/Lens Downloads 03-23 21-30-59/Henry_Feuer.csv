SOLUTION: After a conductive ring 24 and a bearing 30 are inserted into a mold, a slip ring main body 202 is injection-molded. At the time of an injection molding process the ring 24 and the bearing 30 are partially made into capsules by plastic injected and are held. By using a pair of additional plastic inserts, plastic is prevented from flowing into a race of the bearing 30. When injected plastic is cooled, plastic contracts, the bearing 30 is pressed and axial moving of the bearing 30 is prevented. A slip ring 200 has a plurality of the rings 24 and these rings 24 are separated by a part extending in the radial direction.
