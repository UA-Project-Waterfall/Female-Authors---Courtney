The improved cap is provided with a central button feature in its top panel that can move slightly upward or downward with respect to the remainder of the cap. When a container is filled, liquid Nitrogen is added just before the cap is applied. The liquid Nitrogen turns into gas and creates pressure in the container, causing the button to rise. Other methods can be used to pressurize the contents. When a consumer opens the cap, the gas is released and the button returns to its normal (down) position, or if pressure is accidentally lost the button returns to its normal (down) position. Thus, this feature will indicate loss of pressurization before intended opening, and possible resulting spoilage, or will indicate to the consumer that the container has been open, and may contain only partial product, if he should replace the cap to protect remaining product. A coin ring is used to coin the metal of the cap central portion in a band of relatively narrow width and of significantly lesser diameter than the cap itself. This creates slack metal from down in the near-center area of the panel, and results in an ‘oil can’ configuration, which responds to the increased internal pressure upon filling & closing by causing the central area to “click” or snap to an extended (outward) position. When the container is opened, internal pressure is released and the central area returns to its state before filling. In the meantime, if internal pressure is lowered sufficiently (e.g. below a predetermined value) or released, the central area of the cap will snap inward (with an audible click) to indicate the internal pressure has been compromised or lost.",DAYTON SYSTEMS GROUP INC CORP,COOK STEVEN T;;BROERMAN MARK F;;CONLEY DALE R,DAYTON SYSTEMS GROUP INC (2004-09-07),https://lens.org/015-153-934-109-520,Patent Application,yes,20,8,2,2,0,B65D81/2053;;B65D79/0087;;B65D81/2053;;B65D79/0087,B65D79/00;;B65D81/20,220/293;;215/332,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

Nests for carrying can end shells are attached at their opposite edges to the belt. The belt is supported by and routed around an idler drum, located outside the press frame posts and by a toothed drive drum located within the press frame adjacent the opposite frame posts. Progressive conversion tooling for making shells into completed easy-open can ends is located between the posts above and below upper and lower tooling sets. The drive drum is provided with circumferential teeth for a positive drive to the belt. Attachments of nests to the belt are located on transverse center lines which permit the flat nests to travel around the end turns of the belts. Shells are positively seated into the nests and held by a circular array of independent flexible stepped fingers as the nests are transferred through the conversion tooling. Completed ends are carried around the drum at the end of the upper flight, and the ends are ejected from the nest rings and moved as by force from air streams along a table or chutes. These chutes receive the ends from the lower or return flight of the conveyor, providing a compact (end-to-end) conveying system.

    The transfer conveyor system utilizes at least one endless conveyor belt of reinforced flexible rubber-like material with cogs or teeth on its underside and with a series of nests fitted into holes in the belt. Nests for carrying can end shells are attached at their opposite edges to the belt. The belt is supported by and routed around an idler drum, located outside the press frame posts and by a toothed drive drum located within the press frame adjacent the opposite frame posts. Progressive conversion tooling for making shells into completed easy-open can ends is located between the posts above and below upper and lower tooling sets. The drive drum is provided with circumferential teeth for a positive drive to the belt. Attachments of nests to the belt are located on transverse center lines which permit the flat nests to travel around the end turns of the belts. Shells are positively seated into the nests and held by a circular array of independent flexible stepped fingers as the nests are transferred through the conversion tooling. Completed ends are carried around the drum at the end of the upper flight, and the ends are ejected from the nest rings and moved as by force from air streams along a table or chutes. These chutes receive the ends from the lower or return flight of the conveyor, providing a compact (end-to-end) conveying system.

The belt with attached nests, having end shells trapped therein, is moved stepwise through progressive conversion tooling for making shells into completed can ends. Shells are positively seated into the nests by moving the shells through a discontinuous entrance rim, preferably defined by the upper parts of a circular array of independent flexible stepped (preferably L-shaped) fingers which support the shells which are each trapped in a nest as the nests are transferred through the conversion tooling. Completed ends may be carried around the end of the conveyor upper flight, and the ends can be ejected from the nests.

Where the material is Portland cement concrete and the standard is ASTM C457-90, the analysis is operable to calculate estimates of sixteen characteristics to detect voids in the concrete, while discriminating against other components and features of the concrete. The preferred system broadly comprises a microscope; a high-precision stage; an image capturing mechanism; and a computing device. Analysis techniques applied to the image include color segmentation and recognition; shape feature segmentation and analysis; and intensity profile segmentation and recognition; the results of which are integrated to provide a final result wherefrom quality of the material may be determined.

For example, the system may detect excess accumulation by comparing the monitored values of a speed control signal with one or more reference values corresponding to nominal accumulation conditions. Whether or not the motor is speed controlled, the apparatus may use a shared motor that drives one or more image forming process members and the toner distributing member.

    A method and system for managing the transfer of data into and out of a buffer in a disc drive is disclosed. The operation of the vectored buffer management (VBM) system is administered by a software-based control module. The control module creates and maintains a buffer table by dividing the buffer table into buffer sectors. The buffer sectors are further arranged into buffer segments, or circularly linked lists upon which the buffer table is partitioned. The control module effectuates the transfer by implementing an application module across the buffer table. Once the application module is arbitrarily positioned at an index sector by the control module, data transfer is accomplished when the application module walks through a particular buffer segment identified by the index sector. Specific control of the application module across a buffer segment is administered through host and disc address pointers, which are coupled to host and disc next pointers, respectively.

The control module creates and maintains a buffer table by dividing the buffer table into buffer sectors. The buffer sectors are further arranged into buffer segments, or circularly linked lists upon which the buffer table is partitioned. The control module effectuates the transfer by implementing an application module across the buffer table. Once the application module is arbitrarily positioned at an index sector by the control module, data transfer is accomplished when the application module walks through a particular buffer segment identified by the index sector. Specific control of the application module across a buffer segment is administered through host and disc address pointers, which are coupled to host and disc next pointers, respectively.
