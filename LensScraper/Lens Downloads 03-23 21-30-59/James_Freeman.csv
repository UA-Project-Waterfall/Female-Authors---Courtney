Freeman, J. Aug. 1, 1918 Breasting.-Heel-breasting and other cutting machines are provided with improved one-revolution driving mechanism, and the work is clamped on an adjustable pivoted table against an adjustable gauge that is automatically withdrawn from and returned to the path of the cutter during and by the latter's respective descent and ascent. The cutter is actuated from a shaft 1 driven for a single revolution through gearing 2, 3 from a belt pulley 5 by the longitudinal displacement of a rod 18 acting on a pivoted lever 21 which deflects a pivoted stop 13 from 'beneath a cam'12, thereby enabling a spring-actuated wedge 14 to displace its complementary wedge 16 to secure frictional drive of the clutch members 5, 6. The movement of the wedge 14 and its appurtenances. immediately disengage the lever 21 from the stop 13, which resumes its vertical position under the action of a spring 28, and is depressed by the cam 12 to allow the member 5 to be declutched from the member 6 by a spring 17 to stop the shaft 1 after one revolution thereof. The disengagement of the lever 21 serves to prevent a second actuation of the machine, even through the starting rod 18 be held from return to its normal position. The work is supported on a table 29 pivoted to supports 30 and adjusted by screws 31. A resiliently adjustable edge gauge 40 is carried by a spring-controlled lever 42 pivoted at 43, its upwardly curved portion being adapted to bear on the cutter slide 11, so that the ascent of the latter serves to swing the gauge into its operative position, and the descent to allow the spring 45, acting on the lever 42, to withdraw the gauge from the path of the cutter. The cutter is mounted for vertical adjustment in its slide 11, and the work is clamped by a foot-actuated resilient clamp 33.",FREEMAN JAMES,FREEMAN JAMES,,https://lens.org/013-228-284-345-476,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,A43D87/00,A43D87/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A cylindrical enclosure 81 with a pipe 82 for connection to a vacuum pump has a tubular extension 83 housing a lens assembly with a window or mass-defining slit of width equal to that of the target. Target holder 87 is secured to a lead screw 84 driven by a motor 85 controlled by a programmer 86. Rotation of the target holder is prevented by a torque resisting tube 88, but it is free to slide up and down as indicated by arrow B. The holder supports a plurality of racks filled with wafers 89. After implantation of one row of wafers the holder is indexed one step by fingers 92 and 93 engaging cam surfaces 94 and 95 fixed to the enclosure 81. The wafers may be heated by radiation or may be cooled by plates cooled with liquid nitrogen. An alternative embodiment (Figs. 2 to 5, not shown) comprises a magnetic separator as described in Specification 6,280,011, an ion source as described in Specification 6,280,012, and a target chamber in which means are provided for loading and unloading wafers to and from a carrier which is mounted on an X-Y drive mechanism which may be automatically programmed. The ion beam is swept over the window by superimposing an alternating voltage from a sweep generator on the stabilized D.C. supply to an accelerating electrode of the ion gun. The beam stabilizing means may comprise a probe (Fig. 1, not shown-see Division G3) which samples the ion beam at the window and passes a signal through an amplifier to a sweep control which controls the amplitude of the sweep in such a way as to tend to reduce variations in the ion beam intensity.",ATOMIC ENERGY AUTHORITY UK,FREEMAN JAMES HARRY,,https://lens.org/080-527-892-452-881,Granted Patent,no,0,2,10,10,0,B01D59/48;;H01J49/022;;H01J49/025;;Y10S438/961;;B01D59/48;;H01J49/022;;H01J49/025;;Y10S438/961,H01J37/317;;B01D59/48;;B23K15/00;;G21K5/08;;H01J49/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The source incorporates a single heated filament 1 to evaporate the material to be ionised and an independently heated coil 2 which acts as the ionising element. The filament is positioned close to one end of the coil so that a major fraction of the evaporated material enters the coil and has a high probability of coming into repeated contact with the internal ionising surface before escaping from the open end. The voltage gradient between the two ends of the coil which arises from its resistance to the direct current used to heat it helps to steer and accelerate any ions which are produced towards the open end where they can then be further accelerated by electrode 3 and extracted as an ion beam. In modifications, the coil may be conical, and an external magnetic field may be provided to cancel or augment that of the coil itself. Apart from mass spectrometry, other uses include ion beam machining and implantation, and ion probes. <IMAGE>",FREEMAN JAMES HARRY,FREEMAN JAMES HARRY,,https://lens.org/003-284-621-637-845,Patent Application,no,3,5,3,3,0,H01J49/16,H01J49/16,H1D DHBB          HBB;;H1D DHBX          HBX;;H1D D17AY         HBB;;H1D D17AY         HBX;;H1D D17A2A        HBB;;H1D D17A2A        HBX;;H1D D17A2Y        HBB;;H1D D17A2Y        HBX;;H1D D18C          HBB;;H1D D18C          HBX;;H1D D44           HBB;;H1D D44           HBX;;H1D D51           HBB;;H1D D51           HBX,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Both the ion source and the target chamber are maintained at earth potential. The positive ion beam, thus generated, accelerates due to the voltage V4 and is converted to negative ions, as it passes through lithium vapour within the change exchanger cell, and is further accelerated due to the fall in potential on reaching the target.

Provision is made for detecting the dominant periodicity of this electrical signal, preferably as the time average of zero crossings of the signal about its own average value. A first analog signal is developed having a DC magnitude which is proportional to the frequency of the periodicity. A hybrid filter is used to develop the first signal by analog to digital conversion, counting and averaging the zero crossings and reconverting the average count in analog form. A second analog signal is developed, the DC magnitude of which is proportional to the strength of the signal received from the subject. These first and second analog signals are used to control the output of various indicators having signals which are perceptible to the subject to thereby complete a feedback loop. In a preferred form of the invention these analog signals are used to control the output of a noise source so as to vary the spectral content of the noise source between high and low values in response to a change of the frequency of the signal from the subject.

    An anatomical brace for stabilizing and supporting a uniting pivoting joint such as a knee joint disposed between a first limb structure and a second limb structure. The brace includes first and second cuffs and a pivotable brace joint there between with two opposing pivoting assemblies. Each assembly includes forward and rearward arm members in tandem and a frame structure having a first end attached to the first cuff and a second end attached to the second cuff. Extending between the cuffs is an adjustable joint extension limiter for regulating pivotable distance of the cuffs in relation to each other. Spherical sockets movably positioned within the frame structure permit naturally-occurring multi-planar joint movement such that the brace here defined effectively limits pivotal extension distance, yet permits normal joint bendability with multi planar movability up to such limit, thereby stabilizing and supporting joint-controlled limb unions.

    A system and method for performing corneal ablation or reshaping with a laser in order to correct aberrations in the optical system of the eye utilizes a wavefront sensor which defines a wavefront correction for the eye and then, based upon that defined wavefront correction, drives a digital micromirror device (DMD) which modulates a laser beam to the eye to perform the correction. As the DMD is a 2-D array of individually controlled mirrors, and the wavefront sensor analysis can provide a sequence of two dimensional arrays of values which together define the wavefront correction for the eye, the combination of the two produces a method for correcting the corneal surface. The system may be operated in either of two manners to achieve optimum refractive corrections: (1) off-line measurement of the eye optical system via the wavefront sensor followed by DMD-based laser refractive surgery, or (2) real-time measurement of the eye optical system via the wavefront sensor which directs a DMD-based laser refractive surgery system.

Immunization of mice with these immune-complexes resulted in the development of a monoclonal antibody (FB2) to a novel nucleolar proliferation associated antigen which has a molecular weight of about 120 kD and a pI of about 4.5. By indirect immunofluorescence, antibody FB2 produced bright nucleolar staining in a variety of malignant tumors, including cancers of the breast, liver, gastro­intestinal tract, genitourinary tract, blood, lung and brain. Specific nucleolar immunofluorescence was not detectable in most normal tissues, although it was weakly detectable in some proliferating nonmalignant tissues including spermatogonia of the tests, ductal regions of hypertrophied prostate, and PHA stimulated lymphocytes. Disclosed are characterizations and methods for isolating nucleolar antigen p120, characterizations and methods for producing antibodies including monoclonal antibody having binding specificity to nucleolar antigen p120, and diagnostic procedures and kits useful for detecting human cancer cells.

Immunization of mice with these immune-complexes resulted in the development of a monoclonal antibody (FB2) to a novel nucleolar proliferation associated antigen which has a molecular weight of about 120 kD and a pI of about 4.5. By indirect immunofluorescence, antibody FB2 produced bright nucleolar staining in a variety of malignant tumors, including cancers of the breast, liver, gastro­intestinal tract, genitourinary tract, blood, lung and brain. Specific nucleolar immunofluorescence was not detectable in most normal tissues, although it was weakly detectable in some proliferating nonmalignant tissues including spermatogonia of the tests, ductal regions of hypertrophied prostate, and PHA stimulated lymphocytes. Disclosed are characterizations and methods for isolating nucleolar antigen p120, characterizations and methods for producing antibodies including monoclonal antibody having binding specificity to nucleolar antigen p120, and diagnostic procedures and kits useful for detecting human cancer cells.

SOLUTION: A node 211 is kept lower than the conductive threshold value of a transistor 205. However, at the time of the power failure of a power source voltage Vdd, the voltage of the gate of a transistor 204 drops more than the voltage of a node 203 by more than a threshold value and the transistor 204 is continued. Thereby an electric charge stored on the voltage node 203 by the capacitor 202 is shared with a node 211 to boost the voltage of the transistor 205 to more than a conducting threshold value. Thus, a discharging line 206 drops the voltage of the node 203 to be sensed to make a power source reset signal a high value. By this method, reliability of detecting the loss of a power source voltage is improve due to the electric charge stored at the capacitor 202.",AT & T CORP,RONALD RAMMER FREEMAN;;MICHAEL JAMES HANTER,,https://lens.org/158-412-382-321-089,Patent Application,no,0,0,2,2,0,H03K17/223;;H03K17/223,H03K17/22,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The computer includes an interface to control the corneal illuminator, a video frame grabber which extracts images of the eye cornea from the video camera, and is programmed to detect and recognize eye corneal striae. The striae detection algorithm finds possible cornea striae, determines their location, or position, on the cornea and analyzes their shape. After all possible eye corneal striae are detected and analyzed, they are displayed for the surgeon on an external video display. The surgeon can then make a determination as to whether the corneal LASIK flap should be refloated, adjusted or smoothed again.

   An automated eye corneal striae detection system for use with a refractive laser system includes a cornea illuminator, a video camera interface, a computer, and a video display for showing possible eye corneal striae to the surgeon. The computer includes an interface to control the corneal illuminator, a video frame grabber that extracts images of the eye cornea from the video camera, and is programmed to detect and recognize eye corneal striae. The striae detection algorithm finds possible cornea striae, determines their location, or position, on the cornea and analyzes their shape. After all possible eye corneal striae are detected and analyzed, they are displayed for the surgeon on an external video display. The surgeon can then make a determination as to whether the corneal LASIK flap should be refloated, adjusted or smoothed again.

Firth, A. F., and Green, J. H. May 30. Shuttleless looms ; forming selvedges.-In a loom for weaving tufted fabrics or carpets, the wefts are inserted in looped form by means of two needles 1, 1<A> of unequal length, which are arranged vertically one above the other and are operated in the ordinary manner. Two selvedge shuttles are actuated in curved boxes or races 4, 5 by oscillating arms 6, 6<A>, to traverse the loops and retain the wefts within the fabric, the upper shuttle being actuated at every pick and the lower shuttle at each alternate pick. The arms 6, 6<A> are secured to a vertical shaft 7 and a sleeve 8 respectively, and the shaft and sleeve are rocked as required by means of suitable cranks, connecting- rods, and levers, which are actuated by cams on the tappet-shaft, the cams being arranged preferably at opposite ends of the tappet-shaft. The wefts pass from cans through suitable guide-eyes and tension devices to the eyes 28<A> in the needles. The tension device for the upper weft consists of a vibrating arm, round which the weft passes, while the lower weft passes between a stationary part 22 and a cam-actuated hammer 21, and through the eye 25 of a spring-pressed pivoted arm 26. When the lower weft is to be retained in the fabric, the hammer 21 is moved away from the part 22 and the weft is released, and when it is not to be retained, it is held between the hammer and the part 22, and, when the needles recede, the slack in the lower weft is taken up by the arm 26. To prevent undue vibration of the needles and to retain them in correct position clear of the centre shed, they are provided with small runners 24A, which are preferably rubber-tyred. In the Provisional Specification, it is stated that the needles and their slide are preferably made of aluminium.",FIRTH ALGERNON FREEMAN;;GREEN JAMES HENRY,FIRTH ALGERNON FREEMAN;;GREEN JAMES HENRY,,https://lens.org/178-940-932-076-781,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

In an exemplary scenario, the sets of sequenced units of digital data are sets of time-ordered media samples forming clips of media content, and the techniques are applied when media samples from two or more clips are simultaneously presentable to a user as independently-controlled streams. Variable amounts of sharable memory are dynamically allocated for preparing upcoming media samples for presentation to the user. In one possible implementation, a ratio of average data rates of individual streams is calculated, and amounts of sharable memory are allocated to rendering each stream based on the ratio.

    A laser eye surgery system includes a laser for producing a laser beam capable of making refractive corrections, an optical system for shaping and conditioning the laser beam, a digital micromirror device (DMD) for reflecting the shaped and conditioned beam toward the eye, a computer system for controlling the mirrors of the DMD, and an eye tracking system which tracks the position of the eye and provides feedback to the computer system. The computer system includes software which permits the DMD to emulate the patterns and laser beam control provided in all prior art broadbeam systems and scanning spot systems. All that is required is a selection in the software to operate thereunder. Moreover, the laser surgery system can be coupled to or adapted to receive data from corneal topographers or wavefront sensor systems and utilize such data to increase the quality of correction above and beyond prior approaches. Furthermore, the laser surgery system can provide much greater resolution than prior art systems.

Heath, A. W., Freeman, R. J., and Phillips, S. March 10. Guards, controlling.-The guard for a power or other press is arranged so that the two hands of the operator are required for starting the press, and means are also provided for closing the guard should the ram accidentally fall. The starting-lever j is returned to the out of gear ' position by a spring and is retained in that position by means of a weighted detent k, which is released by a projection a<1> on the guard a when the guard is moved to the closed position against the action of a spring. Thus, in starting the press, one hand of the operator is required to retain the guard, while the other hand is employed in moving the lever j. A quadrant f adjustably connected to the press ram e. carries a roller engaging a lever c pivoted at one end to a bar b carried by the press and engaging through a roller c<3>, an inclined plate d on the guard. Should the ram fall, the lever e is depressed and forces the guard to the closed position, removing the operator's arm out of danger. The sudden movement of the guard causes abnormal depression )f a buffer n and enables a detent o to engage a pin p on the guard to retain it in the closed position.

The distal end portion has a cylindrical shaped surface pivotally seated in a mating socket formed in a slide block positioned within the actuator slot. The actuating forces transmitted from the actuator to the lever are thus transmitted in a straight line motion with minimal torsional stresses introduced into the lever.,CATERPILLAR INC,FREEMAN PHILLIP L;;GOADE JAMES C;;WERNER CLAUDE H,CATERPILLAR INC (1994-04-27),https://lens.org/046-362-910-526-894,Granted Patent,yes,4,7,3,3,0,F01B3/108;;F01B3/108,F02B75/32;;F01B3/02;;F01B3/10;;F04B1/20,92/12.2;;91/505;;417/222.1;;417/269,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Preferred comonomers are hexafluoropropylene and perfluoroalkylvinyl ether. The co-continuous morphology is provide by first forming a first phase polymer, then adding one or more comonomers before half of the original monomer stream has been added, and at an effective level to cause phase separation of the copolymer. The co-continuous morphology provides a means for incorporating a high level of comonomer into the copolymer with little or no adverse effect on the melting temperature. The morphology also provides the copolymer composition with a unique combination of properties, including a high melting point, good flexibility and good low temperature impact resistance. The unique properties of the polymer make it useful in end-use application where those properties provide performance advantages, such as in the wire and cable market, and in oil and gas applications.",ARKEMA INC,FREEMAN ADAM W;;HENRY JAMES J;;SEILER DAVID A,,https://lens.org/063-609-995-420-260,Patent Application,yes,3,7,10,10,0,C08L27/16;;C08F259/08;;C09D127/16;;C08L2205/025;;C08L2205/04;;C08F214/22;;C08L27/16;;C08F259/08;;C09D127/16;;C08L2205/025;;C08L2205/04;;C08F214/22;;C08F2/01;;C08F2/10,C08L27/16,,0,0,,,,PENDING

   An automated eye corneal striae detection system for use with a refractive laser system includes a cornea illuminator, a video camera interface, a computer, and a video display for showing possible eye corneal striae to the surgeon. The computer includes an interface to control the corneal illuminator, a video frame grabber that extracts images of the eye cornea from the video camera, and is programmed to detect and recognize eye corneal striae. The striae detection algorithm finds possible cornea striae, determines their location, or position, on the cornea and analyzes their shape. After all possible eye corneal striae are detected and analyzed, they are displayed for the surgeon on an external video display. The surgeon can then make a determination as to whether the corneal LASIK flap should be refloated, adjusted or smoothed again.

Because the lyophilized pliable medical device is porous, it adsorbs blood and other beneficial cells containing body fluids, such as bone marrow, contributing to its superior bone repair efficacy in comparison to an analogous putty that has not been lyophilized. In addition these lyophilized pliable medical devices are easier to terminally steam sterilize than the analogous putty because there is no moisture present to boil and ""blow-out"" of the containment device (syringe).

Because the lyophilized pliable medical device is porous, it adsorbs blood and other beneficial cells containing body fluids, such as bone marrow, contributing to its superior bone repair efficacy in comparison to an analogous putty that has not been lyophilized. In addition these lyophilized pliable medical devices are easier to terminally steam sterilize than the analogous putty because there is no moisture present to boil and ""blow-out"" of the containment device (syringe).
