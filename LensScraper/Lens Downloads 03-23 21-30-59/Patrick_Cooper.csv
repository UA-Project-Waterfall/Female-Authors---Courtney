Gramophone records. DECCA RECORD CO., Ltd. Jan. 20, 1953 [March 14, 1952], No. 6738/52. Class 40 (2). In a disc-recording machine having means for cutting a run-off groove and an eccentric terminal groove in one operation, the centre of the record disc is displaced from the centre of rotation during the cutting of the spiral run-off groove, and subsequently the radial traverse of the cutter head is stopped so that an eccentric terminal groove is cut. In the embodiment described, a turntable 10 carrying a recording wax 11 has a centre-pin 12 mounted on a slide 14 which may be moved to displace the centre-pin 17 one eighth of an inch from the centre of the turntable 10 under the influence of a cam 17 pivoted at a point 18 on a fixed part of the machine. The slide 14 carries a cam-follower 16, and the cam 17 is movable inwards by a solenoid 25 which acts through a dashpot 20, spring 21 and spring-loaded bellcrank 23. During recording, the pin 12 is in the central position of the turntable 10, but when the end of the recording is reached, the operator actuates a ""scroll-out"" switch which greatly increases the radial traverse of the cutter head, and energises the solenoid 20 to move the cam 17 to the operative position, thereby moving the recording wax 11 out of centre on the turntable 10. When the recording cutter reaches a predetermined position, a micro-switch is actuated to stop the radial traverse, so that during the next revolution a complete circle is cut, which owing to the displacement of the wax 11 is eccentric with regard to the centre of the. recording on the wax. The cutter head is then raised.",DECCA RECORD CO LTD,COOPER PATRICK BERNARD,,https://lens.org/121-968-350-932-476,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G11B3/00,G11B3/00,G5R RED           RED;;G5R RFN           RFN;;G5R R21D          --;;G5R R21F          --;;G5R R21Y          --;;G5R R22BY         --;;G5R R22B3A        --;;G5R R22B3Y        --;;G5R R22B4BY       --;;G5R R22B4B1       --;;G5R R22B4Y        --;;G5R R22B5A        --;;G5R R22B5Y        --;;G5R R22DU         --;;G5R R22DY         --;;G5R R22EY         --;;G5R R22E3AY       --;;G5R R22E3A1       --;;G5R R22E3B        --;;G5R R22E3Y        --;;G5R R22E6E        --;;G5R R22E6Y        --;;G5R R25J          --,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Subscription television system; line transmission system. R. & R. RESEARCH Ltd. April 3, 1964 [April 16, 1963], No. 14809/63. Headings H4L and H4R. In a subscription television system, which is stated to be of use with either wire or radio distribution, the transmitter transmits audio and video signals modulated on respective carriers 1 and 2, Fig. 14, together with interference carriers 3 and 4 which serve to inhibit proper reproduction by an unauthorized receiver, a receiver for use with the system being provided with filter means to eliminate the interference carriers. Thus a receiver may have filter means with a transmission characteristic as illustrated in Fig. 1B which normally serves to reject the carriers 1 and 2 but which may be changed to have a characteristic as illustrated in Fig. 1C whereby the interference carriers may be rejected. Such a receiver is shown in Fig. 2 where incoming signals at 5 pass to a reproducer 12 by way of either filter means 11 or filter means 13 as determined by the setting of contacts 9, 10 of a relay 7 which is controlled by a coin box or debit indicating mechanism 8. As an alternative to the use of two filter means, only one may be provided together with means for changing the characteristic, e.g. by adjustment or insertion of a capacitor. Reference is also made to a system in which a fixed payment is made for the use of the system but only certain receivers in the system contract to use the facility. For this purpose all the receivers are provided with filter means, those in contracting receivers having a fixed characteristic as in Fig. 1C and those in the other receivers having a fixed characteristic as in Fig. 1B. Interference carrier 4 may be spaced from carrier 2 by 0.5-0.75 Mc/s.; the spacing of carriers 3 and 4 may be the same as the spacing of carriers 1 and 2. The interference carriers may be modulated by a signal at a frequency, e.g., 10 c/s., below television field frequency, or by. price information, programme identification and audio announcement signals. The frequencies of the carriers may also be changed from time to time. The amplitude of the interference carriers may also be made greater than that of carriers 1 and 2 so that when they are not rejected they cause the receiver automaticgain-control to suppress picture and sound reproduction. The system may include the pricing and recording arrangements disclosed in Specification 1, 010, 081.",R & R RES LTD,BASS PATRICK;;COOPER JOHN MAURICE,,https://lens.org/019-374-116-255-870,Granted Patent,no,0,3,2,3,0,H04N7/164;;H04N7/166;;H04N7/164;;H04N7/166,H04N7/16,H4L LBSM          LBSM;;H4L LUM           NONE;;H4L LX            NONE;;H4L L18F          -;;H4L L18H          -;;H4R RCS           RCS;;H4R RPTS          RPTS;;H4R R17B1B        -;;H4R R17T          RCS;;H4R R22V          RPTS;;H4R R22X          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A wavelet transformation is performed on the group of pixels to obtain a general approximation coefficient (a DC value), and a plurality of detail coefficients (AC values) for the group of pixels. When compressing the data, it is determined whether to prioritise transmission of the DC coefficient over transmission of the AC coefficients based on availability of resources and/or based on a time since AC coefficients for a corresponding group of pixels were previously transmitted. If transmission of the DC coefficient is to be prioritised over transmission of the AC coefficients, the method comprises either: transmitting the DC coefficient only, or compressing at least one AC coefficient, which may include quantisation, so as to be more compressed than the DC coefficient and then transmitting the DC coefficient and the at least one compressed AC coefficient. An advantage of the invention is that if the client device receives a DC coefficient only, it can retrieve AC coefficients from previously received frames. The previously received AC values may be stored locally (S4N1, fig 4b).",DISPLAYLINK UK LTD,RICHARD AKESTER;;PATRICK DAVID COOPER,,https://lens.org/100-496-357-243-716,Patent Application,no,4,0,5,5,0,G09G2350/00;;G09G2360/18;;G09G2340/02;;G09G2370/025;;G06F3/14;;G09G2370/022;;G09G2370/042;;H04N19/63;;H04N19/63;;G06T9/00;;G09G5/37;;G09G2340/02;;G09G2350/00;;G09G2360/18;;G09G2370/02;;H03M7/3059;;H04N19/00;;H04N1/3217,H04N19/63,,1,0,,,"(JVET-M0354-v3) Joint Video Experts Team (JVET) of ITU-T SG 16 WP 3 and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 11; ""CE6-related: MTS with Haar transform for Screen Contents Coding""; 13th Meeting: Marrakech, MA, 9 18 Jan. 2019 < http://phenix.it-sudparis.eu/jvet/ >",ACTIVE

The number of teeth on the pinions and the gear wheels may be arranged so that the turntable may be driven at 78, 45 or 33<SP>1</SP>/ 3 r.p.m. Each pinion is driven by a separate motor 15 through a flexible coupling comprising a helical spring 20 and a rubber block 21. The motors may be mounted in gimbals carried by rubber blocks. Each pinion is forced into engagement with the gear wheels by pressing a button 31 which moves a slide 24 fixed to a ball race 22 carrying the spindle 18 of the.flexible coupling. After pressing a button, it is held in position by a member 35 which engages a recess 34. When another button is pressed, a cam surface 37 releases the member 35 from the button already pressed. The pinions are normally held away from the gear wheels by springs 26. The gear wheels may be made of compressed fibrous material.",DECCA RECORD CO LTD,O'BRIEN WILLIAM JOSEPH;;COOPER PATRICK BERNARD,,https://lens.org/043-987-238-132-707,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G11B33/02,G11B33/02,G5R RFE           RFE;;G5R R21F          --;;G5R R21Y          --;;G5R R22BY         --;;G5R R22B5A        --;;G5R R22B5Y        --;;G5R R22DY         --;;G5R R22D6         --;;G5R R22K          --;;H2A AVG           VG,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

C., and O'Donnell, P. June 14. Pedals.-Relates to an attachment to pedals of bicycles &c. for retaining them in a horizontal position. Fig. 2 shows the attachment fitted to a pedal provided with a toe clip. A sheet-metal piece consisting of a flat slotted part a which may form the back-plate for the toe-clip and is secured by the bolt c to the pedal, a strip-like .extension a<1> which passes over the pedal barrel, and a downward extension a<2>, carries a screwed stem b which terminates in a weighted part b<1>. The screwed stem is fixed in position by the adjusting-nuts d, e. The weight b<1> is sufficient to balance the weight of the toe-clip. In this case the part a', a<2> is as near as possible to the crank side of the pedal, but for tricycles and like velocipedes the part a<1>, a<2> may be central. When a toe-clip is not used, the pedal may be preserved in a horizontal position by reversing the stem b in the part a'. The part a, a<1>, a<2> may be attached to the pedal barrel or the side or end plates, or the adjustable weight may be fixed on a prolongation of the pedal. The Provisional Specification describes a form in which the toe-clip and the balancing-attachment are formed in one piece or attached to each other.",COLLINS REUBEN JOHN COOPER;;O'DONNELL PATRICK,COLLINS REUBEN JOHN COOPER;;O'DONNELL PATRICK,,https://lens.org/067-161-987-684-330,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Pick-ups. DECCA RECORD CO. Ltd. Feb. 4, 1959 [Nov. 5, 1957], No. 34508/57. Class 40 (4). In a variable reluctance pick-up for reproducing from a single groove two sets of signals recorded as oscillations in two orthogonal directions lying in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the groove, the magnetic circuit has at least three separate polepieces providing a corresponding number of parallel paths between which paths the flux through the armature may be divided, the polepieces being so disposed with respect to the armature that the division of the flux between the paths differs for the two different directions of oscillation. Three-pole arrangement.-In the pick-up of Fig. 1 a tubular armature 10 of mild steel, which extends parallel to the surface of a record, is resiliently mounted at 11 so as to permit freedom of movement in all directions perpendicular to the groove of the record, and carries at its free end a jewel stylus 12. Damping of the armature may be effected by the rubber block 18. The three polepieces 13, 14, 15 are connected to a common magnetic yoke 16 leading to one pole of a permanent magnet 17, the other end of which is adjacent the armature 10. The armature 10 is normally equidistant from the ends of all three polepieces and lies on the straight line between the polepieces 13 and 15. For reproducing from a record having lateral cut and hill-and-dale cut signals the arrangement of coils shown in Fig. 2 is employed, coils 20 and 22 in series reproducing the former, and coil 21 the latter. For the more common 45/45 recordings the coil arrangement of Fig. 4 may be employed, coils 20 and 21 in series reproducing the RH (right-hand) signal, and coils 21 and 22 the LH signal. Although the magnetic flux can saturate the armature 10 without introducing any distortion, thus facilitating the construction of a light-weight armature assembly, it must not be allowed to saturate the polepieces. Four-pole arrangements.-Although these are not so simple to construct as the three-pole arrangement they are preferred since the latter may give rise to second harmonic distortion. In such an arrangement (Fig. 5) the poles of a first pair of polepieces 30, 31 are arranged one on each side of the armature at a level slightly below that of the armature, and those of a second pair 32, 33 slightly above, the armature normally being equidistant from all four pole-, pieces. For use with a record having lateral cut and hill-and-dale cut signals, two sets of coils 34 to 37 and 38 to 41 are provided on the four polepieces as shown in Fig. 12, the coils of each set being wound in series in such senses that the required signals are additive, and that in the set 34 to 37 the unwanted (vertical) signals are cancelled out. An arrangement of coils for reproducing from 45/45 records is shown in Fig. 11, only one coil per polepiece being required. This arrangement will also give an output from lateral cut records across the terminals RH and LH. Another embodiment is described with reference to Figs. 6 to 9 (not shown) in which the polepieces 30 to 33 do not extend in directions normal to the groove of the record, thus giving a more compact construction which provides less magnetic leakage between the pole faces.",DECCA RECORD CO LTD,COOPER PATRICK BERNARD;;HILLMAN DAVID LAWRENCE,,https://lens.org/172-464-911-542-517,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,H04R11/12,H04R11/12,H4J JDF           JDF,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Using different colour spaces for different screen areas may also reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted, for example by encoding image data more effectively and/or allowing more efficient compression of data.",DISPLAYLINK UK LTD,COOPER PATRICK;;PARKS MATTHEW;;SKINNER COLIN,DISPLAYLINK (UK) LIMITED (2020-07-23),https://lens.org/153-003-405-579-906,Granted Patent,yes,41,0,28,28,0,G06F3/013;;G09G3/002;;G09G2340/0407;;G09G2350/00;;G06F3/011;;G02B27/017;;G06F3/0484;;G09G3/02;;G09G3/2096;;H04N19/00;;G06F2203/011;;G09G2340/02;;G09G2340/06;;H04N19/63;;H04N19/117;;H04N19/14;;H04N19/186;;H04N19/154;;H04N19/17;;H04N19/167;;H04N19/59;;G02B2027/014;;G02B2027/0147;;G02B2027/0141;;G02B2027/0112;;G02B2027/0178;;G02B27/017;;H04N19/167;;H04N19/85;;H04N19/103;;H04N19/117;;H04N19/154;;H04N19/176;;G06T9/00;;G06T9/20;;H04N19/119;;H04N19/17;;H04N13/344;;G02B27/0172;;G06F3/1407;;G06F3/1423;;G06F3/147;;G09G3/2092;;G09G2300/026;;G09G2320/04;;G09G2360/04;;G06T9/00;;G06T19/006,G06T9/00;;G02B27/01;;G06F3/14;;G06F3/147;;G06T19/00;;G09G3/20;;H04N13/344,,15,0,,,"Combined Search and Examination Report for International Application No. GB1806208.3, dated Oct. 17, 2018 (6 pages).;;Combined Search and Examination Report for International Application No. GB1914690.1, dated Mar. 26, 2020 (3 pages).;;Combined Search and Examination Report for International Application No. GB1914693.5, dated Mar. 26, 2020 (3 pages).;;International Search Report for International Application No. PCT/GB2019/050044, dated May 6, 2019, (6 pages).;;XP002788904, dated Apr. 12, 2016, retrieved from internet: URL:https://web.archive.org/web/2016041219 2639/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lmage_compression [retrieved on Feb. 14, 2019] the whole document.;;Invitation to Pay Additional Fees and, Where Applicable Protest Fee from PCT/GB2019/050044, dated Mar. 11, 2019, 19 pages.;;Invitation to Pay Additional Fees and, Where Applicable Protest Fee from PCT/GB2018/053113, dated Jan. 25, 2019, 13 pages.;;International Search Report and Written Opinion from PCT/GB2018/053113, dated Mar. 20, 2019, 16 pages.;;Invitation to Pay Additional Fees and, Where Applicable Protest Fee from PCT/GB2019/050045, dated Feb. 22, 2019, 20 pages.;;International Search Report and Written Opinion from PCT/GB201 9/050045, dated Apr. 5, 2019, 28 pages.;;Combined Search and Examination Report from UK Patent Application No. GB1803339.9, dated Aug. 15, 2018, 8 pages.;;Examination Report from UK Patent Application No. GB1803339.9, dated Mar. 27, 2020, 3 pages.;;Search Report for UK Patent Application No. GB1718488.8, dated May 8, 2018, 4 pages.;;Examination Report for UK Patent Application No. GB1718488.8, dated Aug. 13, 2021, 6 pages.;;Examination Report for UK Patent Application No. GB1806208.3, dated Mar. 25, 2020, 3 pages.",ACTIVE

Each time the battery is fully discharged, any calculated charge level remaining is divided by two and subtracted from the previously calculated charge capacity. When the battery is fully charged, the charge level is set equal to the charge capacity. During subsequent charge and discharge, the current is converted to a coulomb count and added or subtracted from the charge level to maintain an accurate charge level. Fast charge inefficiency due to temperature is considered by subtracting a temperature proportional factor before the charge level of the battery is updated. The charge level, voltage and temperature are used to determine the optimal fast charge termination point to achieve full charge and prevent temperature abuse and overcharge. A fast charge is applied only if the battery is within proper voltage and temperature ranges. The charge controller includes a microcontroller circuit within the same battery pack as the battery, which is powered by the battery when AC power is unavailable. The microcontroller circuit consumes very little power, measures circuit errors to assure data accuracy, times periods of self-discharge and updates the charge level accordingly. The microcontroller circuit also includes memory to store the battery charge information and a communication port to provide the charge information to a computer system connected to the battery pack.",COMPAQ COMPUTER CORP,HESS RANDALL;;COOPER PATRICK;;INTERIANO ARMANDO;;FREIMAN JOSEPH,,https://lens.org/159-641-188-487-056,Granted Patent,no,0,0,11,11,0,G01R19/16542;;G01R31/006;;G01R31/3648;;H01M10/48;;G01R31/3842;;G01R31/3828;;Y02E60/10;;G01R31/3648;;G01R19/16542;;G01R31/006;;G01R31/3828;;H01M10/48;;G01R31/3842,G01R31/00;;G01R31/36;;H02J7/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A probe projects into the axial bore (43) from the closed end of the cylinder casing (46). There are two drive coils (40 and 41) at the distal end of the probe. The length of each drive coil (40, 41) is no greater than the space between the shorted turn coils and the adjacent end of the bore (43). Hence each drive coil (40, 41) can move into and out of mutual induction with the shorted turn coils.

Each time the battery is fully discharged, any calculated charge level remaining is divided by two and subtracted from the previously calculated charge capacity. When the battery is fully charged, the charge level is set equal to the charge capacity. During subsequent charge and discharge, the current is converted to a coulomb count and added or subtracted from the charge level to maintain an accurate charge level. Fast charge inefficiency due to temperature is considered by subtracting a temperature proportional factor before the charge level of the battery is updated. The charge level, voltage and temperature are used to determine the optimal fast charge termination point to achieve full charge and prevent temperature abuse and overcharge. A fast charge is applied only if the battery is within proper voltage and temperature ranges. The charge controller includes a microcontroller circuit within the same battery pack as the battery, which is powered by the battery when AC power is unavailable. The microcontroller circuit consumes very little power, measures circuit errors to assure data accuracy, times periods of self-discharge and updates the charge level accordingly. The microcontroller circuit also includes memory to store the battery charge information and a communication port to provide the charge information to a computer system connected to the battery pack.",COMPAQ COMPUTER CORP,HESS RANDALL;;COOPER PATRICK;;INTERIANO ARMANDO;;FREIMAN JOSEPH,,https://lens.org/037-161-234-643-106,Granted Patent,no,0,0,11,11,0,G01R19/16542;;G01R31/006;;G01R31/3648;;H01M10/48;;G01R31/3842;;G01R31/3828;;Y02E60/10;;G01R31/3648;;G01R19/16542;;G01R31/006;;G01R31/3828;;H01M10/48;;G01R31/3842,G01R31/00;;G01R31/36;;H02J7/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

If the checksum of the flash ROM contents matches an expected value, the microcontroller releases ownership of the flash ROM to the computer system so that the computer system boots-up as normal. If the microcontroller determines that the flash ROM has become corrupted, the microcontroller accesses the data port and looks for a flash programming protocol. If the protocol is present at the data port, the microcontroller receives the data from the data port and programs the flash ROM accordingly.

The charge controller includes a microcontroller circuit within the same battery pack as the battery, which is powered by the battery when AC power is unavailable. The microcontroller circuit consumes very little power, measures circuit errors to assure data accuracy, times periods of self-discharge and updates the charge level accordingly. The microcontroller circuit also includes memory to store the battery charge information and a communication port to provide the charge information to a computer system connected to the battery pack.",COMPAQ COMPUTER CORP,HESS RANDALL L;;COOPER PATRICK R;;INTERIANO ARMANDO;;FREIMAN JOSEPH F,COMPAQ COMPUTER CORPORATION A CORP.

SOLUTION: The electrically-driven tool has a leveling device 30 having a rotating member to obtain the balanced position corresponding to the level position. A rotating device has a member to allow the beam to be transmitted therethrough. An electronic circuit having an ejector, a receiver and an indicator is electrically connected so that the ejector emits the beam transmitted through a beam transmission member during the operation. The beam is received by the receiver, and the receiver then starts the indicator.

In addition, the detected orientation of the track can be compared to an expected orientation stored by a control program to avoid a loss of performance due to physical changes in the track not matching an expected/programmed configuration of the track.",ROCKWELL AUTOMATION TECH INC,VAN DORPE DAVID D;;COOPER MARK R;;RAMANARAYANAN SHANKERNARAYAN;;OZIMEK PATRICK E;;DAS JADAV,ROCKWELL AUTOMATION TECHNOLOGIES INC (2018-11-09),https://lens.org/150-981-026-055-377,Granted Patent,yes,13,3,6,6,0,G05B19/4189;;H02K41/031;;H02K11/215;;H02K11/20;;B65G54/02;;B60L13/03;;B60L2240/14;;B60L2240/16;;B60L2240/18;;B60L15/20;;B60L2240/62;;Y02T10/72;;Y02T90/16;;Y02T10/64;;H02P7/025;;H02K11/21;;B65G35/06;;H02K41/0358;;H02P29/028;;H02K11/30,H02P7/00;;B65G35/06;;H02K11/21;;H02K11/30;;H02K41/035;;H02P7/025;;H02P29/028,,1,0,,,"Extended European Search Report for EP 19208524.9; dated Mar. 30, 2020; 10 pages.",ACTIVE

    A power tool includes a leveling device which includes a rotatable member which seeks an equilibrium position which corresponds to a level position. A rotating device includes a member which enables passage of a beam. An electrical circuit which includes an emitting device, a receiving device and an indicating device is electrically coupled such that upon activation, the emitting device emits a beam which passes through the beam passing member. The beam is received by the receiving device which, in turn, activates the indicator device. The indicator is generally a light emitting device which has a varying brightness so that the user may view the indicator from all sides of the power tool.

Page description language input is converted to an intermediate display list format that is sorted into display commands associated with each strip. If during input the display list representation of the data fills the memory allotted to its storage, one or more of the strips is converted from display list format to raster format and compressed using a lossless compression algorithm. If storage of compressed strips subsequently exceeds available memory, raster data is further compressed using a lossy compression algorithm. Additional display list commands are rasterized by decompressing the compressed strips, processing the new commands and recompressing the data using lossless or lossy compression as required.

The jetting dispenser is mounted for relative motion with respect to a board. The control portion operates to command a relative motion between the dispenser and the board, and to command the dispenser to apply the dots of viscous material. The control portion operates to cause the first device to heat a nozzle(48) in response to the feedback signal greater than the amount of dots to be applied, and to cool the nozzle in response to the feedback signal less than the amount of dots to be applied.",NORDSON CORP,ABERNATHY RON;;BABIARZ ALEC J;;BARENDT NICHOLAS ANTHONY;;CIARDELLA ROBERT;;COOPER JR JAMES EVERETT;;ESPENSCHIED KENNETH S;;FISKE ERIK;;GIUSTI CHRISTOPHER L;;JENKINS PATRICK R;;LEWIS ALAN;;MERRITT RAYMOND ANDREW;;NAGANO NAOYA IAN;;QUINONES HORATIO;;RATLEDGE THOMAS;;SHERMAN JOE;;SURIAWIDJAJA FLORIANA;;WESTON TODD,,https://lens.org/094-022-568-149-850,Patent Application,no,0,5,26,28,0,B05C11/1034;;B05C11/1034;;B05C5/001;;B05C5/0225;;B05C5/0225;;B05C11/10;;B05C11/10;;G05D7/0629;;H01H85/0021;;H01H85/165;;H05K3/28;;H05K3/3485;;H05K3/3485;;H05K2203/0736,B05D1/26;;B05B12/02;;B05C5/00;;B05C5/02;;B05C9/14;;B05C11/10;;B05D3/00;;H05K3/34,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Method further include determining respective positions of the nodal points of the identical polygon shapes by placing a starting nodal point on an axis of symmetry of the planar lattice pattern and iteratively positioning each nodal point in relation to already placed neighboring nodes to make a distance between a currently positioned nodal point optimally close with a set value of the planar lattice pattern.
