The system employs a pneumatic filter cleaning device with a pneumatically driven extension guide arranged within a chamber. The guide is coupled to a first end of an extension member, which has a nozzle secured to a second end. Pressurized air provided to the nozzle through the extension member increases until a pressure at the nozzle reaches a threshold pressure level. Once the threshold pressure level is achieved, the nozzle releases a pulse or burst of air directed to a filter medium. The force from the pulsed air dislodges airborne components from the filter media, resulting in a cleaned filter.
