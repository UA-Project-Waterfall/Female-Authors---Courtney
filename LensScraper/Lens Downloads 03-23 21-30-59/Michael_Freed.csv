    A packet-forwarding device for providing policy-based services has at least a first interface, a second interface, and a packet forwarder for forwarding external packets between the first and second interfaces. The packet-forwarding device also runs internal applications that may be remotely accessed. The first and second interfaces transmit and receive internal and external packets, the internal packets being those packets generated or received by the internal applications during remote access, and the external packets being those packets destined for devices other than the packet-forwarding device. The packet forwarder forwards external packets between the first and second interfaces. An internal interface forwards internal packets between the internal applications and the first and second interfaces, and a policy engine logically connected to the internal interface applies a policy to the internal packets.

If the calculated packet arrival rate falls between the committed threshold and control rate threshold, the traffic shaper applies a link layer mechanism, such as a MAP bandwidth allocation mechanism, to lower the transmission rate from the cable modem.",3COM CORP,FREED MICHAEL;;AMARA SATISH;;BORELLA MICHAEL,HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY (2010-04-28);;3COM CORPORATION (2001-08-21);;HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT LP (2015-10-27);;HEWLETT-PACKARD DEVELOPMENT COMPANY L.P (2003-01-31);;VL IP HOLDINGS LLC (2019-12-19);;VIDEOLABS INC (2019-09-05);;VL COLLECTIVE IP LLC (2019-12-19),https://lens.org/073-981-961-942-46X,Granted Patent,yes,108,126,1,1,0,H04L47/10;;H04L47/10,H04L12/26,370/230;;370/236.1,32,10,159-460-405-593-582;;186-250-658-254-101;;021-620-896-944-88X;;147-137-417-212-315;;184-835-018-564-401;;170-291-065-930-506;;052-093-578-976-977;;014-923-580-234-229;;095-449-474-437-711;;196-624-688-410-757,10.17487/rfc1531;;10.17487/rfc0791;;10.17487/rfc0768;;10.17487/rfc1157;;10.17487/rfc1350;;10.17487/rfc2132;;10.1109/35.372194;;10.1109/icassp.1995.480107;;10.1109/icccn.1997.623330;;10.17487/rfc2481,"Droms, R., Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, Request for Comments 1541, Oct. 1993, pp. 1 to 31.;;RFC 791, Internet Protocol, DARPA Internet Program Protocol Specification, Sep. 1981, pp. 1-37.;;Postel, J., Internet Protocol, DARPA Internet Program Protocol Specification, RFC 792, Sep. 1981, pp. 1-14.;;Postel, J., User Datagram Protocol, RFC 768, Aug. 28, 1980, pp. 1-3.;;RFC 793, Transmission Control Protocol, DARPA Internet Program Protocol Specification, Sep. 1981, pp. 1-68.;;Case, J. et al., A Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), RFC 1157, May 1990, pp. 1-26.;;Sollins, K., The TFTP Protocol (Revision 2), RFC 1350, Jul. 1992, pp. 1-9.;;Alexander, S., DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions, RFC 2132, Mar. 1997, pp. 1-37.;;""Radio Frequency Interface Specification (Interim Specification) SP-RFIv1.1-103-991105"", MCNS Holdings, L.P., 1999, pp. Ii to 366.;;""Cable Modem to Customer Premise Equipment Interface Specification (Interim) SP-CMCI-I02-980317"", Multimedia Cable Network Systems (MCNS) Holdings, L.P., Cable Television Laboratories, Inc., 1998, pp. ii to 40.;;""Operations Support System Interface Specification Baseline Privacy Interface MIB (Interim Specification) SP-OSSI-BPI-I01-980331"", MCNS Holdings, L.P., 1997 and 1998, pp. ii to 33.;;""Cable Modem Termination System-Network Side Interface Specification (Interim Specification) SP-CMTS-NSII01-960702"", MCNS Holdings, L.P., 1996, pp. ii to 13.;;""Removable Security Module Interface Specification (Interim Specification) SP-RSMI-I01-980204"", MCNS Holdings, L.P., Cable Television Laboratories, Inc., 1997, pp. ii to 47.;;""Baseline Privacy Interface Specification (Interim) SP-BPI-[01-970922"", MCNS Holdings, L.P., 1997, pp. ii to 65.;;""Operations Support System Interface Specification (Interim) SP-OSSII01-970403"", MCNS Holdings, L.P., 1997, pp. 1 to 30.;;""Radio Frequency Interface Specification (Interim Specification) SP-RFI-102-971008"", MCNS Holdings, L.P., 1997, pp. ii to 186.;;""Cable Modem Telephony Return Interface Specification (Interim) SP-CMTRI-I01-970804"", MCNS Holdings, L.P., Cable Television Laboratories, Inc., 1997, pp. ii to 73.;;""Security System Specification (Interim Sepcification) SP-SSI-I01-970506"", MCNS Holdings, L.P., 1997, pp. ii to 103.;;""Internet Engineering Task Force"", Request for Comments 2131, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Mar. 1997, pp. 1 to 42.;;S.

For example, an apparatus, such as a router, responds to all network connection request packets received from a client for all ports on an attached server as if all of the server's ports are open. Once a network connection is established between the router and the client, a network connection request is transmitted to the server for a requested port. Using the router to establish a full network connection with the client eliminates a unscrupulous client from sending numerous decoy network connection request messages in an effort to hide the identity of the client. By responding to all network connection requests by establishing a TCP full connection before a network connection request is forwarded to a server, a client receives no useful information regarding the state of a port on the server before providing a valid and detectable IP address. Stealth port scanning is rendered ineffective. Only connect scan-type port scanning, which is both detectible and defendable, may be used to identify open ports on a server.",JUNIPER NETWORKS INC,FREED MICHAEL;;KROHN ROBERT M,JUNIPER NETWORKS INC (2004-05-03),https://lens.org/193-998-496-724-96X,Granted Patent,yes,20,50,1,1,0,H04L63/1466;;H04L69/16;;H04L69/163;;H04L63/1466;;H04L69/163;;H04L69/16,G06F9/00;;G06F15/173;;G06F11/00;;G06F12/14;;G06F12/16;;G06F15/16;;G06F17/00;;G08B23/00,709/225;;726/12;;726/23,10,0,,,"""Well-Known TCP Port Number,"" www.webopedia.com, 3 pages.;;""TCP Packet Field Descriptions,"" www.ipanalyser.co.uk, Analyser Sales Ltd., Copyright 2003, 2 pages.;;Michael Egan, ""Decomposition of a TCP Packet,"" www.passwall.com, 4 pages, Aug. 7, 2000.;;Mark Gibbs, ""A Guide to Original SYN,"" www.nwfusion.com, Network World, Nov. 2000, 2 pages.;;Michael Egan, ""Sample TCP/IP Packet,"" www.passwall.com, Version 0.0.0 @ 03:55/Aug. 7, 2000, Copyright 2002, 9 pages.;;D.J.

The system controls the fluid pressure in a high pressure reservoir, and/or in a vacuum reservoir, based on the results of the comparison. If the actual time for inflation is too short compared to the target time, the fluid pressure in the high pressure reservoir is reduced. If the actual time for inflation is too long compared with the target time, the fluid pressure in the high pressure reservoir is increased. If the actual time for deflation is too short compared to the target time, the vacuum in the vacuum reservoir is decreased.

The method and device provide an effective and non-invasive treatment for these disorders which is substantially more effective than traditional treatment methods, such as thermal stimulation. The method and device also effectively treat worst-case dysphagia (the inability to swallow) resulting from neurodegeneration and strokes. The device, an electrical pharyngeal neuromuscular stimulator, includes one or more pulse generators for generating a series of electrical pulses and a processor coupled to the pulse generators for controlling their operation. A switching network is also coupled to the pulse generators. The switching network directs series of electrical pulses respectively generated by the pulse generators to an electrode array positioned on the tissue of a patient's pharyngeal region. The processor controls the switching operation of the switching network by determining which electrode in the electrode array receives the series of pulses generated by the respective pulse generators. The electrode array also generates electrical feedback signals in response to the neuromuscular stimulation of the patient.

Oropharyngeal disorders may cause an inability to swallow or difficulty in swallowing. The method and device provide an effective and non-invasive treatment for these disorders which is substantially more effective than traditional treatment methods, such as thermal stimulation. The method and device also effectively treat worst-case dysphagia (the inability to swallow) resulting form neurodegeneration and strokes. The device, an electrical pharyngeal neuromuscular stimulator, includes one or more pulse generators for generating a series of electrical pulses and a processor coupled to the pulse generators for controlling their operation. A switching network is also coupled to the pulse generators. The switching network directs series of electrical pulses respectively generated by the pulse generators to an electrode array positioned on the tissue of a patient's pharyngeal region. The processor controls the switching operation of the switching network by determining which electrode in the electrode array receives the series of pulses generated by the respective pulse generators. The electrode array also generates electrical feedback signals in response to the neuromuscular stimulation of the patient. The electrical feedback signals are provided to the processor via the switching network. The processor generates and stores test data and modifies the operation control signals and switching control signals in response to the electrical feedback signals.",ESD LLC,FREED MARCY L;;FREED LEONARD A;;CHRISTIAN MICHAEL O;;TUCKER HOWARD;;KOTTON BERNARD;;BEYTAS EROL M;;ASMAR MARIE,,https://lens.org/019-043-314-159-285,Patent Application,yes,5,5,3,3,0,A61N1/36007;;A61N1/3601;;A61N1/3605;;A61N1/3605;;A61N1/3601;;A61N1/36007,A61N1/36;;A61N1/32,,1,0,,,"DATABASE WPI Section PQ Week 9235, Derwent World Patents Index; Class P34, AN 92-291537, XP002090877",PENDING

   A method and system for implementing policy by accumulating policies for a policy recipient from policy objects associated with a hierarchically organized structure of containers, such as directory containers (sites, domains and organizational units) that includes the policy recipient. Based on administrator input, policy settings for the policy recipient may be accumulated into a specific order by inheriting policy from higher containers, which may enforce their policy settings over those of lower containers. Policy that is not enforced may be blocked at a container. The result is an accumulated set of group policy objects that are ordered by relative strength to resolve any policy conflicts. Policy may be applied to a policy recipient by calling extensions, such as an extension that layers the policy settings into the registry or an extension that uses policy information from the objects according to the ordering thereof. Linking of group policy objects to one or more containers (e.g., sites, domains and organizational units) is provided, as is exception management.

Based on administrator input, policy settings for the policy recipient may be accumulated into a specific order by inheriting policy from higher containers, which may enforce their policy settings over those of lower containers. Policy that is not enforced may be blocked at a container. The result is an accumulated set of group policy objects that are ordered by relative strength to resolve any policy conflicts. Policy may be applied to a policy recipient by calling extensions, such as an extension that layers the policy settings into the registry or an extension that uses policy information from the objects according to the ordering thereof. Linking of group policy objects to one or more containers (e.g., sites, domains and organizational units) is provided, as is exception management. The effects of group policy may be filtered based on users' or computers' membership in security groups.
