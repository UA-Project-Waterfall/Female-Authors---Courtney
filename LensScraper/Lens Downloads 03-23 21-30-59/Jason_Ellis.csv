The energizing signal is coupled to the sensor via magnetic coupling and induces a current in the sensor which oscillates at the resonant frequency of the sensor.

The locking mechanism also does not require the coupling components to overtravel during connection. Such advantages are accomplished using a reduction of design complexity over conventional configurations in the use of a single sleeve spring in the locking mechanism, and the use of smaller restriction slots to house axially offset locking balls in a manner that axially constrains movement of the locking balls. When a male component is inserted into the female component during a connection operation, a shoulder on the male component sequentially contacts the axially offset rows of locking balls, which drive the inner sleeve axially in an inward direction. In the fully connected state, the inner sleeve is biased axially outward so as to push back against the inward locking balls, thereby preventing further movement of the inward locking balls.",PARKER HANNIFIN CORP,NICK LEONARD;;KOLLER JASON;;MARQUIS TIMOTHY;;ELLIS SHAWN;;LEMAY PAUL,PARKER-HANNIFIN CORPORATION (2020-11-02);;PARKER INTANGIBLES LLC (2023-07-10),https://lens.org/173-026-567-590-208,Patent Application,yes,0,5,3,3,0,F16L37/23;;F16L37/23;;F16L37/34,F16L37/23;;F16L37/34,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The locking mechanism also does not require the coupling components 12, 42 to overtravel during connection. Such advantages are accomplished using a reduction of design complexity over conventional configurations in the use of a single sleeve spring 40 in the locking mechanism, and the use of smaller restriction slots to house axially offset locking balls 30, 34 in a manner that axially constrains movement of the locking balls. When a male 43 component is inserted into the female component 12 during a connection operation, a shoulder 59 on the male component sequentially contacts the axially offset rows of locking balls 30, 34, which drive the inner sleeve 36 axially in an inward direction. In the fully connected state, the inner sleeve 36 is biased axially outward so as to push back against the inward locking balls 30, 34, thereby preventing further movement of the inward locking balls.

A USB hub provides a wired connection to the host, while providing wireless attachment points for its devices. The USB host periodically queries the hub looking for changes in the hub's status register. During each period, the hub sends a polling message through each of its wireless ports, and awaits a response. A peripheral device that wishes to attach to the system responds to the message by sending its unique peripheral address. If a device currently occupies the port, the hub sends out the device's unique assigned address as part of the polling message.If the device is still present, it responds by sending its unique peripheral address. If the host does not receive a response after multiple retries, the device is considered detached. The hub thus determines the status of the ports and updates the appropriate bits in the status register, which is the queried by the host.",GEN ATOMICS,GEHRING STEPHAN WALTER;;PETERS DANIEL PAUL;;ELLIS JASON LEE;;ANANTHAKRISHNAN SATISH,,https://lens.org/082-875-049-392-444,Granted Patent,no,0,0,5,10,0,G06F13/387;;G06F2213/3814;;G06F2213/4002,G06F13/38,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A hub provides a wired connection to the host and wireless attachment points for its devices. The host periodically queries the hub for changes in the hub's status register by sending a polling message through each of its wireless ports, and awaits a response. A peripheral device that wishes to attach to the system responds by sending its unique peripheral address. If a device currently occupies the port, the hub sends out the device's unique address in the polling message. If the device is still present, it responds by sending its unique peripheral address. If a response is not received after multiple retries, the device is considered detached.

A current value of the demand response parameter is compared to the threshold value, and a determination is made whether or not to call a demand response event for the current opportunity, or to save the event for a future opportunity based on this comparison. <P>COPYRIGHT: (C)2011,JPO&INPIT",GEN ELECTRIC,TYAGI RAJESH;;BLACK JASON WAYNE;;ELLIS JOHN ANDREW;;THOMAS BEX GEORGE,,https://lens.org/132-487-484-715-487,Patent Application,no,3,3,13,13,0,G06Q10/04;;G06Q10/06315;;G06Q10/06312;;G06Q10/06313;;H02J2203/20;;Y02E60/00;;Y04S40/20;;H02J2310/58;;H02J3/144;;Y04S20/222;;Y02B70/3225;;G06Q10/06312;;G06Q10/06313;;G06Q10/04;;G06Q10/06315;;H02J2203/20;;Y02E60/00;;Y04S40/20;;H02J3/144,G06Q50/00;;G06Q10/00,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

A USB hub provides a wired connection to the host, while providing wireless attachment points for its devices. The USB host periodically queries the hub looking for changes in the hub's status register. During each period, the hub sends a polling message through each of its wireless ports, and awaits a response. A peripheral device that wishes to attach to the system responds to the message by sending its unique peripheral address.

The hub thus determines the status of the ports and updates the appropriate bits in the status register, which is then queried by the host.

A current value of the demand response parameter is compared to the threshold value, and a determination is made whether or not to call a demand response event for the current opportunity, or to save the event for a future opportunity based upon this comparison.",GEN ELECTRIC,TYAGI RAJESH;;BLACK JASON WAYNE;;ELLIS JOHN ANDREW;;THOMAS BEX GEORGE,GE DIGITAL HOLDINGS LLC (2023-11-10);;GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY (2009-12-22),https://lens.org/176-649-118-980-753,Patent Application,yes,9,54,13,13,0,G06Q10/04;;G06Q10/06315;;G06Q10/06312;;G06Q10/06313;;H02J2203/20;;Y02E60/00;;Y04S40/20;;H02J2310/58;;H02J3/144;;Y04S20/222;;Y02B70/3225;;G06Q10/06312;;G06Q10/06313;;G06Q10/04;;G06Q10/06315;;H02J2203/20;;Y02E60/00;;Y04S40/20;;H02J3/144,G06F1/26;;G06Q10/00;;G06Q50/00,700/291;;700/295;;700/297;;705/7.25,3,0,,,"Ericson Torgeir, Hosehold self-election of a dynamic electricity tariff, Discussion Papers 446, Statistics Norway Research Department, 2006;;Hull John C, Options, Futures and Other Derivatives 6th Edition, ISBN 0121499084,2006;;Definition of a Normal distribution function as an exemplary Probability Distribution functionhttp://math.elon.edu/statistics112/norm_dist.html",ACTIVE

   A method and system for controlling bandwidth used to communicate between at least one client and a server. A history is accessed that includes information about communications between the at least one client and a server during a period of time. The history is employed to determine a send time at which a message could be sent without exceeding a bandwidth threshold. The bandwidth threshold indicates an upper limit for an amount of bandwidth allowed during a period of time to communicate between the at least one client and the server. A data structure is then modified to delay sending the message until at least the send time.

The disclosed method provides improved response to power imbalance based on a communications signal independent of system frequency. The communication signal provides a feed-forward control of dispatchable power resources. A communications network is employed to generate a signal to dispatchable resources that a power imbalance has occurred. Due to fast response power transmission network interfaces associated with the dispatchable resources, the respective resources respond in significantly less time than feedback controlled conventional generators which depend on line frequency sensing. The rapid response mitigates the impact of power imbalances and enables greater penetrations of converter-interfaced power generation units such as renewable energy sources to be connected to the grid.",NAT TECH & ENG SOLUTIONS SANDIA LLC,WILCHES BERNAL FELIPE;;NEELY JASON C;;CONCEPCION RICKY JAMES;;BYRNE RAYMOND H;;ELLIS ABRAHAM,NATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS OF SANDIA LLC (2018-01-15),https://lens.org/174-013-737-799-033,Granted Patent,yes,4,2,1,1,0,G05B15/02;;H02J3/28;;H02J3/28;;H02J3/24;;Y02E70/30,G05B15/02;;H02J3/28,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

   A method and system for versioning of applications is provided. A version of an application may be updated or rolled back transparently to the client. A list of resources in a current version of an application is created and compared to the list of resources in a new version. When a resource is not included in the current version but is included in the new version, a notation is made to include the resource in the new version. When an extra resource is in the current version but not in the new version, a notation is made to purge the resource so that it is not included in the new version. These notations may be created in a purge list used by the client to request the resources needed to change versions. No interaction is needed by the client to change versions.

An analyzer may also be used to simulate the system and adjust parameters used in creating the prediction graph.",VALVE CORP,JONES PAUL DAVID;;NEWCOMBE CHRISTOPHER RICHARD;;ELLIS RICHARD DONALD;;BIRUM DERRICK JASON;;THOMPSON MIKEL HOWARD,VALVE CORPORATION (2003-05-07),https://lens.org/119-247-879-160-021,Granted Patent,yes,111,63,14,45,0,H04L61/2514;;H04L63/0428;;H04L63/08;;H04L63/0807;;H04L63/0846;;H04L63/123;;H04L63/168;;H04L2463/101;;H04L2463/121;;H04L67/06;;H04L67/1008;;H04L67/34;;H04L67/306;;H04L67/02;;H04L67/289;;H04L69/329;;H04L67/53;;H04L67/1001;;H04L67/564;;H04L67/51;;H04L67/5681;;H04L67/55;;H04L67/62;;G06F15/16;;G06F17/00;;H04L41/0896;;H04L63/0428;;H04L63/0846;;H04L63/0807;;H04L2463/121;;H04L61/2514;;H04L63/08;;H04L63/168;;H04L63/123;;H04L2463/101;;H04L69/329;;H04L67/34;;H04L67/02;;H04L67/06;;H04L67/306;;H04L67/289;;H04L67/1008;;H04L9/40;;H04L67/01;;H04L67/51;;H04L67/53;;H04L67/55;;H04L67/62;;H04L67/1001;;H04L67/5681;;H04L67/564,G06F15/16;;H04L12/24;;H04L12/56;;H04L29/06;;H04L29/08;;H04L29/12,709/203;;709/219;;709/232;;711/137;;711/158;;707/3,14,3,038-532-724-692-062;;058-512-221-437-534;;088-808-184-305-639,10.1109/69.204097;;10.1145/253452.253474;;10.1109/32.48942,"Rajiv Jauhari et al., ""Priority-Hints: An Algorithm for Priority-Based Buffer Management"".

   A method and system for effectively communicating file properties and directory structures within a distributed file system is provided. A manifest that includes properties relating to all of the files used in an application is created. The manifest is distributed to a client before the client has received all of the files or properties associated with an application. The manifest is stored on the client and is used to determine properties and locations of files used within the application. A distributed file system layer is used to receive file and property requests from the application; determine the location of the requested file, or the property using the manifest, and retrieve the property or file using the manifest. A tool may be used to generate the manifest manually or automatically. File system calls within an application may be replaced with calls that use the distributed file system layer. An interpreter may also be used to intercept the file system calls and replace them with calls that use the distributed file system layer.

   A method and system for preloading data is provided. Resources are preloaded on a client before they are needed by an application. Application hints and static resources lists may be used to indicate resources are needed. The application may begin execution before receiving all of the resources associated with the application. Preloading may be done during execution of an application, or when the application is not executing. Preloading allows an application to run smoothly without consuming more resources than are needed by an application. A prediction graph may be generated that is used in predicting the resources that are likely to be needed by the application. An analyzer may also be used to simulate the system and adjust parameters used in creating the prediction graph.

The hydrogen storage powder exhibits improved chemcial homogeneity as a result of rapid solidfication from the melt and small particle size that is more resistant to microcracking during hydrogen absorption/desorption cycling. A hydrogen storage component, such as an electrode for a battery or electrochemical fuel cell, made from the gas atomized hydrogen storage material is resistant to hydrogen degradation upon hydrogen absorption/desorption that occurs for example, during charging/discharging of a battery. Such hydrogen storage components can be made by consolidating and optionally sintering the gas atomized hydrogen storage powder or alternately by shaping the gas atomized powder and a suitable binder to a desired configuration in a mold or die.",UNIV IOWA STATE RES FOUND INC;;CALIFORNIA INST OF TECHN,ANDERSON IVER E;;ELLIS TIMOTHY W;;PECHARSKY VITALIJ K;;TING JASON;;TERPSTRA ROBERT;;BOWMAN ROBERT C;;WITHAM CHARLES K;;FULTZ BRENT T;;BUGGA RATNAKUMAR V,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (2000-02-14);;IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FOUNDATION INC (1998-05-29),https://lens.org/041-164-591-984-628,Granted Patent,yes,7,31,1,1,0,B22F9/082;;B22F2998/00;;B22F2998/10;;C01B3/0047;;C01B3/0057;;C01B3/0084;;C22C1/0441;;H01M4/383;;H01M4/626;;H01M8/065;;H01M10/345;;Y10S420/90;;Y02E60/32;;Y02P70/50;;Y02E60/50;;Y02E60/10;;B22F9/082;;H01M10/345;;B22F2998/00;;C01B3/0057;;C22C1/0441;;H01M4/383;;B22F2998/10;;H01M4/626;;H01M8/065;;C01B3/0047;;C01B3/0084;;Y10S420/90;;Y02E60/32;;Y02P70/50,B22F9/08;;C01B3/00;;C22C1/04;;H01M4/38;;H01M4/62;;H01M8/06;;H01M10/34,75/245;;75/252;;75/338;;420/900;;429/209;;419/31;;419/62;;148/513,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
