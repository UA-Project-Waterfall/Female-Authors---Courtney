The present invention utilizes three cycles of operation. The first cycle provides power into the primary coil. The second cycle opens contacts allowing the primary coil to generate BEMF oscillations. Both the positive and negative BEMF pulses from the primary are collected and stored in capacitors. The positive pulses are stored in a smaller capacitor. Also during the second cycle, the secondary coils and associated circuitry collect both the positive and negative pulses from the etheric oscillations, which occur due to the BEMF ringing of the primary magnetic field returning to the zero state. The third operation occurs, when the second set of contacts close and a capacitive discharge pulse recharges the primary battery back to its normal operating level.

The improved multilevel FSK demodulator uses controllable time-delay in the demodulation process. This method requires a 90° phase difference between 2 modulated signals to produce a maximum demodulated output amplitude at the maximum frequency deviation. Since the IF frequencies have been down-converted back to baseband quadrature, these 2 signals are only ""out of phase"" by an amount Δt that is equal to 90°/dω.

The improved multilevel FSK demodulator uses controllable time-delay in the demodulation process. This method requires a 90° phase difference between 2 modulated signals to produce a maximum demodulated output amplitude at the maximum frequency deviation. Since the IF frequencies have been down-converted back to baseband quadrature, these 2 signals are only ""out of phase"" by an amount Δt that is equal to 90°/dω. A further aspect of this invention addresses minimizing the DC offset from the demodulator by providing a feedback signal which controls the amount of delay provided to one of the quadrature signals.

A load sense line is utilized to sense the pressure of the fluid in each hydraulic actuator and to apply a total load sense signal to the control system. A conduit containing a pressure reducing valve provides fluid communication between the output of the source of fluid and the load sense line to pass fluid therethrough to the load sense line only when the pressure in the load sense line is less than a predetermined value. Maintaining at least this minimum pressure in the load sense line minimizes lag in the load sense signal which would otherwise occur as a result of the loss of fluid in the load sense line due to the bleeding of the load sense line.",VOSS DENNIS A,VOSS DENNIS A;;GRUBER GARY A,,https://lens.org/085-370-533-156-051,Patent Application,no,0,0,2,2,0,E02F9/2221;;E02F9/2221;;E02F9/2232;;E02F9/2232;;F15B11/163;;F15B11/163;;F15B11/165;;F15B11/165;;F15B2211/20553;;F15B2211/20553;;F15B2211/253;;F15B2211/253;;F15B2211/30555;;F15B2211/30555;;F15B2211/3111;;F15B2211/3111;;F15B2211/324;;F15B2211/324;;F15B2211/351;;F15B2211/351;;F15B2211/50536;;F15B2211/50536;;F15B2211/55;;F15B2211/55;;F15B2211/6052;;F15B2211/6052;;F15B2211/6055;;F15B2211/6055;;F15B2211/6058;;F15B2211/6058;;F15B2211/7053;;F15B2211/7053;;F15B2211/71;;F15B2211/71,E02F9/22;;F15B11/16,D31380073    M,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The HDD may be included in a digital host communications terminal (DHCT). Initially, the PLSB buffers initial streaming programs to accommodate for channel changes. Additionally, the streaming program is buffered in a standard definition quality regardless of the format of a connected television. Once a predetermined time has passed determined by the size of the PLSB without a channel change, the TSB begins buffering the streaming program.

    A process for treating a light cracked naphtha to be used as an etherification feed stock is disclosed in which mercaptans, H ₂ S and diolefins are removed simultaneously in a distillation column reactor using a reduced nickel catalyst. The mercaptans and H ₂ S are reacted with the diolefins to form sulfides which are higher boiling than that portion of the naphtha which is used as feed to the etherification unit. The higher boiling sulfides are removed as bottoms along with any C ₆ and heavier materials. Any diolefins not converted to sulfides are selectively hydrogenated to mono-olefins for use in the etherification process.

The source plastic (31) may include mixed residual classes of recyclable plastic, including thermosetting plastics and other plastics having little to no widespread utility. The paving material (10) produces roadbeds (12) of higher strength and durability, requiring less total asphalt thickness and providing greater water impermeability. The recycled plastic component (31) of the material is a mixture of any and all recyclable classes 3 through 7, or of those materials from such classes remaining after potentially more valuable recyclable materials may have been selectively removed. The paving product (10) is preferably formed by a process of shredding or mechanically granulating used and industrial waste plastic to a no.4 to 1/2 inch sieve size, and to 1/4 inch to 3/8 inch granules. The Plastic may be cooled during the granulating process. The granules are then treated with an energized activating medium, a plasma formed in preferably argon or some other plasma enhancing gas (93), to activate the surface of the granules, without burning or melting the plastic- Humidity free gas, from a dehumidifier (79) or other source, fills voids in the particle mass fed to an input hopper (82) or otherwise to the top of a vertical plasma column (81) having the argon flowing upwardly therethrough. A replaceable plastic liner (98) protects the column walls from deposits. Gas bursts prevent clogging of the particles in the column. The activated treated granules are added to the aggregate then mixed with the asphalt binder to produce the paving meterial. A slurry or sands mix of plastic and binder may also be applied over an aggregate layer, base layer or roadbed.",PLASPHALT PROJECT LTD CO;;STELMAR HELEN A,FISHBACK GARY M;;EGAN DENNIS E;;STELMAR HILARY,,https://lens.org/169-146-121-653-181,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,3,0,C08L95/00;;C08L2207/20;;C08L2207/24;;E01C7/265,C08L95/00;;E01C7/26,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    The present invention is an apparatus and method pertaining the food patty production. The present invention allows high output production of food product patties at reduced machine operating speeds. This is accomplished by effectively utilizing a mold plate with multiple rows of patty cavities. Thus, more patties can be molded at slower operating speeds. This aspect of the present invention reduces normal wear and tear on machines resulting in high efficiency output. The present invention operated at reciprocating frequencies lower than those used in machines known in the industry can potentially increase output by two-fold, or more. The present invention is also designed to produce patties of uniform size, weight and texture thereby promoting consistent cooking and food safety. This is accomplished by a (1) specified operation timing sequence and (2) custom designed fill slots which serve as a conduit between a food product source and a patty cavity. The apparatus is adaptable for use in standard food patty molding machines.

The paving material includes any and all residual classes of recyclable plastic, including thermosetting plastics and other plastics having little to no current widespread utility. The material produces roadbeds of higher strength with less total asphalt thickness and having greater water impermeability, and is most useful for all layers below the surface layer. The recyclable plastic component of the material is preferably a mixture of all recyclable classes 3 through 7, or of those materials from such classes from which potentially more valuable recyclable materials have been selectively removed. The paving product is preferably formed by a process of shredding or mechanically granulating used and industrial waste plastic to a no. 4 to 1/2 inch sieve size, and preferably to 1/4 inch to 3/8 inch granules. The granules are then treated with a reducing flame, with a plasma flame process, to activate the surface of the granules and increase the surface tension without raising the temperature of the plastic.

    An airbag module assembly 10  contains a module housing 12  closed by an airbag module door assembly 15.  A panel 16  forms an airbag module door for release of an airbag 14  upon activation of module assembly 10.  Attachment members 28  and 30  are connected to opposing peripheral edges 20  and 22  of the panel 16.  In another aspect, a tear seam 46  may be incorporated on an attachment member 30  adjacent the peripheral edge 22  of the door 16,  rather than on the panel 16.  By providing upwardly angled slots 48  within the attachment member 30  and adjacent the edge 22,  that converge toward the edge 42  and interface with corresponding instrument panel arms 52  protruding from the vehicle structure 18.  The combination therefore provides enhanced leverage for a smooth tear along the attachment member 30  and a smooth deployment of the airbag 14.  The tear seam 46  need not therefore be conventionally formed within the panel 16.

The mercaptans and H _{ 2 } S are reacted with the diolefins to form sulfides which are higher boiling than that portion of the naphtha which is used as feed to the etherification unit. The higher boiling sulfides are removed as bottoms along with any C _{ 6 } and heavier materials. Any diolefins not converted to sulfides are selectively hydrogenated to mono-olefins for use in the etherification process.

The display module is readily adjusted in tilt angle, whether attached or remoted. A front frame (14) with a recess (16) is mounted on the front of a main chassis for the instrument. Latches (20) are mounted on the main chassis and extend into the recess on opposing sides of the recess, the ends of the latches defining a rotation axis across the recess. A display module has clutch assemblies (44) frictionally, rotatably mounted on opposing sides to fixedly engage the ends of the latches when the display module is mounted within the recess. Release of one latch allows the display module to be removed and set up independently with a stand (48) integral with the clutch assemblies, the display module being electrically connected to the electrical instrument by an electrical cable (36) of suitable length. The integral stand provides a means for remotely setting up the display module at any desirable viewing angle when remoted. Thus the tilt of the display module may be adjusted while the display module either is mounted within the instrument or is remoted from the instrument.

A liquid is suspended by a wettable material (24) adjacent to the interior surface of the second chamber. This liquid undergoes a phase change into a vapor which cools the outer surface (26) of the device. The vapor is allowed to flow out of the second chamber (18) and into the first chamber (12), which contains a sorbent (14) for the vapor. The device is self-contained, because a material (16) in contact with the sorbent removes the heat from the sorbent to prevent a reduction in the cooling effect produced by the vaporizing liquid. In addition, a vaccum is created within the second chamber (18) which insulates the first chamber (12) and keeps the heated sorbent (14) from diminishing that cooling effect.",INT THERMAL PACKAGING INC,STEIDL GARY V;;SABIN CULLEN N;;THOMAS DENNIS A,,https://lens.org/190-918-966-244-10X,Patent Application,yes,4,10,2,2,0,F25B17/08;;F25D2400/28,F25B17/08,,0,0,,,,PENDING
