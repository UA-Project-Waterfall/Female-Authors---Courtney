The system includes an elongated suction tube including an interior passage extending between an open proximal end and an open distal end. The suction tube includes an elongated main body portion disposed between the open distal end and a forward end of an enhanced diameter collection cavity. The cross-sectional area of the interior passage varies along the length of the suction tube and is greater within the collection cavity than within the main body portion. The total internal volume of the collection cavity may exceed the volume necessary to contain the abnormality.,DOAN NINH BA,DOAN NINH BA,,https://lens.org/196-635-546-839-797,Patent Application,yes,5,0,2,2,0,A61M25/0102;;A61B17/00234;;A61B2017/22079;;A61B17/3415;;A61B90/10;;A61B17/3421;;A61M2210/0693;;A61B2017/22079;;A61B17/00234,A61B17/34,,0,0,,,,PENDING
