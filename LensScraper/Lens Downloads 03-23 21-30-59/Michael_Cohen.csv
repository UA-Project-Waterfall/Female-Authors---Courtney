Testing for faults. FORTIPHONE, Ltd. Sept. 25,1952 [Oct. 3, 1951], No. 23049/51. Class 37 A coil to be tested for short-circuited turns and number of turns is linked with the field threading a pair of coils in a magnetic bridge, which coils are coupled to a local oscillator, the signals :from the pair of coils being rectified and fed to a D.C. bridge circuit. A magnetic core 1 carries three coils 2, 3, 4 forming a magnetic bridge. The central coil 2 is fed from a local oscillator 5, and the coils 3, 4 are connected together and earthed at their junction. The coils 3, 4 are connected to similar valve amplifiers 6, 7 followed by rectifiers 9, 10. The rectified outputs are passed to a D.C. bridge balance circuit 11, the output of which is fed to an indicating meter 12. The apparatus is first balanced, so that the indicator 12 reads zero. A coil 15 to be tested is then slipped over one end of the core 1 and an indication is given if the coil contains short-circuited turns. The magnetic bridge portion 1, 2, 3, 4 is preferably made as a separate unit enclosed in a casing from which projects the end of the core over which coils 15 are to be placed for testing. This unit is made with plug-in terminals so that it can be plugged into a second unit containing the parts 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12. To test a coil for correct number of turns the apparatus is given a predetermined degree of unbalance, and the coil to be tested is shortcircuited and placed over the end of the core. Balance is restored if the number of turns is correct. The predetermined degree of unbalance may be introduced by means of an adjustable attenuator in the output circuit of one of the coils 3, 4. Alternatively, a standard coil of the correct number of turns is shortcircuited and placed on one end of the core. The coil to be tested is shortcircuited and placed on the other end of the core. Balance is restored if the number of turns is correct. Instead of a straight core in the magnetic bridge, a T-shaped core may be employed, the central limb carrying the coil 2.",FORTIPHONE LTD,COHEN MICHAEL,,https://lens.org/150-710-981-927-124,Granted Patent,no,0,3,1,1,0,G01R29/20;;G01R31/72;;G01R31/72,G01R31/72,G1U UC4A1         UC4A1;;G1U UJB9A         UJB9A;;G1U U11A2         NB;;G1U U11EX         NB;;G1U U11E2         NB;;G1U U12A1C        PB;;G1U U12B3         PB;;G1U U12CX         PB;;G1U U12C4         PB,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

ARDENTE ACOUSTIC LABORATORIES Ltd. Nov. 9, 1959 [Nov. 12, 1958], No. 36377/58. Class 40 (4). A hearing aid of the air conduction type has a receiver disposedin a first casing and a microphone disposed in a second casing, components in the two casings being electrically connected together by flexible conductors and the casings being mechanically connected together via compliable spacer means. The distance between two casing parts coupled together by the compliable spacer means is less than the dimensions of the compliable spacer means in directions transverse to said distance. Supported on the ear alone.-The receiver casing 1, Figs. 1, 2, is in two parts 5, 6 and encloses a volume control 11, Fig. 14, an on-off and tone control switch 14, a transistor amplifier 83 and a pivotally mounted holder 13 for a mercury cell. A tube 3 connects a receiver 95 to an earplug 4. Contacts of the switch 14 are printed on the face of a sheet 85 of rigid insulating material. The microphone casing 2, Figs. 12, 13, is a lidless rectangular box having a rectangular hole 71 in its base. The edges of the hole 71 are rabbeted to accommodate a baffle plate 77. The microphone is in a brass housing 78 to which the first stage 79 of a transistor amplifier is attached. The structure for coupling the casings 1, 2 together includes a first coupling member 100, Figs. 15, 16, having a plate portion 102 with two arms 103 bent in one direction from opposite sides and two lugs 104 bent in the opposite direction from opposite ends, the lugs being formed with screw-threaded holes 105. A second coupling member 101, Figs. 17, 18, consists of a rectangular plate 107 having its two ends bent over to form flanges 108 having screw-threaded holes 109. There are also three rectangular sheets of foamed plastic or foamed rubber which comprise the compliable spacer means. The first sheet 115, Fig. 14, is cemented to the portion 102 of member 100. The second sheet 116, Fig. 19, is cemented to portion 102 with the arms 103 piercing the sheet 116. The third sheet 117 is cemented to plate 107 of member 101 between the flanges 108. In assembling the members, the exposed face of plate 107 is placed on the exposed face of sheet 116 and the ends 106 of arms 103 are bent around the sides of the plate 107 and the ends of the sheet 117. The sheets 115 to 117 and members 100, 101 are centrally pierced for the passage of flexible conductors. Screws passing into the holes 109 in the flanges 108 secure the compliable spacer means to the cover 6. The lugs 104 fit into recesses in the casing 2 and fixing screws pass through holes 80 into the holes 105 in the lugs 104. An alternative casing 2, Fig. 22, has a small hole 120 where the base 70 meets the wall 74. In an alternative arrangement, Fig. 26, casing 130 holds a receiver 126, casing 132 holds a microphone 129 and middle casing 131 contains a mercury cell 127 and other components 124. Adjacent casings are coupled by compliable spacer means. In a further embodiment an earplug 131 is formed with a cup-shaped recess 132 to receive a casing 133 which houses a receiver. Casing 133 is coupled by a rubber link or other compliable coupling means to a casing 135 in which are mounted the microphone 129 &c. Spectacles frame.-One arm 125, Fig. 27, of a spectacles frame is formed at its rear end as a casing and in the arm are disposed a receiver 126, mercury cell 127 and other components 124. At the rear end of the arm is disposed another casing 128 containing a microphone 129. The casings 125, 128 are coupled together by a rigid tube 140, Fig. 25, wrapped in a foamed rubber sheet 141, the opposite ends being inserted in the ends of casings 125 and 128. Other compliable coupling means may be used.",ARDENTE ACOUSTIC LAB LTD,COHEN MICHAEL,,https://lens.org/024-306-275-679-175,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,3,0,G02C11/06;;G02C11/06;;H04R25/603;;H04R25/603;;H04R25/609;;H04R25/609;;H04R2225/021;;H04R2225/021;;H04R2225/57;;H04R2225/57,G02C11/06;;H04R25/02,H4J JAAA          JAAA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The sticky canary router implements a mapping algorithm that determines the routing of each request based on a current time, a time window for the routing, and a characteristic of the request. Notably, the mapping algorithm may be implemented such that, for time segments with duration equal to the time window, the sticky canary router routes all requests received from a particular device in a consistent fashion – either to the canary cluster or to a baseline cluster.

The templates are written as an extension to the active server page technology in a combination of hypertext language and scripting language. The active server templates specify an additional, higher order scripting level that distinguishes a second level of code by a new delimiter. During creation of the storefront, the page generator reads each active server template file and converts it to a scripting program having executable lines of code derived from the higher-order level of instructions denoted by the new delimiters. The page generator then executes the scripting program using the merchant data as input to produce a customized set of active server pages.

Un champ de masquage est un réseau de réaction F2 coopératif-compétitif à commande automatique du gain, auto-similaire, à échelles multiples. Le réseau F2 reçoit des formes ou configurations d'entrée provenant d'un filtre adaptatif F1 -> F2 qui est activé par un niveau de traitement antérieur F1 et se comporte comme une mémoire à contenu adressable. Il active des codes comprimés de reconnaissance qui prédisent les formes d'activation passant au travers du réseau en scintillant, et il inhibe de manière compétitive, ou masque, des codes qui ne prédisent pas les formes F1. En particulier, un champ de masquage peut détecter simultanément des groupements multiples dans ces formes d'entrée et affecter des poids d'activation aux codes pour ces groupements qui prédisent les informations contextuelles contenues dans les formes et l'apprentissage préalable du sytème. Un champ de masquage rééchelonne automatiquement sa sensibilité lorsque la dimension totale d'une forme d'entrée change, et reste néanmoins sensible à la micro-structure dans chaque forme d'entrée. De cette manière, un champ de masquage active plus fortement un code pour la totalité de la forme F1 que pour ces parties saillantes, mais amplifie néanmoins le code pour une partie de la forme lorsqu'elle devient une forme totale dans un nouveau contexte d'entrée. Un champ de masquage peut également être amorcé par des entrées provenant de F1: il peut activer des codes qui représentent des prédictions quant à savoir comment la forme F1 peut évoluer dans l'intervalle de temps ultérieur. Le réseau F2 présente également une propriété d'affinage adaptative: la répétition d'une forme F1 familière peut accorder le filtre adaptatif pour obtenir une activation spatiale plus focale de son code de reconnaissance de F2 qu'il n'est possible avec une forme d'entrée non familière.

The corrections are performed using a parametric class of warping functions that include Spatially Varying Uniform (SVU) scaling functions. The SVU scaling functions and scaling factors are used to perform vertical scaling and horizontal scaling on the wide-angle image pixel coordinates.

The computer system functions under the direction of standard operating software and video editing software which provide the user with an interface for controlling both playback and clip editing of video information from the video source. Upon initialization of the editing system, the user is presented with at least a video window for displaying the video information, a control window for regulating playback of the video information, and a clip list window having a number of rows of edit windows organized under begin, end, and clip columns. The user controls playback of video from the video source within the video window through manipulation of standard playback direction and speed indicators. To mark a video frame in the video window as either a begin or end point of a video clip, the user clicks on the desired video frame with a mouse associated with the editing system. A small digitized version of the requested video frame is then created and attached to the cursor. This small digitized frame (SDF) can then be moved in tandem with the cursor from the video window to an edit window and released. Begin and end points of clips are created by releasing an SDF within an edit window under the appropriate column. Releasing an SDF within an edit window under the clip column causes that SDF to be entered as both the begin and end point of the clip. Numerous rows of edit windows can be created in a similar manner. When the begin and end edit windows in the same row are filled with different SDFs, the video frames between those respective points are digitized and automatically inserted into the clip column for that row in an animated form. SDFs can likewise be directly manipulated to modify the content or sequence of edit windows or to change the video frame being played within the video window.",APPLE COMPUTER,MILLS MICHAEL;;COHEN JONATHAN,APPLE COMPUTER INC.

April 26, 1951 [May 24, 1950], No. 13076/50. Class 40 (iv). A variable resistance microphone primarily intended for hearing aids comprises an element coated with stress sensitive resistance material which has sound-varied stress imparted to it by a diaphragm. As shown in Fig. 1, the element consists of a mica disc 1 which is provided at the centre region with a stresssensitive carbon or metallic coating 2 and is held between threaded casing parts 5, 6. The disc is coupled by a rod 8 to a rim-clamped diaphragm 7 and is backed by a stiffening ring 10 which concentrates the imparted stress at the centre. Flexible leads 3 provide electrical connection to the coating. In an alternative arrangement, the disc 1 may constitute the diaphragm. In an alternative arrangement, Fig. 4, the element comprises a mica strip 21 having a carbon track coating 22. Metal stiffening strips 210 are arranged on either side of a centre point D to which the diaphragm is attached. In a modification, Fig. 5 (not shown), a single stiffening strip is provided, the strip being weakened at the diaphragm attachment point by a transverse saw cut. A further arrangement, Fig. 6, utilizes a carbon impregnated string or cord 61 of glass fibre, natural or artificial silk or asbestos. In this embodiment the cord is tensioned by a bowed spring 62 and is attached to a diaphragm 67 through a connector 68. Adjustable spring tension is effected by a screw 65 co-operating with a fixed nut and collar 66, 69.",FORTIPHONE LTD,COHEN MICHAEL;;WOLFF JOACHIM,,https://lens.org/010-150-448-894-45X,Granted Patent,no,0,4,1,1,0,H04R21/02,H04R21/02,H4J JCG           JCG,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Method according to the second version additionally consists in the fact that the rotation force for the material axial propagation in the section φ=720–810°, close to constant, in which on section φ=0–360° inclination angles of helical α coil turn are made: on section φ=0–30° smoothly varying the angle α from 85–89° to 73–78°, then on section φ=30–180°—from 73–78° up to 75–78°, on section φ=180–360°—from 75–78° up to 78–83° in relation to screw lengthwise axis. According to the third version, the method further consists in that the force of rotation for movement of the material in the axial direction of compaction in the section φ=720–810°, close to constant, in which on section φ=360–720° inclination angles of coil auger spiral turn is within range from 78–83° to 73–78° with simultaneous change of working section flow section so, that screw generatrix along inner surface of working channel is made with inclination Δ=−3 to 5° to longitudinal axis in direction from first shank to second one, i.e. towards outlet, and screw generatrix along outer surface of turns is made with slope γ=2–10° to longitudinal axis in direction from first shank to second one, i.e. towards outlet. Method according to fourth version additionally consists in the fact, that rotation force for cutting in section φ=0–360°, close to constant with steeply falling areas at beginning and end of interval, force of rotation for advancement and preliminary treatment of material on section φ=360–720°, close to constant, force of rotation for movement, sealing in axial direction of material in section φ=720–810°, close to constant, in which on section φ=720–810° inclination angles of screw coil spiral range from 73–78° to 83–87°. Screw auger, mainly for mincer, comprises first shank for connection of power drive, screw part, second shank end for connection of knives. Screw part comprises φ=810°. Working path is profiled so that on section φ=0–30° there is a gradual change in the inclination angle of the α auger spiral from 85–89° to 73–78°, then on section φ=30–180°—from 73–78° up to 75–78°, on section φ=180–360°—from 75–78° up to 78–83°, in relation to screw longitudinal axis, and on section φ=360–720° inclination angle of spiral turn of screw α is from 78–83° to 73–78° in relation to screw lengthwise axis with simultaneous change of working section flow section. At that, change of the working section flow section is made so that the screw generatrix along the inner surface of the working channel has an inclination Δ=−3 to 5° to longitudinal axis in direction from first shank to second one, i.e. in direction of product outlet, screw generatrix along outer surface of turns has slope γ=2–10° to longitudinal axis, in direction from first shank to second one, i.e. towards product outlet, and on section φ=720–810° inclination angle of helical α coil turn is in range from 73–78° to 83–87°.EFFECT: methods of constructing a profile of a screw auger and an auger with such a profile provide a mechanism for cutting and transporting material to a grinding point with aligned torque characteristics, as well as with lower power required for mincer drive.5 cl, 7 dwg",OBSHCHESTVO S OGRANICHENNOJ OTVETSTVENNOSTYU KRONOS,COHEN PAUL;;SCHULER MICHAEL,,https://lens.org/034-658-249-341-316,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,3,0,B02C18/30;;B02C19/22;;B02C23/02,B02C18/30;;B02C19/22;;B02C23/02,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

A masking field is a multiple scale, self-similar, automatically gain-controlled cooperative-competitive feedback network F2. Network F2 receives input patterns from an adaptive filter F1 ← F2 that is activated by a prior processing level F1 and behaves like a content-addressable memory. It activates compressed recognition codes that are predictive with respect to the activation patterns flickering across, and competitively inhibits, or masks, codes which are unpredictive with respect to the F1 patterns. In particular, a masking field can simultaneously detect multiple groupings within its input patterns and assign activation weights to the codes for these groupings which are predictive with respect to the contextual information embedded within the patterns and the prior learning of the system. A masking field automatically rescales its sensitivity as the overall size of an input pattern changes, yet also remains sensitive to the microstructure within each input pattern. In this way, masking field more strongly activates a code for the whole F1 pattern than for its salient parts, yet amplifies the code for a pattern part when it becomes a pattern whole in a new input context. A masking field can also be primed by inputs from F1: it can activate codes which represent predictions of how the F1 pattern may envolve in the subsequent time interval. Network F2 also exhibits an adaptive sharpening property: repetition of a familiar F1 pattern can tune the adaptive filter to elicit a more focal spatial activation of its F2 recognition code than does an unfamiliar input pattern. The F2 recognition code also becomes less distributed when an input pattern contains more contextual information on which to base an unambiguous prediction of which F1 pattern is being processed. Thus a masking field suggests a solution of the credit assignment problem by embodying a real-time code for the predictive evidence contained within its input patterns. Such capabilities are useful in speech recognition, visual object recognition, and cognitive information processing. An absolutely stable design for a masking field is disclosed through an analysis of the computer simulations. This design suggests how associative mechanisms, cooperative-competitive interactions, and modulatory gating signals can be joined together to regulate the learning of compressed recognition codes.",UNIV BOSTON,GROSSBERG STEPHEN;;COHEN MICHAEL,,https://lens.org/073-027-209-476-340,Patent Application,yes,0,5,5,7,0,G10L15/16;;G06V10/451;;G10L15/16;;G06V10/451,G06F15/18;;G06K9/66;;G10L15/16,G4R REL           REL;;G4R R1F           REL;;G4R R11D          REL;;G4R R11E          REL;;G4R R11F          REL;;G4R R8A           REL;;G4R R8G           REL;;G4R R9B           REL;;G4R R9C           REL,1,0,,,"Proceedings of the Second Annual Bionics Symposium, 30 August - 1 September 1961, (Cornell University, US), P.

This is achieved in that the linking system comprises a first selection unit ( 110 ) for selecting the object in the image, a determining unit ( 120 ) for determining a subset of related candidate object models from the set of object models on the basis of the selected object, and a second selection unit for selecting the particular object model from the subset of related candidate object models. By starting the linking process with selecting the object in the image, the task of determining the subset of related candidate object models is delegated to the determining unit and does not require user interaction.

Masking field network F.sub.2 receives input patterns from an adaptive filter F.sub.1 .fwdarw.F.sub.2 that is activated by a prior processing level F.sub.1. The network F.sub.2 activates compressed recognition close that are predictive with respect to the activation patterns flickering across F.sub.1, and competitively inhibits, or masks, codes which are unpredictive with respect to the F.sub.1 patterns. The masking field can simultaneously detect multiple groupings within its input patterns and assign activation weights to the recognition codes for these groupings which are predictive with respect to the contextual information embedded within the patterns and the prior learning of the network. Automatic rescaling of sensitivity of the masking field as the overall size of an input pattern changes, allows stronger activation of a code for the whole F.sub.1 pattern than for its salient parts. Network F.sub.2 also exhibits adaptive sharpening such that repetition of a familiar F.sub.1 pattern can tune the adaptive filter to elicit a more focal spatial activation of its F.sub.2 recognition code than does an unfamiliar input pattern. The F.sub.2 recognition code also becomes less distributed when an input pattern contains more contextual information on which to base an unambiguous prediction of the F.sub.1 pattern being processed. Thus the masking field embodies a real-time code to process the predictive evidence contained within its input patterns. Such capabilities are useful in speech recognition, visual object recognition, and cognitive information processi n GOVERNMENT SUPPORT This invention was made with Government support under AFOSR-85-0149 awarded by the Air Force.

The system, referred to as the Lumigraph system, collects a complete appearance of either a synthetic or real object (or a scene), stores a representation of the appearance, and uses the representation to render images of the object from any vantage point. The appearance of an object is a collection of light rays that emanate from the object in all directions. The system stores the representation of the appearance as a set of coefficients of a 4-dimensional function, referred to as the Lumigraph function. From the Lumigraph function with these coefficients, the Lumigraph system can generate 2-dimensional images of the object from any vantage point. The Lumigraph system generates an image by evaluating the Lumigraph function to identify the intensity values of light rays that would emanate from the object to form the image. The Lumigraph system then combines these intensity values to form the image.",MICROSOFT CORP,COHEN MICHAEL F;;GRZESZCZUK RADEK,UBER TECHNOLOGIES INC (2015-07-23);;MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (1996-06-04),https://lens.org/065-269-144-843-50X,Granted Patent,yes,47,157,4,4,0,G06T15/06;;G06T15/50;;G06T15/50;;G06T15/06,G06T15/06;;G06T15/50,382/154;;345/113;;345/139;;345/328,30,19,127-940-899-756-223;;002-376-662-411-019;;023-267-477-284-790;;174-058-134-713-412;;041-232-503-728-408;;038-542-062-782-382;;007-955-970-389-341;;074-027-679-313-032;;108-507-296-958-073;;004-174-548-326-096;;049-374-794-753-447;;123-924-875-333-036;;107-901-988-075-895;;091-104-395-878-173;;053-190-460-530-532;;085-182-563-953-694;;003-105-550-905-390;;095-264-022-660-794;;079-685-711-424-207,10.1007/978-3-7091-6916-2_19;;10.1016/b978-0-12-460515-2.50005-6;;10.1109/38.365004;;10.1109/visual.1990.146396;;10.1109/iccv.1990.139613;;10.1049/el:19931221;;10.1109/34.121783;;10.1109/2945.466720;;10.1109/34.35495;;10.1049/cp:19971284;;10.1145/237170.237200;;10.1109/mcg.1984.275878;;10.1002/nme.1620151110;;10.1109/38.180119;;10.1080/00994480.1993.10748029;;10.1145/218380.218395;;10.1145/237170.237199;;10.1145/218380.218398;;10.1006/ciun.1993.1029,"D.

The system, referred to as the Lumigraph system, collects a complete appearance of either a synthetic or real object (or a scene), stores a representation of the appearance, and uses the representation to render images of the object from any vantage point. The appearance of an object is a collection of light rays that emanate from the object in all directions. The system stores the representation of the appearance as a set of coefficients of a 4-dimensional function, referred to as the Lumigraph function. From the Lumigraph function with these coefficients, the Lumigraph system can generate 2-dimensional images of the object from any vantage point. The Lumigraph system generates an image by evaluating the Lumigraph function to identify the intensity values of light rays that would emanate from the object to form the image.

    Disclosed is a method for diagnosing the tumorigenic grade of a malignant tissue. The method entails determining the amount of dystroglycan protein of the malignant tissue relative to a standard. Suitable methods for determining the amount of dystroglycan protein of the tissue are provided, and include measuring the amount of mRNA transcripts which encode dystroglycan, and also performing western blot analysis or immunofluorescence analysis on the tissue components to detect -dystroglycan or -dystroglycan. An antibody probe which binds specifically to the C-terminus of -dystroglycan, is provided. This method is applicable to human malignant tissue, especially adenocarcinoma, and preferably prostate or mammary adenocarcinoma. This method can also be applied to the detection of a cancerous disease state in a tissue of a patient, with a decreased level of dystroglycan protein being indicative of the presence of cancer. Also disclosed is a method for determining the prognosis of a patient afflicted with a malignancy by determining the expression level of the dystroglycan gene in a tissue sample of the malignancy, and comparing the expression level to a standard, with a decreased level of dystroglycan expression being indicative of unfavorable prognosis. A method for identifying an individual at risk for the development of cancer, or an individual at risk for the recurrence of cancer after treatment, is also disclosed. Similarly, a method for identifying individuals at risk for developing cancer by screening for mutations in the dystroglycan genes of the individual is also provided. One such mutation is the allelic loss of human chromosome 3p21.

   The present invention allows a user to audibly and interactively browse through a network of audio information, forming a seamless integration of the world wide web and the entire telephone network browsable from any telephone set. Preferably a browser controller allows the user to receive audio information and to transmit verbal instructions. The browser controller links the user to voice pages, which can be any telephone station or world wide web page, in response to voice commands. Upon linking, certain information is played with an audio indicia which identifies a linking capability. If the user repeats the information set off by the audio indicia, the telephone number or URL of the selected link is transmitted to the browser controller. The browser controller establishes a new link with the identified telephone number or URL, and if successful, disconnects the previous link. The originator no longer needs to know of the existence of the receiver nor the telephone number or URL of the receiver because this invention provides a method to browse the entire telephone network and world wide web and to connect to a receiver by saying the name of the hyperlink. This brings the power of the world wide web to the telephone network. In effect, this invention takes the PSTN from its current state as a set of more than 800 million nodes including means to make pairwise connections and converts it to a highly interconnected browsable web, as well as integrating it with the entire world wide web.

A specimen of semen is treated after a predetermined time to increase the relative ability of a at least a portion of the semen to conceive an offspring of the desired sex. The treatment preferably comprises contacting the sperm cells with an agent that preferentially effects sperm cells of a selected sex type. In some preferred embodiments, the semen is separated into two components. A first component has a higher number of sperm of the desired sex type than sperm of a non desired sex type and a second component has a higher number of sperm of the non desired sex type relative to sperm of the desired sex type. In one embodiment, the separating step is performed after a predetermined percent of the sperm cells exhibit a punctate pattern, which is capable of determination by labeling the sperm cells with Koo antibody and determining the percent of cells labeled. In another embodiment, the separating step is performed after waiting for a time determined by locating a maximum in the curve obtained by plotting percent female cells determined by FISH against percent Koo positive cells, determining the time at which the maximum percent female cells occurs, and beginning the following step no earlier than about one hour before the time of the maximum percent female cells. In yet another embodiment, the separating step is performed after waiting for a period of time between about 2 hours and about 24 hours after collection of the ejaculate. Preferably, in the separating step, the sperm is contacted with a cell binding agent, permitting the sperm of the non desired sex type to preferentially bind to the cell binding agent, and the cell binding agent with preferentially bound sperm of the non desired sex type is separated from non bound sperm.",VICAM LP;;COHEN BARB ARIEL;;MORRIS MICHAEL F,COHEN BARB ARIEL;;MORRIS MICHAEL F,,https://lens.org/113-937-569-273-872,Search Report,yes,4,0,8,8,0,A01K2227/101;;A01K2227/105;;C12N5/0612;;C12N2517/10;;C12N5/0612;;A01K2227/105;;C12N2517/10;;A01K2227/101,A01N1/02;;A01K67/027;;C12N5/00;;C12N5/071;;G01N/,,1,1,051-238-687-789-642,10.1111/j.1600-0897.1998.tb00387.x;;9689360,"SILLS E.

A first component has a higher number of sperm of the desire d sex type than sperm of a non desired sex type and a second component has a higher number of sperm of the non desired sex type relative to sperm of the desired sex type. In one embodiment, the separating step is performed after a predetermined percent of the sperm cells exhibit a punctate pattern, which i s capable of determination by labeling the sperm cells with Koo antibody and determining the percent of cells labeled. In another embodiment, the separating step is performed after waiting for a time determined by locating a maximum in the curve obtained by plotting percent female cells determined by FISH against percent Koo positive cells, determining the time at which the maximum percent female cells occurs, and beginning the following step no earlier than about one hour before the time of the maximum percent female cells. In yet another embodiment, the separating step is performed after waiting for a period of time between about 2 hours and about 24 hours after collection of the ejaculate.

Within the speech processor, models are provided which employ the observation probabilities in the recognition process. The number of context-dependent nets is reduced to a single net by sharing the units of the input layer and the hidden layer and the weights connecting them in the multilayer perceptron while providing one output layer for each relevant context. Each output layer is trained as an independent network on the specific examples of the corresponding context it represents. Training may be optimized at an intermediate set of weights between the context-independent-associated weights and the context-dependent associated weights to which training would normally converge.",STANFORD RES INST INT,COHEN MICHAEL H;;FRANCO HORACIO E,SRI INTERNATIONAL A CORP.

The technique generally involves first computing a global tone map of the wide-angle, HDR image in advance of rendering the sub-image. The global tone map is then used during rendering to compute a local tone map based on the average luminance and contrast of the pixels of the sub-image. In addition, the sub-image can be tone mapped as part of the rendering of a sequence of sub-images during a viewer-executed panning and/or zooming session. In this case, the local tone maps can be kept from changing too rapidly by adding a hysteresis feature to smooth out the intensity changes between successive sub-images.",MICROSOFT CORP,COHEN MICHAEL;;UYTTENDAELE MATTHEW;;KOPF JOHANNES,MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (2007-08-03),https://lens.org/008-278-865-182-980,Granted Patent,yes,13,49,2,2,0,G06T5/40;;G06T2207/20208;;G06T5/90;;G06T2207/20208;;G06T5/40;;G06T5/90,G06K9/40,382/254;;382/100;;382/274,9,8,008-963-565-754-84X;;118-016-855-377-731;;095-181-359-994-155;;009-978-207-560-760;;060-333-674-927-622;;031-499-365-673-874;;011-415-482-114-733;;029-820-669-784-385,10.1145/1275808.1276494;;10.1145/566654.566574;;10.1145/566654.566573;;10.1145/1141911.1141936;;10.1080/10867651.2002.10487554;;10.1145/566654.566575;;10.1145/1239451.1239544;;10.2172/486125,"YouTube video: ""Capturing and Viewing Gigapixel Images"" by Johannes Kopf, Matt Uyttendaele, Oliver Deussen, and Michael Cohen, submitted by user ""Johanns0r"", available as of May 14, 2007 at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5UUrxL-2t0.;;Durand, F., J.

Upon linking, certain information is played with an audio indicia which identifies a linking capability. If the user repeats the information set off by the audio indicia, the telephone number or URL of the selected link is transmitted to the browser controller. The browser controller establishes a new link with the identified telephone number or URL, and if successful, disconnects the previous link. The originator no longer needs to know of the existence of the receiver nor the telephone number or URL of the receiver because this invention provides a method to browse the entire telephone network and world wide web and to connect to a receiver by saying the name of the hyperlink. This brings the power of the world wide web to the telephone network.

A specimen of semen is treated after a predetermined time to increase the relative ability of a at least a portion of the semen to conceive an offspring of the desired sex. The treatment preferably comprises contacting the sperm cells with an agent that preferentially effects sperm cells of a selected sex type. In some preferred embodiments, the semen is separated into two components. A first component has a higher number of sperm of the desired sex type than sperm of a non desired sex type and a second component has a higher number of sperm of the non desired sex type relative to sperm of the desired sex type. In one embodiment, the separating step is performed after a predetermined percent of the sperm cells exhibit a punctate pattern, which is capable of determination by labeling the sperm cells with Koo antibody and determining the percent of cells labeled. In another embodiment, the separating step is performed after waiting for a time determined by locating a maximum in the curve obtained by plotting percent female cells determined by FISH against percent Koo positive cells, determining the time at which the maximum percent female cells occurs, and beginning the following step no earlier than about one hour before the time of the maximum percent female cells. In yet another embodiment, the separating step is performed after waiting for a period of time between about 2 hours and about 24 hours after collection of the ejaculate. Preferably, in the separating step, the sperm is contacted with a cell binding agent, permitting the sperm of the non desired sex type to preferentially bind to the cell binding agent, and the cell binding agent with preferentially bound sperm of the non desired sex type is separated from non bound sperm.",VICAM LP,COHEN BARB A;;MORRIS MICHAEL F,VICAM L.P (2003-11-26),https://lens.org/031-349-053-510-781,Patent Application,yes,12,23,8,8,0,A01K2227/101;;A01K2227/105;;C12N5/0612;;C12N2517/10;;C12N5/0612;;A01K2227/105;;C12N2517/10;;A01K2227/101,A01K67/027;;C12N5/00;;C12N5/071;;G01N/,800/21,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The sleeve covers the barrel over the primary contact area of the bat. The sleeve holds a force sensor placed inside it such that, when slid over the bat, the force sensor is coincident with the sweet spot of the bat. When a ball comes in contact with the sweet spot, the force sensor directly beneath it is triggered such that instantaneous feedback is given to the athlete thereby making him/her aware of accurate sweet spot contact. Moreover, an array of cylindrical contact/force sensors can be positioned such that the user gets feedback that would depend on how far from the sweet spot the user strikes/contacts the ball. The user may be notified by audio, visual, or sensory cues.",APRIL MICHAEL E;;COHEN MARC H,APRIL MICHAEL E;;COHEN MARC H,,https://lens.org/124-678-592-985-03X,Granted Patent,yes,5,7,2,2,0,A63B71/0622;;A63B2071/0625;;A63B2071/0655;;A63B2071/0694;;A63B2220/833;;A63B2225/20;;A63B2225/50;;A63F13/245;;A63F13/235;;A63B69/0002;;A63B71/0619;;A63B2069/0008;;A63B2208/0204;;A63B2220/53;;A63B69/0002;;A63B24/0062;;A63B71/0619;;A63B2069/0008;;A63B2208/0204;;A63B2220/53;;A63B71/0622;;A63B2071/0625;;A63B2071/0655;;A63B2071/0694;;A63B2220/833;;A63B2225/20;;A63B2225/50;;A63F13/245;;A63F13/235;;A63F13/00;;G06F1/1626,A63B69/00;;A63B24/00;;A63B59/00;;A63B71/06;;A63F13/00;;G06F1/16,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE
