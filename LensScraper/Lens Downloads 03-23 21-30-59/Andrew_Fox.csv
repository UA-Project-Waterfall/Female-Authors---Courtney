This connection then forms the backhaul link for the first base station, via the relay device. In another aspect the device causes the first base station to interrupt its transmissions while the device detects signals from other base stations. In another aspect, a control device initiates suppression of transmit signals from base stations while detecting signals transmitted from the remaining base stations.

These filtered signals are supplied to a second low noise amplifier, and the further amplified signals are supplied to a second narrowband filter. These signals, at the received radio frequency are then supplied to a quadrature demodulator, for direct downconversion to baseband. This combination of two low noise amplifiers and two narrowband filters provides the required attenuation of the interferer to avoid saturating the subsequent quadrature demodulator, while also providing enough gain to ensure that the noise figure of the received signal is not degraded.

The control circuit includes a pair of oppositely poled main thyristors in the primary circuit with a firing arrangement to trigger the main thyristors to maintain desired conditions at the electrodes. The primary circuit does not require a current limiting reactor to limit primary current when a spark discharge takes place at the electrodes. A pair of auxiliary thyristors are each connected in series with a capacitor. Each capacitor and the respective auxiliary thyristor form a branch and these two branches are each connected in parallel with the main thyristors. A rectifier is connected to keep the capacitors charged in opposing directions. When a spark discharge at the electrodes is detected, the firing circuit temporarily interrupts the firing pulses to the main thyristor which is conducting when the spark discharge occurs, and provides firing pulses to a respective auxiliary thyristor poled to conduct in the same direction. When the auxiliary thyristor is fired, the capacitor in series with it discharges through it and creates a voltage at the main thyristor which was conducting, and the voltage is such that the main thyristor switches to its non-conducting state before the end of the half cycle. The high primary current that could result with spark discharge is thus stopped before it reaches destructive levels.",GEN ELECTRIC CANADA,STEVENSON ANDREW C;;FOX KENNETH R,,https://lens.org/036-799-058-253-905,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,B03C3/68;;B03C3/68,B03C3/68,317-2.5,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The control circuit includes a pair of oppositely poled main thyristors in the primary circuit with a firing arrangement to trigger the main thyristors to maintain desired conditions at the electrodes. The primary circuit does not require a current limiting reactor to limit primary current when a spark discharge takes place at the electrodes. A pair of auxiliary thyristors are each connected in series with a capacitor. Each capacitor and the respective auxiliary thyristor form a branch and these two branches are each connected in parallel with the main thyristors. A rectifier is connected to keep the capacitors charged in opposing directions. When a spark discharge at the electrodes is detected, the firing circuit temporarily interrupts the firing pulses to the main thyristor which is conducting when the spark discharge occurs, and provides firing pulses to a respective auxiliary thyristor poled to conduct in the same direction. When the auxiliary thyristor is fired, the capacitor in series with it discharges through it and creates a voltage at the main thyristor which was conducting, and the voltage is such that the main thyristor switches to its non-conducting state before the end of the half cycle.

    A document scanning system (  10  ) communicates with a scanner (  40  ) to provide scanning characteristics and scanning coordinates for a scan and to receive a scanned image (FIG.  3  ) from the scanner. The document scanning system processes scanning requests from an application (  20  ), defines a set of images to be scanned and calculates the scanning characteristics (colour depth, resolution, brightness, contrast) and scanning coordinates from a document set definition comprising one or more image definitions. Each image definition includes an associated set of coordinates and scanning characteristics for the or each image. A configuration file (  30  ) stores the document set definition and the document scanning system comprises a parser module (  12  ) adapted to read the configuration file.

The vertical slide table includes one or more horizontal tracks, an arcuate guide rail parallel to the horizontal tracks, and a horizontal slide table that moves along the horizontal tracks. The horizontal slide table comprises an end effector, which is a suspended perpendicular arm with a lip on the bottom edge that supports a load. The end effector, when unloaded, follows the path of the arcuate guide rail as the horizontal slide table moves along the one or more horizontal tracks. In this way, the end effector engages the load in positions near the edge of the arcuate guide rail, but in central positions along the arcuate guide rail, the end effector is distanced from the load so that it can freely maneuver.",HALL DAVID R;;PRIDDIS ANDREW;;BURNETT BRAQUEL;;DAY NATHAN;;FOX JOE,HALL DAVID R;;PRIDDIS ANDREW;;BURNETT BRAQUEL;;DAY NATHAN;;FOX JOE,HALL LABS LLC (2018-07-26),https://lens.org/174-554-393-459-474,Patent Application,yes,22,0,2,2,0,B65G1/04;;B65G1/04,B65G1/137,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

Outdoor weather data (e.g., outdoor temperature information), is obtained. A Total Runtime Value of the HVAC system is determined based upon the obtained outdoor weather data. Finally, a replacement status of the air filter is estimated as a function of a comparison of the Total Runtime Value with a Baseline Value. By correlating air filter replacement status with an estimated runtime of the HVAC system, a credible predictor of air filter usage is provided. By estimating fan runtime based on easily-obtained outdoor weather data, the methods are readily implemented with any existing HVAC system and do not require installation of sensors or other mechanical or electrical components to the HVAC system.",3M INNOVATIVE PROPERTIES CO,FOX ANDREW R;;LOBNER ERIC C;;MEYER THERESA M;;STANKIEWICZ BRIAN J,3M INNOVATIVE PROPERTIES COMPANY (2017-05-24),https://lens.org/004-685-831-189-503,Patent Application,yes,7,31,17,17,0,F24F11/00;;F24F11/39;;F24F2130/10;;F24F2130/00;;F24F11/63;;F24F2110/50;;F24F11/30;;F24F2110/52;;Y02B30/70;;F24F11/39;;F24F2130/10;;F24F2130/00;;F24F11/00;;F24F11/63;;F24F2110/50;;F24F11/30;;F24F2110/52;;B01D46/0086;;B01D2279/50,B01D46/00;;F24F11/00,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

More particularly, peripheral blood RNA and protein biomarkers are disclosed that are useful for distinguishing between the host immune response to bacteria compared to the host immune response to other causes of systemic inflammation including trauma, burns, autoimmune disease, asthma, anaphylaxis, arthritis, obesity and viral infections. As such, the biomarkers are useful for distinguishing bacterial-associated systemic inflammatory response syndrome from non-bacterial systemic inflammation to provide clinicians with strong negative predictive value (>95%) so that sepsis can be excluded as a diagnosis in patients presenting to ED with clinical signs of systemic inflammation.",IMMUNEXPRESS PTY LTD,BRANDON RICHARD BRUCE;;FOX BRIAN ANDREW;;MCHUGH LEO CHARLES;;SAMPSON DAYLE LORAND,IMMUNEXPRESS PTY LTD (2018-08-06),https://lens.org/024-054-712-191-488,Patent Application,yes,0,0,9,9,358,C12Q1/6883;;G01N33/6893;;C12Q2600/158;;G01N2800/26;;C12Q1/6883;;C12Q2600/158;;G01N33/56911;;G01N2800/26;;G01N2469/00;;A61B5/412;;G01N33/57484,G01N33/569;;A61B5/00;;C12Q1/6883;;G01N33/574,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The methods, apparatus, kits and compositions can be used in mammals for diagnosing, making treatment decisions, determining the next procedure or diagnostic test, or management of patients suspected of having an infection, including those presenting with fever or other signs of systemic inflammation. More particularly, peripheral blood RNA and protein biomarkers are disclosed that are useful for distinguishing between the host immune response to bacteria compared to the host immune response to other causes of systemic inflammation including trauma, burns, autoimmune disease, asthma, anaphylaxis, arthritis, obesity and viral infections. As such, the biomarkers are useful for distinguishing bacterial-associated systemic inflammatory response syndrome from nonbacterial systemic inflammation to provide clinicians with strong negative predictive value (>95%) so that sepsis can be excluded as a diagnosis in patients presenting to ED with clinical signs of systemic inflammation.
