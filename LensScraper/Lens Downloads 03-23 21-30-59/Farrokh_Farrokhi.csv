By doing so the functionality of the beamforming coefficients and the rake multiplier vectors is joined, and it is possible to optimize the rake receiver performance. In other words, because of the inventive architecture, the optimization of the weights for the rake multiplier and the beam forming may be performed jointly to yield a single rake combining weight vector which optimally weights the output of each rake finger.

SOLUTION: Even when the correlation of a certain level to be used in a radio system having a plurality of transmission antennas and reception antennas exists, it is possible to develop (generate) signals capable of achieving the maximum open loop capacity by channels having the correlation. In this principle, signals to be transmitted by various antennas are processed so that the maximum information carrying capabilities can be improved. That is, data to be transmitted are divided into (M+1) pieces of sub-streams. One connected signal constituted of one common weighted version of the sub-streams and one corresponding weighted version to be frequently supplied to the antennas of the sub-streams is supplied to the respective transmission antennas, and M pieces of transmission signals are allowed to exist as a whole. A receiver equipped with N pieces of antennas receive the M pieces of transmission signals connected by the channels, and reconstitute the original data from those transmission signals.

   Signals are developed for use in a wireless system with multiple transmit and multiple receive antennas so that even in the face of some correlation the most open-loop capacity that can be achieved using a substantially open-loop system with a channel of that level of correlation is obtained. In accordance with the principles of the invention, the signals transmitted from the various antennas are processed so as to improve their ability to convey the maximum amount of information. More specifically, the data to be transmitted is divided into M1 substreams, where M is the number of transmit antennas. Each transmit antenna is supplied with a combination signal that is made up of a weighted version of a common one of the substreams and a weighted version of a respective one of the substreams that is supplied uniquely for that antenna, so that there are M transmit signals. A receiver having N antennas receives the M transmit signals as combined by the channel and reconstitutes the original data therefrom. This may be achieved using successive decoding techniques. Advantageously, the capacity, i.e., the rate of information that can be conveyed with an arbitrarily small probability of error when the instantaneous forward channel condition is unknown to the transmitter, is maximized.

    In a mobile cellular communications system power control and space-time diversity are applied in combination to the uplink and downlink. In the uplink, mobile powers and equalization/diversity combining vectors at base stations are, calculated jointly, with the result that the mobile transmitted power is minimized, while the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) at each link is maintained above a threshold. In the downlink, a multitap transmit diversity strategy adjusts the transmit weight vectors with the result that the SNR at each mobile is set to a specified value. The combination of power control and space-time diversity apply to networks with fading channels, including networks in which the number of cochannels and multipaths are larger than the number of antenna elements. The invention achieves the optimal solution for the uplink that minimizes the mobile power, and achieves a feasible solution for the downlink if there exists any.

SOLUTION: The number of bit streams to be transmitted simultaneously is adjusted and decreased, according to the correlation level, and at the same time plural versions of every bit stream weighted in various ways are transmitted at the same time. These weighted versions are coupled together for generating a single-coupled weighting signal. A receiver processes the received signals, as through all signals arrived at a receiving antenna with no correlation.

The described algorithm is based on the observation that for some wavelet bases with sufficiently many vanishing moments, the ramp-filtered version of the scaling function as well as the wavelet function has extremely rapid decay, with the variance of the elements of the nullspace is being negligible in the locally reconstructed image.",UNIV GEORGE MASON,WALNUT DAVID FRANCIS;;BERENSTEIN CARLOS ALBERTO;;LIU K J RAY;;RASHID-FARROKHI FARROKH,,https://lens.org/178-948-466-709-41X,Granted Patent,yes,2,84,1,1,0,G06T11/006;;G06T2211/421;;Y10S378/901;;G06T11/006;;G06T2211/421;;Y10S378/901,G06T11/00,378/4;;378/901,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
