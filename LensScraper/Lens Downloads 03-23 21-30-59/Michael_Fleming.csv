The vent-latch interlock assembly includes a pressure vent door (40) that is positioned to be seated in an opening (42) formed in the aircraft door (20). The pressure vent door (40) is rotatably attached to a shaft (44) that is rotatably mounted to the aircraft door (20). A set of springs (68) normally biases the pressure vent door (40) away from the opening (42). A drive rod (45) connected between the latch assembly (32) and the shaft holds the pressure vent door (40) in the closed position when the aircraft door (20) is closed. An interlock cable (46) is connected between the pressure vent door and an interlock follower (48) and is located next to the latch assembly (32). When the pressure vent door (40) is closed, the interlock cable forces the interlock follower against the latch assembly (32) to prevent actuation of the latch assembly and opening of the aircraft door (20). When the latch assembly (32) is actuated to open the door, the drive rod (45) releases its force against the pressure vent door (40). If the pressures inside and outside of the aircraft are approximately equal, the springs (68) will pivot the pressure vent door (40) open. This causes the interlock cable (46) to release the tension on the interlock follower (48) so that the follower moves away from the latch assembly (32) and the latch assembly can continue to be actuated in order to open the aircraft door (20).",BOEING CO,FLEMING MICHAEL A;;STURM MICHAEL C,BOEING COMPANY THE (1993-01-29),https://lens.org/197-689-223-599-274,Granted Patent,yes,13,97,1,1,0,B64C1/1407;;B64C1/143;;B64C1/143;;B64C1/1407,B64C1/14,244/129.5;;49/278,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Ignition systems. LUCAS (INDUSTRIES), Ltd., J. Sept. 8, 1952 [June 11, 1951], No. 13774/51. Class 7 (4). [Also in Group XXVI] An electrical system for automatically controlling the action of electric motors for driving the fuel and scavenging pumps and the ignition apparatus of a gas turbine used as a starter motor is shown in Fig. 1. On closing the switch k the electromagnet n of a cycle time mechanism is energized. The electromagnet energizes a spring which actuates a cam or other mechanism for operating switches o, p, q. The switch o is in series with the switch k and is opened by the mechanism immediately after the spring is energized. The operation of the switch k also energizes the electromagnet m which holds the push button closed and the electromagnet j which opens the switch i and closes the switch h. The fuel pump motor b then starts up. When the pressure at the discharge of the pump a reaches a predetermined value it acts on a diaphram t and closes the switches r, s. The switch s energizes the ignition apparatus e, f and the switch r the electromagnet u of a switch v with which is associated a time delay (not shown). If no ignition occurs in the combustion chamber, the switch v opens after a pre-arranged time interval and causes the electromagnets j, m, to release the associated switches. In the meantime the switch p will have closed and current will be supplied to the scavenging air pump motor d when the switch i is re-closed. Later the cycle-time mechanism completes its action, causing switches o, p, q to resume their initial positions. The apparatus is then ready for re-starting. If ignition occurs immediately the switch w operated by the pressure in the combustion chamber is closed and holds the system in operation until either the pressure in the combustion chamber falls and switch w opens or the switch q is opened by the cycle-time mechanism. Opening of either of these switches de-energizes the electromagnets j, m and releases the switches i, h, k. As the switch p has in the meantine closed, the motor d will be energized and will continue to run until the cycle-time mechanism opens the switch p and the system reverts to the condition shown. A switch y operated by a governor z driven by the turbine may be used to override the switches q, w, and opens when a predetermined speed is reached to cause the switch i to be closed and the scavenging pump to be started up. In a modification, the switch i is arranged separately from the switch h and is provided with a separate electromagnet under the control of the switch p in the cycle-time mechanism which is also provided with additional switches which control the electrical supply to the ignition apparatus and to an electromagnet controlling a throttle valve in the discharge of the fuel pump. In this arrangement, operation of the push button k causes scavenging air to be supplied to the combustion chamber and subsequently the throttle valve is opened for admitting fuel to the combustion chamber which causes the ignition apparatus to be energized.",LUCAS INDUSTRIES LTD,FLEMING WILLIAM;;LOXLEY MICHAEL JOHN,,https://lens.org/139-773-998-847-390,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,F02C7/264,F02C7/264,F1G G10B          G10B;;F1G G12           GZ;;F1G G18           GZ;;F1G G18           G10B,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A non-volatile flash store memory system for storing persistent data with low overhead. The flash store comprises an active flash memory sector and one or more non-active backup sectors. Each memory sector includes a header to indicate the status of the sector and multiple data records, each with their own headers. The data records are organized by key identifiers in combination with offset values to create a linked-list file structure. New records in the active sector can be sequentially added, while existing records can be marked as deleted if it is desired to remove them. Extra memory space can be recaptured by performing a compacting sequence, in which the active records are copied from the active sector to a backup sector, while skipping those records that are marked as deleted. Upon successful completion of the copying process the backup sector becomes the new active sector, and the former active sector is marked as inactive. The compacting sequence is performed so that there is always a valid copy of each data record at all times, and no data will be lost in the event of a power failure or other similar anomaly.

   A computer system that contains a boot signature checker is disclosed. In one example, the boot signature checker monitors the bus connecting the processor with the memory and provides a boot signature that is a function of the signal sequence detected on the bus. If an unauthorized user tampers with the operating system within the memory as when attempting to gain unauthorized access to presentable content such as television programming, the boot signature checker will in all probability produce a different boot signature than expected. The decrypter will respond to this different boot signature by, for example, deactivating thereby potentially preventing an unauthorized user from gaining access to presentable content.

A method of calibrating a gauge, e.g. a #-radiation gauge 42 for measuring basis weight or a moisture gauge 44 of the capacitance type, which monitors a property of a web 11, the gauge providing measurements of the property of a portion 62 of the web as the web travels along apredetermined path in the direction of its length, comprises cutting a sample from the portion 62 being measured whilst the web is moving, accurately measuring the property of the cut sample, comparing the property measurement obtained with that provided by the gauge on measuring the property of the portion from which the sample was cut, and then adjusting the gauge so as to reduce any differences between the two measurements. In the apparatus described for performing the method the cutter housing 40 is mounted on the same carriage as the gauges 42, 44 and may be moved transversely of the web 11 on rails 61 by motor 60. The gauges transmit signals to a recorder 50 including marking pens 52, 54.producing traces on a chart 55. A master programmer 56 determines the position of the gauges relative to the web. When it is desired to cut a sample a turner 64 generates a voltage pulse to energize a cutter actuator 66 which causes the cutter to enter the web and begin to cut a sample along lines 37. The cut sample is deflected by a tongue into a storage bag. The tuner 64 then removes the voltage pulse and the cutter withdraws from the web to end the sample. An R-C differentiator 70 may be employed to pulse the pen 52 or 54 as the cutter is energized and de-energized to indicate the part of the trace corresponding to the sample cut. Alternatively the pen corresponding to the gauge not being checked may be clamped to indicate the required part of the other trace. After the sample has been cut it is sealed in the storage bag and transported to a laboratory where the accurate measurement is made.",INDUSTRIAL NUCLEONICS CORP,FLEMING JOHN WILLIAM JR;;MCMULLEN JAMES MICHAEL,,https://lens.org/045-143-291-139-45X,Granted Patent,no,0,1,5,6,0,D21G9/0081;;G01N1/04;;G01N2001/2893,D21G9/00;;G01N1/04;;G01N1/28,G1A AFB           FB;;G1A AR1           4;;G1A A24Y          4;;G1A A241          4;;G1A A26X          4;;G1A A26Y          4;;G1A A263          4;;G1A A264          4;;G1A A269          4;;G1A A316          4;;G1A A35Y          4;;G1A A351          4;;G1A A36X          4;;G1A A36Y          4;;G1A A363          4;;G1A A364          4;;G1A A369          4;;G1A A407          4;;G1A A42Y          4;;G1A A421          4;;G1A A422          4;;G1A A423          4;;G1A A426          4;;G1A A428          4;;G1A A43Y          4;;G1A A431          4;;G1A A432          4;;G1A A433          4;;G1A A436          4;;G1A A438          4;;G1A A44Y          4;;G1A A441          4;;G1A A45Y          4;;G1A A451          4;;G1A A46Y          4;;G1A A461          4;;G1A A463          4;;G1A A467          4;;G1A A482          4;;G1A A489          4;;G1A A49X          4;;G1A A673          4;;G1A A681          4;;G1A A750          4;;G1S SAE           SAE;;G1S S1H           -;;G1S S1K           -;;G1S S4C           -;;G1S S7S           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Cutting samples. INDUSTRIAL NUCLEONICS CORP. 12 Dec., 1967 [12 Dec., 1966], No. 56475/67. Heading B4B. A method of cutting a sample from a web 11, Fig. 4, of material as it passes along a predetermined path in the direction of its length comprises moving a pair of convergent cutting edges 14, 15 through the web as it travels along the path so that as the edges move through the web, cuts 37, 38, Fig. 9, are formed which diverge from a first common point in the web, and then withdrawing the edges from the web so that the cuts converge to a second common point so severing a sample of the web from the remainder of the web between said cuts. In an apparatus for performing the method, the cutting edges 14, 15 are formed on crossed blades 12, 13 which are carried on a support 16, Fig. 4, which is mounted for vertical reciprocation under the control of an air cylinder 24 and piston 25. The support 16 also carries a tongue 32 which deflects the sample via a shoot 28 into a receptacle 35 releasably attached to the shoot. In other embodiments, the cutting edges are formed on a single cutter of inverted V-shape and may be mounted on a swingable arm instead of the vertically reciprocable support. The assembly including the blades 12, 13, support 16, and cylinder 24, may be mounted on rails so as to be movable transversely of the web thus enabling a sample to be taken at any position across the width of the web, or a sample to be taken which extends obliquely of the web. Instruments which measure characteristics of the web in the vicinity of the sample may be mounted on the rails for movement with the cutter assembly so that subsequent measurement of characteristics of the sample enables calibration of these instruments to be checked.",INDUSTRIAL NUCLEONICS CORP,FLEMING JOHN WILLIAM JR;;MCMULLEN JAMES MICHAEL,,https://lens.org/040-095-887-269-989,Granted Patent,no,0,0,5,6,0,D21G9/0081;;G01N1/04;;G01N2001/2893,D21G9/00;;G01N1/04;;G01N1/28,B4B B22F          -;;B4B B22Q          -;;B4B B29A          -;;B4B B29J2         -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The MTA queries a dynamic DMARC module (which can be implemented on a domain name system (DNS) infrastructure or the MTA) about any local policy override associated with the originating email domain. DMARC policy overrides can be published from a source system and stored locally to the dynamic DMARC module (e.g., on the DNS infrastructure or the MTA). The MTA receives a response which contains the local policy override published from the source system and dynamically overrides the fact that the email had failed DMARC. In this way, an email which failed DMARC can still be dynamically considered and delivered if a local policy override that is published from a source system indicates that it should be delivered.",PROOFPOINT INC,FRYBACK ALEXANDER SCOTT;;FLEMING JR ROBERT MICHAEL,PROOFPOINT INC (2020-03-27),https://lens.org/055-080-175-986-309,Patent Application,yes,0,3,5,5,0,H04L63/126;;G06Q10/107;;H04L63/20;;H04L51/212;;H04L61/4511;;H04L63/205;;H04L51/212,H04L29/06;;H04L12/58,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The multimedia system includes a conditional access manager which is a common interface between the multimedia system and a number of conditional access providers even if the conditional access providers follow different interface standards. In order to access a multimedia segment such as a television program, a radio program, or Web page, the multimedia system receives a request to access the multimedia segment. While accessing the multimedia segment, each of the conditional access providers is notified of the request through the conditional access manager. Each conditional access provider then determines whether permission to access the multimedia segment should be denied, or whether the conditional access provider does not know of any reason why permission to access the multimedia segment should be denied. Based on the responses from the conditional access providers, the segment is either displayed or blocked from being displayed.

    A method and system improve the detection of abnormalities, such as lung nodules, in radiological images using digital image processing and artificial neural network techniques. The detection method and system use a nodule phantom for matching in order to enhance the efficiency in detection. The detection method and system use spherical parameters to characterize true nodules, thus enabling detection of the nodules in the mediastinum. The detection method and system use a multi-layer back-propagation neural network architecture not only for the classification of lung nodules but also for the integration of detection results from different classifiers. In addition, this method and system improve the detection efficiency by recommending the ranking of true nodules and several false positive nodules prior to the training of the neural network classifier. The method and system use image segmentation to remove regions outside the chest in order to reduce the false positives outside the chest region.

Further improvement in the speed of killing is obtained when the virus of this invention also contains a nonfunctional egt gene to reduce feeding by the infected larvae, inhibit growth and further mediate the earlier death of the infected insect. A specifically exemplified faster-killing insect virus is the V-8 strain of AcMNPV. The faster killing phenotype is carried on a MluI to EspI fragment from 1.93 to 3.27 map units within the AcMNPV genome, and its sequence is provided herein as SEQ ID NO: 3 . . . V8vEGTDEL is the egt-inactivated derivative of AcMNPV V-8; the combination of the increased virulence of the V-8 genotype, for example, and the inactivation of the gene encoding ecdysteroid glycosyl transferase provides further improvement (as further decrease in time after infection until insect death). Additionally, such an Egt-deficient baculovirus may be still further modified to express a protein which affects ecdysis.
