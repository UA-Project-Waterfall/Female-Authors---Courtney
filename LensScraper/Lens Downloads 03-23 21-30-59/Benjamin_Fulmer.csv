A presente invenção refere-se a sistemas de segurança para equipamentos elétricos. Os sistemas de segurança incluem um sistema de detecção adaptado para detectar condições de perigo entre uma pessoa e uma parte operacional da máquina, tal como o contato acidental com a parte operacional, e um sistema de reação associado ao sistema de detecção, que faz com que uma ação predeterminada ocorra com relação à parte operacional quando uma situação de perigo é detectada pelo sistema de detecção. O sistema de detecção pode ser adaptado para transmitir capacitivamente uma carga elétrica para a parte operacional e detectar quando esta carga é reduzida. O sistema de reação pode ser um sistema de freios para parar a parte operacional, um sistema de retração para retrair a parte operacional, um sistema para encobrir a parte operacional, ou algum outro sistema. Os sistemas de segurança incluem outros dispositivos e elementos, como apresentado. Máquinas equipadas com sistemas de segurança também são apresentadas, como serras, desempenadeiras, e outras máquinas para trabalho em madeira. As máquinas apresentam uma parte operacional, como um cortador ou lâmina, um sistema de detecção adaptado para detectar condições de perigo entre uma pessoa e a parte operacional, e um sistema de reação associado ao sistema de detecção que faz com que uma ação predeterminada ocorra quando uma condição de perigo é detectada, como um sistema de freios para parar a parte operacional, um sistema de retração para retrair a parte operacional, ou um sistema para encobrir a parte operacional.
