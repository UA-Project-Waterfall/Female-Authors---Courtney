   The present invention relates to an ultra wideband wireless, voice-activated remote control device for controlling an electronic device having voice control circuitry. A short-range ultra wideband wireless data and voice communication link is established between the remote control device and the electronic device. To activate voice control circuitry in the electronic device, a user supplies an input to the remote control device. In response to the user input, ultra wideband wireless link circuitry within the remote control device sends a control signal via ultra wideband techniques, for example an AT command transmitted through the ether using ultra wideband technology, to the electronic device. The electronic device receives the control signal and transmits a control signal indicating the status of the electronic device. Once the voice control circuitry is activated, the user provides a voice command to the remote control device. The remote control device transmits the voice signal to the electronic device over the wireless communication link. The electronic device processes the voice signal in the voice control circuitry and generates instructions in response to the voice signal if recognized. The voice control circuitry is advantageously located within the electronic device and not within the remote control device to simplify the remote control device and to minimize the amount of power dissipated in the remote control device.

   A scanner for reading characters from a string of characters recorded on a surface as well as reading bar code information encoded in bar codes. Upon obtaining either the text or the bar code information, the information is transferred to a remote location via impulse radio wireless techniques. The character or bar code scanner may include a lens of variable magnification so as to accommodate variable size print. The scanner is in communication with an external information processing apparatus such as a computer through an impulse radio wireless transmitter/receiver. The value of each pixel detected by the scanner is determined by comparing the light reflection value with a threshold that is adjusted in accordance with the values of pixels detected and averaged over previous frames. The hand-held scanner and impulse radio transceiver and impulse radio antenna may be housed in any elongate housing for pen-like use or in a palm-held housing such as a typical mouse. The novel impulse radio wireless interface allows large data throughput while avoiding many traditional wireless shortfalls such as multipath and RF and optical interference. Distance determination by impulse radio means provides for varying the data rates of the communication between the impulse radio and a remote device based on said distance and allows for a warning that the distance from said remote device to said scanner is exceeding a predetermined limit.

Each scraper includes a flap of resilient material which is bent as it scrapes along the inclined beach surface. The aerator includes an aerator chamber (16) substantially sealed from the rest of the container except at its top, with the wastewater inlet opening to the chamber so bubbles are applied along the upwardly flowing stream of wastewater that flows up along the box into the rest of the container. The aerator includes a rotor (80) with hollow blades coupled to an air tube, with the tips (104) of the blades having holes opening in a substantially circumferential direction to better distribute the air bubbles. A plurality of plates (20) are positioned in the container (2) to form a lamellar structure over which the wastewater may pass, the plates being oriented to direct suspended solids in the wastewater to the surface of the wastewater and/or to sludge removal means (50) at the bottom of the container (2). The plates (20) are disposed in a spaced-apart parallel relationship, and are inclined upwardly at an angle to the horizontal, and adjustment means (21,22) are provided to alter the angel of the plates to the horizontal. The invention also includes a tertiary separation means comprising a rotary cylindrical screen (74) through which the wastewater is passed; and means (76) associated with the screen to remove sludge deposited on the screen to sludge receiving means (44). <Figure 1>",FINN GERARD JAMES,FINN PATRICK JOSEPH;;FINN GERARD JAMES,,https://lens.org/199-781-487-139-591,Patent Application,no,0,0,2,2,0,,B03D1/16,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The apparatus includes a container (2) for holding wastewater, an inlet (4) located at a lower portion of the container, and an aerator (14) adjacent to the inlet for generating air bubbles that cling to waste particles to bring them to the water surface. A skimming apparatus (30) which skims particles off the surface of the wastewater into a sludge receiver (44) includes a beach device (42) with an inclined upper surface (40), and a belt device (34) that moves a series of scrapers (32) along the surface of the water and along the beach device into the sludge discharge. Each scraper includes a flap of resilient material which is bent as it scrapes along the inclined beach surface. The aerator includes an aerator chamber (16) substantially sealed from the rest of the container except at its top, with the wastewater inlet opening to the chamber so bubbles are applied along the upwardly flowing stream of wastewater that flows up along the box into the rest of the container. The aerator includes a rotor (80) with hollow blades coupled to an air tube, with the tips (104) of the blades having holes opening in a substantially circumferential direction to better distribute the air bubbles. A plurality of plates (20) are positioned in the container (2) to form a lamellar structure over which the wastewater may pass, the plates being oriented to direct suspended solids in the wastewater to the surface of the wastewater and/or to sludge removal means (50) at the bottom of the container (2). The plates (20) are disposed in a spaced-apart parallel relationship, and are inclined upwardly at an angle to the horizontal, and adjustment means (21, 22) are provided to alter the angle of the plates to the horizontal. The invention also includes a tertiary separation means comprising a rotary cylindrical screen (74) through which the wastewater is passed; and means (76) associated with the screen to remove sludge deposited on the screen to sludge receiving means (44). <Figure 1>",FINN GERARD JAMES,FINN GERARD JAMES;;FINN PATRICK JOSEPH,,https://lens.org/180-378-839-101-715,Patent Application,no,0,0,2,2,0,,B03D1/16,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   Multiple dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) signals are superimposed on a single channel of a multiplexed signal in a coarse wavelength division multiplexing (CWDM) system. The DWDM signals may be superimposed on the CWDM spectrum in a metro area network that has legacy optical components that are otherwise designed for use with CWDM signals. This system increases the data transmission rates that can be achieved over an existing network that has less expensive CWDM optical components. The system also provides a scalable solution for increasing data transmission capacity in new networks.

A ring is provided for holding the seal in the correct position, and preventing a significant change in the shape of the seal in the direction of the outlet opening when an extrusion pressure is applied to the seal. The extrusion pressure is exercised by the check valve unit so that a part of the seal is extruded from the permanent shape to the temporary shape extending between the unit and other parts of the valve in the direction of the inlet opening, thus forming a liquid-tight seal between the inlet opening and the outlet opening. The displacement into the temporary shape effected by the unit is restricted so that the recovery characteristics of the polymer are not exceeded, the seal returning to its permanent shape when the unit is situated in its first position. The seal is pref. made of PTFE. Valve operates rapidly and exactly in cooperation with the pump of a liquid chromatography system, and does not effect the reliability of the pump during long operation periods. It resists contamination by residues obtd. from the pump, without requiring the provision of a filter.

By reducing the required capacity for an optical network from dual fibers to a single fiber, significant cost and bandwidth efficiencies are achieved. The systems and methods also provide redundancy protection in single-fiber bidirectional line ring systems. In the event of a downstream fiber or device failure, the OADM module receives a signal on a first wavelength from a first direction, shifts the signal from the first wavelength to a second wavelength, and sends the signal back down the fiber it originated from on the second wavelength, thus maintaining the propagation of the signal in the ring system.",FINISAR CORP,ALDRIDGE JAMES FINN;;LEVINSON FRANK;;ZHONG JOHNNY;;WANG STEVE,FINISAR CORPORATION (2004-08-02);;II-VI DELAWARE INC (2019-09-24),https://lens.org/013-146-981-824-895,Granted Patent,yes,5,2,2,3,0,H04J14/0294;;H04J14/0294;;H04B10/2589;;H04B10/2589;;H04J14/0216;;H04J14/0216;;H04J14/0227;;H04J14/0227;;H04J14/0241;;H04J14/0241;;H04J14/0283;;H04J14/0283;;H04J14/0291;;H04J14/0291,H04J14/02;;H04B10/00;;H04B10/24,398/83;;398/5,8,0,,,"U.S. Appl.

   A high temperature electrochemical system, such as a solid oxide fuel cell system, generates hydrogen and optionally electricity in a fuel cell mode. At least a part of the generated hydrogen is separated and stored or provided to a hydrogen using device. A solid oxide regenerative fuel cell system stores carbon dioxide in a fuel cell mode. The system generates a methane fuel in an electrolysis mode from the stored carbon dioxide and water by using a Sabatier subsystem. Alternatively, the system generates a hydrogen fuel in an electrolysis mode from water alone.

   The present invention provides tough, high modulus, low density thermoset polyurethane compositions which are useful in general as, for example, cast structural materials and in a preferred embodiment can be cured directly onto an aircraft engine fan blade, thereby providing a lighter blade, without concomitant loss in structural integrity or blade performance due to, for example, resistance to foreign object impacts and fuel efficiency. In a preferred embodiment, the composition is comprised of bis-amine compounds reacted with isocyanate-functional polyether polymers in the presence of hollow polymeric microspheres. The thermoset polymer compositions are formed by casting into a mold which is formed by a cavity within the metallic or composite fan blade or guide vane in the form of a pocket and a removable caul sheet. After the elastomeric polyurethane foam is injected through at least one injector port into the mold, the foam is cured.

The method monitors an application performance. The method categorizes a first subset of traffic of the network. The categories for the first subset include trusted, known to be bad, and suspect. The method determines an action for a second subset of traffic based on the category for the first subset of traffic. Some embodiments provide a system for adaptive networking that includes a first device and traffic that has a first subset and a second subset. The system also includes a first resource and a second resource for the transmission of the traffic.

A model training step generates a model by empirically obtaining measured signal waveforms corresponding to measured state parameters. Features, such as mode shapes and mode amplitudes, are extracted from the measured signals and stored in an estimation model along with coefficients of the model that correlate measured state parameters with the mode amplitudes. During part operation, the state parameters measured during operation are entered into the estimation model to obtain estimated features in a estimated signal waveform.

Reconfiguration commands sent to a management interface are intercepted and provided to a mitigation service executing in the customer environment. The mitigation service computes a risk rating for each such command based on a wide variety of factors. If the risk is low, then the mitigation service passes the command transparently to the management interface for execution. However, if the risk is too high, then the mitigation service requests an authorization code before the command can be executed. The acceptable level of risk may be set jointly by the customer and the managed service provider according to a service level agreement. Authorization codes can confirm performance of many mitigation actions, including approval by the customer or a supervising manager, studying relevant documentation, and clean execution of the command in a testing environment.",DELL PRODUCTS LP,LECA RUI;;O'MAHONY JAMES;;FINN JOHN;;MUNCHBERG FIONA;;NOONAN DENIS GERALD;;POWER BRIAN;;DREXLER BRIDGET;;KERRIGAN MARTIN;;OKEEFFE DEREK;;RAJA WAQAS,DELL PRODUCTS L.P (2020-07-29),https://lens.org/085-834-552-333-714,Patent Application,yes,5,0,1,1,0,G06Q30/0185;;G06Q30/0185,G06Q30/00,,1,1,051-788-956-603-233,10.1109/icse.2001.919098,"Wohlstadter et al.
