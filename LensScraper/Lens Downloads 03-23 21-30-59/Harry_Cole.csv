The terminals A, B are connected in the tail-light circuit, and current normally flows by the three-way switch D through the casing F and coils G of an electro-magnet to the opposite terminal B. When the current in the circuit fails, the armature J of the electromagnet is released and closes a circuit from the terminal No. 1 of the battery L through the switch D, casing F of the electro-magnet, contact-spring O, and lamp Q to the terminal 2. The lamp Q can be independently lighted by pressing the button T, which makes contact with an extension of the conducting-plate M connected with terminal 1.

Class 100(1) A collapsible spindle, for use in mounting a reel of paper in bearings, comprises a substantially cylindrical member 1 formed with a shoulder 2 having an inclined end face 5 at one end, a cap 3 slidably fitting over the other end and having an inclined annular end face 6 corresponding with the inclined face 5, means for preventing rotation of the cap on the cylindrical member, a plurality of curved sections 8 together forming a cylinder having inclined opposite end faces, means for resiliently holding the sections 8 in the recess formed between the annular end faces 5 and 6 of the shoulder and the cap, and a screwed spindle 15 for causing axial sliding movement of the cap on the cylindical member to apply end pressure on the sections to cause an outward radial movement of the sections. As shown, the cap 3 is prevented from rotating on the member 1 by a screwed pin 21 engaging a slot 23, while screwed pins 11 prevent rotation of the sections 8 on the member 1. The sections 8 are resiliently held in position by spiral springs 9 engaging annular grooves 10. The spindle 15 is located axially by a flange engaging the member 1 and a circlip 18, fitted in an annular groove 19, engaging a washer 20 abutting the member 1. The spindle 15 has a thread 16 engaging a corresponding thread 17 in the cap 3. The core, to be mounted at each end by one of the spindles, is prevented from rotating by a stop 24 on each of the spindles engaging a slot in the core.

The amplifiers 13 and 15 have feedback so as to operate as unity gain summing and subtracting amplifiers. With the switches S1A and S1B as shown adjustment of RV1 moves the centre threshold (C, Fig. 2, not shown), and adjustment of RV2 symmetrically expands the channel or threshold range by increasing the upper threshold and decreasing the lower threshold. With the ganged switches in position 2 asymmetric channel mode is obtained (Fig. 3, not shown), in which the low level threshold is set by RV1 and the channel width is set by RV2 which independently adjusts the high level. In the position 3 of these switches both the high and low level thresholds are adjustable independently by RV2 and RV1. A detector circuit (not shown) senses when the high level threshold is exceeded and when the low level threshold goes through zero and is arranged to provide a visual warning that the unit is operating outside the permissible range and also to inhibit output signals from the unit. The basic reference potentials from RV1, RV2 are obtained from a stabilized reference supply at 11.",ATOMIC ENERGY AUTHORITY UK,COLE HARRY ALBERT GEORGE,,https://lens.org/106-353-950-984-910,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G06G7/25,G06G7/25,H3P PPTE          PPTE;;H3T TE            TE;;H3T T2E           T1YD;;H3T T2F5          T1YD;;H3T T2J           T1YD;;H3T T2T3J         T1YD;;H3T T3E           T1YD;;H3T T3J           T1YD;;H3T T3V           TE;;H3T T3VX          T1YD;;H3T T4G           T1YD;;H3T T5P           T1YD,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The stoves such as A, usually have a hot chamber B at their upper part,openings C<1>, C' in the top upon which to place vessels, and a row of holes D for the escape of waste gases. The first device is an enclosure E, formed of ends e<1>, e', a bottom, and one side continued to form a top with a narrow groove e<3>. It is secured by bolts G passing through arms of the holes D. A grating F to carry saucepans &c. has flanges which rest on the top of the stove and within the groove. This device may be placed at the sides as well as at the back of the stove. The modification shown in Fig. 3 consists of a casing H forming a kind of hollow trivet. open at the front to receive heat from some of the holes D, and having a bottom, three sides, and a grating top. It is supported by means of two hooks I', P engaging in holes D, so as to be on or near the level of the top of the stove. The third device consists in supporting above the stove any cooking vessel or vessels, such as a removable oven and a removable boiler as shown in Fig. 8. The stove in this case is a large one, and has an extra top opening or openings J, above which is placed a grating K<1>. Over this is placed a jacketed oven L, having an opening l<4> at the top.

In one arrangement, a vessel V contains the plant material or animals, and their movements are detected by use of a light beam L from a source C, to display a speckle pattern on a screen S, the speckle pattern being inspected and measured to obtain movement information. Alternatively, the light beam L can be combined with a reference beam to give an interference pattern containing doppler frequencies indicative of organism movement. <IMAGE>",WRC PLC,TINKER MICHAEL HARRY;;COLE JOHN ALEXANDER,,https://lens.org/083-816-231-659-754,Patent Application,no,2,4,4,4,0,G01N15/0211;;G01N21/53;;G01N33/1866;;G01N2015/0216;;G01N2021/479,G01N15/02;;G01N21/53;;G01N33/00;;G01N33/18,G1A AA3           CEX;;G1A ACA           CAL;;G1A ACEX          CEX;;G1A AG17          CEX;;G1A AG18          CEX;;G1A AR7           CEX;;G1A AT2           CEX;;G1A AT22          CEX;;G1A AT3           CEX;;U1S S1275;;U1S S1289,1,0,,,WPI Abstract Accession No.85-165723/28 & DE 3345196A (SCHMIDT) 4/7/85,EXPIRED

The thread is advanced and washed on a thread-storage and advancing device such as a pair of canted driven rollers or a reel of two interdigitating sets of bar members as described in Specifications 413,413 and 413,414, [Group IX]. Drying is preferably effected on a separate thread advancing device. In an example, viscose is extruded at 1 into a coagulating bath 2 containing sulphuric acid, sodium sulphate and zinc sulphate at 48 DEG C. The thread is withdrawn with an acid carry-over of 5 per cent. and passed over a pair of canted rolls 30, 31, the surface of which is divided into two zones by steps 34, 35. The thread is maintained in the acid state in the first zone and washed with water at 20 DEG C. in the second zone. The apparatus is enclosed in a casing 13 to which steam is admitted at 15 to maintain the atmosphere within at 35 DEG C. and 90 per cent. relative humidity. The thread is withdrawn from the casing, lubricated at 22, dried on a pair of driven drums 26, 27 the upper of which is steam-heated, and collected on cap-twister 29. Stretching is effected as the thread passes over the steps 34, 35 and over the stepped ends 32, 33. In another example, the atmosphere in casing 13 is maintained at 40 DEG C. and 95 per cent. relative humidity, the surface of the thread advancing rollers being divided into two zones by a continuous circumferential groove. The thread is given a further lubrication after drying. The roller surfaces may also be divided into two zones by a band of non-wetting material as described in Specification 645,171.
