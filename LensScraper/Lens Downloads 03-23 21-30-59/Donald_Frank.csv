Automatic exchange systems. H.M. POSTMASTER GENERAL. 29 July, 1966 [29 July, 1965; 24 March, 1966], Nos. 32557/65 and 13101/66. Heading H4K. In a switching system control signals from a control register 15, Fig. 1 to a stage register 102 are sent as a unique combination of a number of discrete current or voltage valves applied one to each conductor of the transmission path. A receiver in the stage register signals to the transmitter when it is ready to receive a combination compares the incoming current or voltage valves with reference valves in order to identify the received values, and signals to the transmitter when a combination has been identified. D.C. voltage sender and receiver is shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4, and 5, in which the control register seizes the D.C. sender by operation of relay SA, Fig. 2, and transmits the first digit stored in the register as energization of one line out of each of the groups of four lines L25-28 and L211 to 214. Contact SA1 puts an earth on signal wire L23, which connects to L33 on Fig. 3, and operates relay BB which via BB1 puts 12V+ve signal on lines L31 and 32 which signal, via rectifiers MN35 and 36 and transistors VT32 and 33, operates relay CP to put the receiver in signal receiving condition, and is reverted to the transmitter as a ""proceed to send"" signal. The 12V signal received on lines L21-22 Fig. 2, turns on transistors VT21 and 22 which, via transistors VT23 and 24 operate relay SC, which holds over contacts SC4, and applies D.C. voltage signals to lines L21 and 22 over contacts SC1 and 2, the actual voltages applied to the lines depending on which of the relays A to D and W to Z are operated to switch through potentials from the Zener diode chains RZ22 to RZ211. The resulting D.C. potentials received on lines L31 and 32 are applied over operated contacts CP2 and CP3 to lines L41 Fig. 4, and L51 Fig. 5, for evaluation. In Fig. 4, the voltage received from the transmitter line L21 and applied via lines L31 L311 and L41 is compared with reference potentials of earth, V5, V6, and V7 in transistors VT41-VT44 and causes all the transistors to conduct whose reference potential, applied to the emitter, is less than the signal potential. The diode matrix MR411 to 420 is arranged to enable only that transistor of transistors VT45 to VT48 which is associated with the highest numbered operated one of the transistors VT41 to VT44, to cause operation and self hold of one of the relays AA to DA. In a similar fashion the voltage on line L22 is applied over lines L32, L321 and L51 Fig. 5, to cause operation of one of the relays WA to ZA. Contacts of the relays AA to DA and WA to ZA are arranged in a tree as shown on Fig. 3 to provide a selection signal for the common control circuits as a potential on one of the sixteen lines 1 to 16. A signal potential on one of lines 1 to 16 is fed, via one of the diodes MR311 to 326 to turn on transistor VT34 and operate relay SR. Contact SR1 earths line L32 and via line 22, Fig. 2, contacts SC2 and rectifier MR25 turns on transistors VT25 to 27 to operate relay SD. Contacts SD1 puts earth potential on line L29 to signal to the control register that the information has been sent, and received by the stage register, while contacts SD2 open to release the operated ones of relays A to D and W to Z to remove the signalling potential from the lines L21 and 22. SD1 over its back contact removes the hold signal from transistor VT24 and releases relay SC which causes SD to release. Finally VT49, Fig. 4 is turned on to operate relay RL to inhibit the detector circuits and prevent their operation on subsequent switching surges, SR releases when the output goes from the leads 1 to 16, and relay A is released by the control register to restore the equipment to its original condition. In a modification in which each transmitted signal comprises two successive digits sequencing circuits are provided at the transmitter and at the receiver, and a pair of temporary relay stores are provided to store the output from the detector circuits until both digits have been transmitted and the outputs from the stores operate the common control via a translation field. Current signalling sender and receiver shown in Figs. 7 to 12, operates in a similar manner to that described above with respect to Figs. 2 to 5 except that the information signals applied to the lines L71 and L72 are discrete values of current obtained by the switching, by means of relays A to D and W to Z controlled by the control register, of one of the resistors R81 to R84 into the emitter circuit of transistor VT81 and one of the resistors R85 to R88 into the emitter circuit of transistor VT82. At the receiver, after the initial setting up period which is identical with that described above, the coded current signals are fed from line L71, via L91 and contact CP2, to L105, Fig. 10 and from line L72, via line L92 and contact CP3 to L119, Fig. 11. In each current detector, Fig. 10 or Fig. 11, relays e.g. P, Q, R, and S, Fig. 10, are operated one after the other until the current fed to the detector circuit on L105 equals that fed via VT105 and controlled by the relay contacts P3 to S3. At the balance condition the number of relays P to S which are operated will depend on the incoming current and the interconnections of relay contacts P4 to S4 and rectifiers MR109 &c. will cause one only of transistors VT106 to 109 to conduct and mark one of the lines L101 to L104. The current in line 119 will similarly cause one of lines 115 to 118 to be marked and the combination marking in the relay matrix of Fig. 12, will cause one of the relays 1R to 16R to operate and mark one of the lines L1 to L16 leading to the common control. The release of the apparatus then proceeds in a similar fashion to that described with respect to Fig. 2 to 5. An alternative embodiment is described for the transmission and reception of successive pairs of information signals similar to that referred to above after the description of Figs. 2 to 5.",POST OFFICE,RIGBY DONALD FRANK,,https://lens.org/108-041-843-994-072,Granted Patent,no,0,0,5,6,0,H04Q3/42;;H04Q3/42,H04Q3/42,H4K KAC           KAC;;H4K K1A2          KAC;;H4K K1A2          K1Z;;H4K K1A5Z         KAC;;H4K K1A5Z         K1Z;;H4K K1A8          KAC;;H4K K1M4          -;;H4K K1M9          -;;H4T TBL           TBL,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

BRITISH AIRCRAFT CORP. Ltd. 26 June, 1970 [30 June, 1969], No. 32942/69. Heading H2A. An eddy current damping device e.g. for a gyroscope, comprises a permanent magnet rotor 10 with toothed polepieces 11 surrounded by a cylindrical, non-magnetic, conductive stator 14 having teeth formed by soft-iron bars 13 embedded therein. Relative angular movement between the stator and rotor produces eddy currents in the stator which give rise to an opposing torque and to increase the eddy currents, half the teeth on each polepiece 11 are phase-shifted by half a tooth pitch as shown in Fig. 3a so that when the teeth in Band I of a pole-piece are in register with the stator teeth 13, those in Band II are out of register therewith. Consequently for a given rate of displacement of the rotor, the major phase axis oscillates about the polar axis of the magnet as the bands of rotor teeth come into register with the teeth 13 so that the rate at which the lines of flux cut the damping member is higher than said given rate. The stator teeth may be formed as the polepieces of the permanent magnet or, alternatively, the stator and permanent magnet in Fig. 1 may be stationary and only the rotor teeth movable in the air gap.",BRITISH AIRCRAFT CORP LTD,MORTON DONALD FRANK,,https://lens.org/082-561-145-522-42X,Granted Patent,no,0,4,1,1,0,H02K49/043,H02K49/04,H2A AQC           QC;;H2A A1E2          A1E2,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A further advantage is that the video player generates very little heat from its electronic strobe light source and therefore requires minimal cooling.",EASTMAN KODAK CO,FRANK LEE FITZPATRICK;;KAISER DONALD FRANK,,https://lens.org/055-971-153-976-221,Patent Application,yes,3,0,6,6,0,H04N3/36;;H05B41/34;;H04N3/36;;H05B41/34,G03B27/72;;G03B15/05;;H04N3/36;;H04N5/253;;H05B41/34,H2H HLD49         49;;H2H H25G          49;;H2H H25Q          49;;H2H H7B           49;;H2H H71           49;;H2H H73           49;;U1S S2106;;U1S S2226,0,0,,,,PATENTED

SOLUTION: The surface of copper is suitably treated with an acidic peroxide adhesion promoting composition and then with alkaline treatment. A minute coarse chemical conversion applied surface is formed on the metal by the composition, the adhesiveness of the formed surface is remarkably increased as compared with an untreated metal surface, and hence the surface is appropriately combined with a polymeric material. Further, the increased adhesion is kept on the applied surface over a long period, and the possibility that an undesirable reaction takes place between the metal and material is reduced over a long period. By such a treatment, the intermediate layer is combined with a prepreg or a picture formable dielectric, for example, to form a multilayer printed circuit board.",MACDERMID INC,FERRIER DONALD;;DURSO FRANK,,https://lens.org/070-569-190-936-964,Patent Application,no,0,1,13,13,0,C23C22/52;;C23F1/18;;H05K3/383;;H05K3/4611;;H05K2203/0793;;H05K2203/0796;;H05K2203/124;;C23C22/52;;H05K2203/0796;;H05K3/4611;;H05K3/383;;H05K2203/124;;H05K2203/0793;;C23F1/18,C08J5/12;;B32B15/08;;C09J5/00;;C09J11/02;;C09J201/00;;C23C22/40;;C23C22/48;;C23C22/52;;C23C22/60;;C23C22/63;;C23C22/73;;C23F1/18;;H05K3/38;;H05K3/46,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The apertured closed-cell foam laminate comprises a layer of apertured closed-cell foam material positioned between and bonded to a substrate of woven aramid material and a substrate of aramid material of a lesser or equal grade. The thermal liner is appreciably non-moisture absorbent and provides high thermal insulation for its weight and thickness in comparison to prior art thermal liners. Accordingly, the overall weight of the garment is minimized, as is the movement-restricting effect of the liner. The non-absorbency of the thermal liner allows the liner to be positioned between the moisture barrier and the outer shell of the garment so that the liner does not restrict flow of perspiration moisture vapor from the wearer to the moisture barrier.

The small cylindrical streamlined structural assembly results in a very great reduction in drag resistance while it is being towed underwater at high speeds as compared to conventional sonar domes which must be an order of magnitude larger in diameter to accommodate the larger conventional scanning sonar transducers which are several wavelengths in diameter at the operating frequency. The enormous reduction in drag resistance and the novel method of deployment permits the described low-frequency lightweight sonar system assembly to be pulled through the water at very high speeds by small patrol craft or helicopters to achieve very effective long-range low-cost high-speed sonar surveillance of very large areas of the sea.",DELLORFANO JR FRED M;;MASSA DONALD P,MASSA FRANK;;MASSA DONALD P,MASSA DONALD P.

    A protective garment, such as a firefighting garment, that is relatively thin and light weight. The garment possesses relatively high resistance to liquid water absorption, yet also possesses relatively high moisture vapor transport characteristics when compared to conventional firefighting garments. The garment of the present invention includes an outer shell; a thermal liner positioned within the outer shell; a moisture barrier positioned within the thermal liner and a face cloth positioned within the moisture barrier. The thermal liner is batting, knit, spunlace, woven textile or other suitable construction of a high heat and flame resistant material (such as an aramid or PBI material, or combinations thereof) that is treated with a durable, water repellant finish to minimize liquid moisture absorption by the thermal liner. Despite the liquid moisture absorption resistance imparted onto the thermal liner by the finish, the thermal liner still retains excellent moisture vapor transport characteristics. By positioning the treated thermal liner between the outer shell and the moisture barrier, the moisture barrier is protected from damage due to excessive thermal heat from the ambient and from abrasion and wear caused by the outer shell. Additionally, by orienting the moisture barrier within the thermal barrier, the TPP (thermal protection property) of the garment is substantially increased. This allows for the reduction in the overall thickness and weight of the thermal liner throughout the garment.

The data may relate to at least one of an image, speech, handwriting and information representative of the shape of an object. A transformation is characterised in at least two parts, at least one part indicating a domain and at least another (functional) part indicating a value for a measure associatable with a specific domain or aspect thereof. The transformations are determined analytically and preferably without recourse to searching. The transformation coefficients are derived in linear time. The transformation coefficients are the result of a linear relationship between coding complexity and image size. The quantised fractal coefficients are holdable in a store or sendable over a transmission path and retrievable or receivable as appropriate and a representation or simulation of the data reproduceable therefrom. The set of transformations is determinable by at least squares approximation to the data. A method of forward processing of a fractal from its code includes deriving the fixed points of all the transformations needed for the fractal, forming a rounded approximation pixel for each point, and plotting said pixels as a finite approximation to the attractor of the fractal.

A baffle pot 12 prevents liquid in the pipe 11 from siphoning into the reservoir 3 and a thimble 17 in the bottom of the reservoir ensures that only a very small quantity of an old sample is ever left in the apparatus.

A transformation has at least one part indicating a domain and at least another (functional) part indicating a value for a measure associatable with a specific domain or aspect thereof.

The quantised fractal coefficients may be stored or transmitted and a representation or simulation of the data reproduced therefrom. The set of transformations is determinable by a least squares approximation to the data. A method of forward processing of a fractal from its code includes deriving the fixed points of all the transformations needed for the fractal, forming a rounded approximation pixel for each point, and plotting said pixels as a finite approximation to the attractor of the fractal.

The thermal liner is batting, knit, spunlace, woven textile or other suitable construction of a high heat and flame resistant material (such as an aramid or PBI material, or combinations thereof) that is treated with a durable, water repellant finish to minimize liquid moisture absorption by the thermal liner. Despite the liquid moisture absorption resistance imparted onto the thermal liner by the finish, the thermal liner still retains excellent moisture vapor transport characteristics. By positioning the treated thermal liner between the outer shell and the moisture barrier, the moisture barrier is protected from damage due to excessive thermal heat from the ambient and from abrasion and wear caused by the outer shell. Additionally, by orienting the moisture barrier within the thermal barrier, the TPP (thermal protection property) of the garment is substantially increased.

Automatic exchange systems. AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE & ELECTRIC CO. Ltd. 23 Feb., 1968 [3 March, 1967], No. 10285/67. Heading H4K. A trunk circuit Tc, accessible to a reed relay group selector and a Strowger group selector SS, is deemed unavailable by the reed relay group selector both when there is busy earth on the C-wire and when the C-wire carries negative voltage over the low resistance of the H relay of a forwardly testing Strowger switch. To discriminate these conditions in the interrogator/marker of the reed relay group selector the C-wires of a 20 line group are connected over contacts TS1 to TS20 to individual interrogators such as I1 employing transistors T1 to T5. If the interrogator finds busy earth on the C-wire the Zener diodes Z1, Z2 prevent cut-off of a normally conducting transistor T1, transistors T2 and T3 being and remaining cut-off. Normally conducting transistor T5 in consequence stays conductive and by holding earth on lead SL1 signals that the trunk is unavailable. If the interrogator finds 50 volts negative over the low resistance of a relay H in a Strowger switch, voltages of about 50 and 37 volts negative appear at the points L and M of the interrogator. The Zener diodes Z1, Z2 with trigger voltages of about 15 volts each consequently break down to cut-off T1 which switches on T2. The voltage at M switches T3 on but with T2 conducting diode D3 is back biased and T5 remains conducting to signal that the trunk is unavailable with earth on SL1. If the interrogator finds 50 volts negative over resistor R1 on the C-wire (trunk circuit idle), a voltage of about 27 volts negative appears at point L this being insufficient to cut-off T1 over the Zener diodes but causing T3 to switch on to cut-off T5, the consequent removal of earth from SL signalling that the trunk circuit is available. The free condition of the trunk is not signalled over lead SL1 if the associated primary/secondary link of the reed relay group selector is not available. Should the associated link be busy a transistor T4 is held conductive and backs off diode D3 to prevent the idle condition of the trunk reaching T5 to switch it off. Capacitance of the C-wire, since it needs time to charge after the removal of busying earth, may delay the interrogator in signalling the free condition of the trunk. A delayed response is also produced when the capacitance of the C-wire is fully charged to 50 volts negative over R1, the initial discharge of the C-wire into the interrogator causing it to respond as if the C-wire were subject to test from a Strowger selector.",POST OFFICE;;AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE & ELECT,RIGBY DONALD FRANK;;GRUNDY BRIAN,,https://lens.org/084-171-113-237-818,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H04Q3/0004,H04Q3/00,H4K KLS           KLS;;H4K K1A2          KLS;;H4K K1A5Z         KLS;;H4K K1A5Z         K1(P;;H4K K1A8          KLS;;H4K K1H25         -;;H4K K1J2B         -;;H4K K1R1          KLS;;H4K K1S1          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Ceramic-metal seals. LODGE PLUGS, Ltd. Oct. 31, 1952, No. 23508/53. Divded out of 26027/51. Class 36. [Also in Group XXVII] A surface discharge sparking plug or other igniter includes a pair of electrodes of a metal having a higher sintering or fusion temperature than that of copper oxide, an electric insulator separating said electrodes, and a continuous semi-conducting spark discharge path of copper oxide extending between said electrodes and intimately uniting the insulator therewith. In one arrangement, Fig. 1, the central electrode 11 is separated from the earthed electrode 12 by an insulator 10 which may be of ceramic material such as alumina, and the spark discharge path is formed by a layer 13 of copper oxide the active face of which is flush with the ends of the electrodes. In a modified arrangement, Fig. 2, the copper oxide layer 13 is formed on an insulating pellet 15 abutting the main insulator and a nickel-iron earthed electrode 14 is separate from but lies in contact with the plug body 16. The air gaps between the electrodes and insulator and the exposed surface of the latter are filled or coated with copper oxide which is fused or sintered at a temperature below the fusion or sintering temperature of the electrodes or ceramic insulating material. The copper oxide may be in either the cuprous or cupric form or may be a mixture of these, and may be applied by painting or spraying and adhesion and compacting obtained by heating above or preferably just below the oxide melting point of 1250‹ C. Control of the conducting properties of the oxide layer may be effected by adjustment of the sintering temperature and furnace atmosphere. Heating for five minutes at 1100‹ C. in an oxidizing atmosphere produces satisfactory results. The electrodes may be assembled on to the ceramic base after the copper oxide layer has been applied and fired, but it is preferred to assemble the electrodes on to the ceramic base before firing the copper oxide layer. The electrodes may be coated with copper before the firing operation to ensure more intimate contact.",LODGE PLUGS LTD,SAYERS FRANK MANNINGTON;;TURNER DONALD,,https://lens.org/131-873-715-739-54X,Granted Patent,no,0,10,1,1,0,H01T13/52,H01T13/52,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The garment possesses relatively high resistance to liquid water absorption, yet also possesses relatively high moisture vapor transpor t characteristics when compared to conventional firefighting garments. The garment of the present invention includes an outer shell; a thermal liner positioned within the outer shell; a moisture barrier positioned within the thermal liner and a face cloth positioned within the moisture barrier. The thermal liner is batting, knit, spunlace, woven textile or other suitable construction of a high heat and flame resistant material (such as an aramid or PBI material, or combinations thereof) that is treated with a durable, water repellant finish to minimize liquid moisture absorption by the thermal liner . Despite the liquid moisture absorption resistance imparted onto the thermal liner by the finish, the thermal liner still retains excellent moisture vapo r transport characteristics. By positioning the treated thermal liner between the outer shell and the moisture barrier, the moisture barrier is protected from damage due to excessive thermal heat from the ambient and from abrasion and wear caused by the outer shell. Additionally, by orienting the moisture barrier within the thermal barrier, the TPP (thermal protection property) of the garment is substantially increased. This allows for the reduction in the overall thickness and weight of the thermal liner throughout the garment.</S DOAB>",LION APPAREL INC,TAYLOR FRANK P;;ALDRIDGE DONALD,,https://lens.org/112-682-424-513-363,Patent Application,no,0,0,21,23,0,A41D13/00;;A62B17/003;;A41D31/085;;A41D13/00;;A62B17/003;;A41D31/085,A41D13/00;;A41D31/00;;A62B17/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The desulfurization system can use a bed characterization limit, a predetermined sulfur threshold or other metric to determine when the hydrocarbon desulfurization bed should be regenerated. The desulfurization system can include heat and air intakes and an air/sulfur purge outlet to allow for the removal of sulfur from the hydrocarbon desulfurization bed. Alternatively, the regeneration of hydrocarbon desulfurization bed may be performed in situ by a service technician by using a prebuilt appliance that is connected to the inlet and outlets of the desulfurization appliance. The prebuilt appliance heats and purges hydrocarbon desulfurization bed, in substantially the same manner as described just above, and captures the sulfur outside of the desulfurization system.",COMBINED EN LLC,ROHR DONALD FRANK;;VOGEL JOHN ANTHONY,COMBINED ENERGIES LLC (2014-02-13),https://lens.org/037-033-882-299-386,Patent Application,yes,0,4,7,15,0,H01M2008/1095;;B01D53/02;;B01D53/0462;;B01D2253/108;;B01D2257/302;;B01D2257/304;;B01D2257/306;;B01D2257/308;;B01D2259/40056;;B01D2259/40098;;H01M8/0675;;B01D53/0454;;H01M8/0618;;Y02E60/50;;H01M8/0675;;B01D53/0454;;B01D53/02;;B01D53/0462;;B01D2253/108;;B01D2257/302;;B01D2257/304;;B01D2257/306;;B01D2257/308;;B01D2259/40056;;B01D2259/40098;;H01M2008/1095;;H01M8/04097;;H01M8/0618;;H01M8/04007;;G05D23/1917;;G06Q10/06315,H01M8/06;;B01D53/04;;B01D53/14,95/11;;96/111,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Pallet trucks; loading vehicles. DURAMIN ENGINEERING CO. Ltd. May 7, 1963 [May 8, 1962], No. 17609/62. Headings B8E and B8H. A trolley for handling pallets or crates consists of a wheeled frame surmounted by one or more load-supporting members raisable by fluid pressure. The wheeled frame includes at least one longitudinal frame member comprising a horizontal yoke 12, Fig. 2, depending webs 13 and/or 14 (which support the axles 16 of wheels 15) and a flange 17, whilst the loadsupporting members each consist of or include an inverted-U-section element 19 which fits over the said frame member and has an inward flange 21 which co-operates with the flange 17 to limit the extent of load raising. The space enclosed between the yoke 12 and the element 19 provides a chamber 22 within which the fluid pressure raising means is housed. This means is preferably an inflatable tube 23 connected to a source of compressed air. The trolley of Fig. 1 (not shown) consists of two parallel longitudinal assemblies as in Fig. 2, bridged by cross-members to form a rectangular frame which also supports compressed air cylinders and valves to connect them as required to the tubes 23. In Fig. 3, the U-section loadsupporting members 18 do not surmount the wheel-carrying frame members 10, but lie beside them and accordingly have outward flanges 21 replacing the inward flanges 21 of Fig. 2. Fig. 4 shows a detail of a trolley movable in two perpendicular directions and employing two sets of wheels 15, 15a, either of which can be raised clear of the ground by pressurizing the table 23a or 23 of the other. Fig. 6 (not shown) depicts a modification in which the U-section load-supporting members carry L-shaped brackets. Two such parallel members, with their brackets facing inwardly, facilitate the handling of crates. Loading vehicles.-A vehicle platform, preferably equipped with rails 35 for the trolley wheels 15, can use the trolley to convey palletised or boxed loads from one end of the vehicle to the other and the lifting mechanism of the trolley used to lift such loads at the former end and deposit them at the latter end. Compressed air for charging the cylinders on the trolley may, in this application, be derived from the vehicle's own pneumatic pressure system.",DURAMIN ENGINEERING COMPANY LT,CHANTLER DONALD AVERY;;TIMMS EDGAR FRANK,,https://lens.org/083-651-563-688-647,Granted Patent,no,0,3,1,1,0,B62B3/0618,B62B3/065,B8L LCA           LCA;;B8L L24           LCA;;B8L L29           LCA;;B8L L44           LCA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In one embodiment, the real energy and reactive energy measures are provided as integer quantity inputs. Particularly, assume S = kVAh, P = kWh, Q = kVARh, and R = Residue. Respective registers store values of P, [2P + 1], Q, [2Q + 1], and the sum [P² + Q²]. Initially, the P, Q, and [P² + Q²] registers are set to zero, while the [2P + 1] and [2Q + 1] registers are initialized to 1. At the arrival of a P pulse, the value in the [2P +1] register is added to the [P² + Q²] register, then the P register is incremented by 1 and the [2P + 1] register is incremented by 2. Exactly the same steps are carried out subsequent to receipt of a Q pulse. A set of registers also is used to store the S and [2S + 1] data, and generation of the S pulses is determined as follows. After arrival of either a P or Q pulse, a trial subtraction of [2S + 1] is made from the [P² + Q²] register. If the subtraction does not cause an underflow, an S pulse is generated, the S register is incremented by 1, and the [2S + 1] register is incremented by 2. If the subtraction causes an underflow, the [P² + Q²] register is reset to its previous value, the other registers are not incremented, and no S pulse is generated.",GEN ELECTRIC,BULLOCK DONALD FRANK;;HARDY SAMUEL GRAHAM,,https://lens.org/178-857-281-911-896,Patent Application,yes,4,5,15,15,0,G01R21/1331;;G01R17/00;;G01R21/1331,G01R21/00;;G01R21/06;;G01R21/133,,1,0,,,"IEEE INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE 27 April 1989, WASHINGTON DC pages 98 - 102; TURNELL ET AL.: 'A Microprocessor-Based Three Phase Power Transducer'",EXPIRED

Impedance measurements. STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES, Ltd. Nov. 15, 1946, No. 33979. [Class 37] A ratio-arm assembly for an impedance bridge comprises two impedances connected in series, and an amplifier, one of the impedances being connected in a feed-back path associated with the amplifier. As shown in Fig. 3 the ratio-arm assembly comprises two impedances 13, 14, either of which may be resistive, reactive, or complex. A balancing amplifier 15 is indicated by the input grid 16 of the first valve and the output anode 17 of the last valve, one or more valve cathodes being indicated by the earthed cathode 18. The impedance 13 is connected to the input grid 16, and the impedance 14 is connected between the anode 17 and the grid 16 so as to feed back a proportion of the output voltage of the amplifier to the input. The oscillator 10 supplying the bridge is connected between the corner 2 and earth. The corner 1 of the bridge is substantially at earth potential as the input impedance of the balancing amplifier 15 is low. Since the output impedance is also extremely low any impedance connecting the corner 4 to earth will be substantially shortcircuited and will not affect the balance. An impedance connecting the corner 2 to earth has no effect since it shunts the oscillator 10. The impedance to be measured is connected between terminals 7, 8 and a known impedance 9 forms the arm 3, 4. Fig. 4 shows a bridge for automatic balancing. The detector is connected by means of a current transformer 19 having two primary windings 20, 21 in series with the arms 2, 3 and 3, 4. The secondary winding 22 is connected to an amplifier 23, the output of which is connected through a transformer 24 to a phase-sensitive detector 25. The windings 20, 21 may have the same number of turns and are wound so that currents I 2 , I 4 flowing towards the corner 3 produce aiding fluxes. The condition for balance is that I 2 +I 4 =O, which produces zero flux in the transformer core and therefore no voltage is applied to the amplifier 23. The range may be changed by changing the turns ratio, e.g. by providing the winding 21 with a number of tapping points or by changing the transformer 19 for another with a different ratio by means of a switch. The balancing amplifier 15 consists of two valves 26, 27 coupled by a blocking condenser 28 and grid leak 29. The anode circuit of the valve 27 includes the primary winding of an output transformer 35 tuned to the test frequency by a condenser 36. The control grid of the valve 26 is connected directly to the corner 1. The transformer 35 is so poled that the feed-back through the impedance 14 is negative. An oscillator 37 supplies a test wave at a frequency such as 800 cycles per second to the primary winding of a transformer 39 having four secondary windings. One secondary winding 40 is connected to the primary winding 42 of a transformer 43 through a phase-changing amplifier 41 which changes the phase by 90 degrees. The transformer 43 has three output windings, one 44 of which has an adjustable tap connected to the corner 2. A phase-sensitive rectifier 25 comprises two similar branches producing at terminals 49A, 49B voltages proportional to the in-phase and quadrature components of the bridge unbalance current. These voltages control the motors that make the balancing adjustments, or may be applied to voltmeters for indicating the balance. As shown, the bridge is arranged for measuring impedances with negative reactance. The impedance 9 is a pure resistance adjustable in relatively large steps for providing various ranges. The impedance 14 is also a pure resistance controlled by one of the motors. The impedance 13 comprises a fixed condenser 55 associated with a resistance 56 controlled by the other motor. This is connected between the corner 1 of the bridge and a tap on an inductance 57 connected between the corner 2 and earth. The impedance to be measured is connected between terminals 7, 8. For measuring an impedance with a positive reactance the impedances in the arms 1, 2 and 1, 4 are interchanged. If a pure resistance is to be measured the impedance 13 is replaced by a fixed resistance connected between the corners 1, 2, the elements 55, 56, 57 being omitted. In order to balance out any small reactive component the transformer 39 is furnished with an output winding 58 with an earthed centre tap and shunted by a potentiometer 59, the slider of which is connected to one contact of a two-way switch 54. When the switch is on this contact for measuring a resistance, the output of the amplifier 23 is supplied with a small quadrature current which may be adjusted by the potentiometer 59 to balance out the quadrature component of the unbalance current. The potentiometer 59 may be driven by the motor that drives the resistance 56, which is disconnected when a resistance is being measured. The amplifier 23 has a low input impedance of about 1 ohm and is shunted by a resistance 53 when the switch 54 is in the position shown. The impedance effectively connected between the terminal 8 and the corner 3 is thus kept very small so that the error produced by an admittance to earth from terminal 8 is negligible. If the unknown impedance has one terminal directly connected to earth the winding 20 and the unknown impedance are interchanged, the earthed terminal of the unknown impedance being connected to the corner 3. The winding 20 is screened to prevent any admittance acting across the unknown impedance. This arrangement is shown in Fig. 5. The winding 20 of the transformer 19 is surrounded by an inner shield 60 which screens it from the windings 21, 22 and from an outer earthed shield 61. A pair of terminals 62, 63 are connected to the winding 20 and the corner 3, terminals 7, 8 being short-circuited. A switch 64 in the position shown connects the inner screen 60 to the corner 2. The admittance between the two screens acts effectively to earth from the corner 2 and therefore has no effect on the balance. To revert to the arrangement shown in Fig. 4, the short-circuit between the terminals 7, 8 is removed, terminals 62, 63 are short-circuited, and the switch 64 is moved to the other position to connect the inner screen 60 to earth. The primary winding 21 of the transformer 19 may be omitted and the impedance 9 connected to the terminal of the winding 20 which is connected to the terminal 8. The transformer is then outside the bridge network and the resistance 53 may be connected across the primary winding 20 instead of across the secondary winding 22. This may then be wound to step up to the input impedance of the amplifier 23. If it is desired to employ unequal currents in the two arms of the bridge, one or more intermediate taps may be provided on the primary winding 20 and the impedance 9 and terminal 8 may be connected to different taps so that the winding acts as an auto-transformer. When a single primary winding is used with one or more taps, the resistance 53 may be connected across that part of the winding which is outside the bridge.",STANDARD TELEPHONES CABLES LTD,MOODY NORMAN FRANK;;MCCALLUM DONALD MURDO,,https://lens.org/002-560-521-575-271,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,G01R27/02,G01R27/02,G1U UJC5          UJC5;;G1U U9A1          LA;;G1U U9A11         LA;;G1U U9A2          LA;;G1U U9B1C         LA;;G1U U9B1D         LA;;G1U U9B2D         LA;;G1U U9B2E         LA;;G1U U9B2F         LA;;G1U U9B2G         LA;;G1U U9B2H         LA;;G1U U9B2K         LA;;G1U U9B2X         LA;;G1U U9D1A         LA;;G1U U9D2          LA;;G1U U9F1          LA;;G1U U9F10         LA;;G1U U9F12         LA;;G1U U9F16         LA;;G1U U9F3          LA;;G1U U9F7          LA;;G1U U9F9B         LA;;G1U U9GX          LA;;G1U U9G2          LA;;G1U U9H1          LA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    The invention is directed to a method of fueling gas turbines from natural gas reserves with relatively low methane concentrations. The invention uses such reserves to generate electric power. The invention permits the use of these reserves at significantly lower cost than by producing pipeline natural gas to fuel gas turbines to generate electric power. These reserves currently generally are used only after the removal of impurities to produce pipeline natural gas quality turbine fuel. The latter current technology is capital intensive, and at current natural gas prices, economically unattractive. The process of the invention can remove the impurities from the gas from the natural gas reserve necessary for protection of the environment, and leaves inert gasses in the fuel in an amount which will increase the output of a gas turbine for the generation of power by about 5 to about 20%.

A listener component receives a notification in a network format suitable for transmitting the notification over a network. The listener component translates the notification into an internal processing format used by the notification service. The notification is then forwarded to a routing component that determines a category associated with the notification, and performs a set of one or more operations on the notification based on its category. Finally, the notification service is forwarded to a delivery service for delivery of the notification to the notification sink. The listener component, the routing component, and the delivery component may each be scaled in order to adjust for current processing loads using load balancing functionality.

   A diagnostic program can check the security of a program. The program is stored at predetermined non-relocatable physical address in memory. The diagnostic program is loaded and checks the program at the predetermined physical address against a standard. The diagnostic program then indicates that the program is verified as secure if it meets the standard or non-verified as secure if it does not meet the standard. If the program is not verified as secure, then the diagnostic program may take remedial action such as disabling normal operation of the program, be transmitting a predetermined message via the system modem or downloading another copy of the program via the modem. The program is made non-relocatable using a special table look-aside buffer having a fixed virtual address register and a corresponding fixed physical address register.

   The invention is directed to a method of fueling gas turbines from natural gas reserves with relatively low methane concentrations. The invention uses such reserves to generate electric power. The invention permits the use of these reserves at significantly lower cost than by producing pipeline natural gas to fuel gas turbines to generate electric power. These reserves currently generally are used only after the removal of impurities to produce pipeline natural gas quality turbine fuel. The latter current technology is capital intensive, and at current natural gas prices, economically unattractive. The process of the invention can remove the impurities from the gas from the natural gas reserve necessary for protection of the environment, and leaves inert gasses in the fuel in an amount which will increase the output of a gas turbine for the generation of power by about 5 to about 20%.

Preferably the mole ratio range of the titanium chloride to the alkyl aluminium compound is between 2:1 and 1:2 and the preferred titanium chloride is the trichloride and the preferred aluminium compound is aluminium triethyl. Preferably the titanium chloride is ground in an inert atmosphere prior to use. Generally 0,002 to 0,02 g. of catalyst are used for each gram of propylene to be polymerized. The catalyst components can be premixed and if desired heated to the polymerization temperature, and then added to the polymerization reactor, or they can be added simultaneously to the reactor in separate streams, the titanium component preferably being added as a slurry in the solvent to be used in the polymerization. The premixing is generally carried out in the solvent that is to be used in the polymerization reaction. The polymerization pressure is preferably in the range 0,07 to 70 atmospheres. The effluent from the polymerization reactor, comprising a slurry consisting of the hydrocarbon solvent, dissolved propylene polymer, dissolved unreacted propylene and the catalyst residues, is preferably passed to a flash tank to flash off the unreacted propylene. The silica gel can be added under pressure in the flash vessel simultaneously with the flashing operation, or after the flashing operation the slurry can be passed to a vessel to which the silica gel is added under pressure, e.g. under the pressure of an inert gas. The slurry containing silica gel is filtered at a temperature sufficient to keep the polymer in solution and at a pressure sufficient to keep the solvent liquid, e.g. 90 DEG to 180 DEG C. and 7 to 35 atmospheres and the dissolved polymer is recovered from the filtrate.",GRACE W R & CO,MIRABILE FRANK A;;HOEG DONALD F,,https://lens.org/151-861-646-721-123,Granted Patent,no,0,5,2,3,0,C08F6/02,C08F6/02,C3P PHX           PHX,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

An oxide etch protective layer of silicon nitride is selectively formed on a first portion of the pad oxide layer so as to overlie a first surface portion of the silicon substrate in which active device regions will be introduced. A second oxide layer is then deposited on the pad oxide layer and on the nitride layer. The dual oxide layer is then patterned to form a trench mask which exposes a second surface portion of the silicon substrate. An etchant is then applied to the structure so as to etch away material from the silicon substrate exposed by the second surface portion and a portion of the second oxide layer, thereby forming a trench in the second surface portion of the silicon substrate. After any remaining portion of the second oxide layer is removed, local oxidation of the structure is perfomed so as to form a third oxide layer in the trench and a field oxide at surface portions of the substrate adjacent to the nitride layer. A layer of polysilicon is non-selectively deposited over the entire structure to fill the oxide-lined trench and then polished down to the nitride layer which serves as a polishing stop. The nitride is then stripped off the pad oxide in preparation for device region processing.",HARRIS CORP,GAUL STEPHEN JOSEPH;;HEMMENWAY DONALD FRANK,,https://lens.org/165-241-115-364-842,Patent Application,yes,3,0,2,2,0,H01L21/32;;H01L21/763;;H01L21/32;;H01L21/763,H01L21/32;;H01L21/763,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The invention uses such reserves to generate electric power. The invention permits the use of these reserves at significantly lower cost than by producing pipeline natural gas to fuel gas turbines to generate electric power. These reserves currently generally are used only after the removal of impurities to produce pipeline natural gas quality turbine fuel. The latter current technology is capital intensive, and at current natural gas prices, economically unattractive. The process of the invention can remove the impurities from the gas from the natural gas reserve necessary for protection of the environment and leaves inert gasses in the fuel in an amount which will increase the output of a gas turbine for the generation of power by about 5 to about 20%.",EXXONMOBIL UPSTREAM RES CO,MITTRICKER FRANK F;;VICTORY DONALD J,,https://lens.org/073-188-506-462-719,Granted Patent,no,0,0,36,36,0,C10L3/06;;C10L3/08;;F02C3/22;;F25J3/0209;;F25J3/0233;;F25J3/0266;;F25J2200/02;;F25J2200/70;;F25J2270/90;;Y02C20/40;;F25J3/0209;;F25J2270/90;;C10L3/06;;F25J3/0233;;F02C3/22;;C10L3/08;;F25J3/0266;;F25J2200/02;;F25J2200/70;;Y02C20/40,C10L3/06;;C10L3/08;;F02C3/22;;F25J3/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The invention permits the use of these reserves at significantly lower cost than by producing pipeline natural gas to fuel gas turbines to generate electric power. These reserves currently generally are used only after the removal of impurities to produce pipeline natural gas quality turbine fuel. The latter current technology is capital intensive, and at current natural gas prices, economically unattractive. The process of the invention can remove the impurities from the gas from the natural gas reserve necessary for protection of the environment and leaves inert gasses in the fuel in an amount which will increase the output of a gas turbine for the generation of power by about 5 to about 20%.",MITTRICKER FRANK F.;;VICTORY DONALD J.,MITTRICKER FRANK F;;VICTORY DONALD J,,https://lens.org/198-968-179-571-036,Patent Application,yes,43,0,36,36,0,C10L3/06;;C10L3/08;;F02C3/22;;F25J3/0209;;F25J3/0233;;F25J3/0266;;F25J2200/02;;F25J2200/70;;F25J2270/90;;Y02C20/40;;F25J3/0209;;F25J2270/90;;C10L3/06;;F25J3/0233;;F02C3/22;;C10L3/08;;F25J3/0266;;F25J2200/02;;F25J2200/70;;Y02C20/40,C10L3/06;;C10L3/08;;F02C3/22;;F25J3/02,585/500,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A tool for working refractories for furnace linings, brick, concrete, asphalt paving, marble, granite, slate, ceramics, plastics &c., comprises a generally cylindrical body of a matrix material adapted to be rotated about the axis of the cylinder, the body having an integral ridge of the matrix material extending around its periphery, and cutting diamond material embedded in the ridge to provide, upon rotation of the body, a continuous cutting edge over the axial extent of the helical ridge. A hub 12, Fig. 4, e.g. of steel, having an internal keyway 14 and external ribs has a generally cylindrical matrix body 16 cast on its periphery. The body 16 has a multi-start helical ridge 22 in which are embedded single relatively large pieces of cutting diamond 21, Fig. 6, so spaced along the ridge as to provide axial overlap. Alternatively, the ridge may be impregnated with small diamond grits. The end faces 27 of the matrix body lie on a helix of the same inclination as the ridge 22. Two end faces 27 each extend 180 degrees round the matrix body, lie substantially midway between adjacent turns of the ridge and terminate in inwardly extending shoulders 28 lying on a common diametral plane. A number of tools may be assembled on a driving shaft 10, Fig. 2, and secured by a key 14. Spacers 20 ensure continuity of the ridges of adjacent tools. Workpieces C, Fig. 1, are secured to a table D which moves them under the tool assembly A rotated in a frame E. Coolant supplied to the tool and workpieces passes around the helical space between the turns of the ridge to flush cuttings therealong and clean and cool the ridge and the cutting diamond material mounted therein. When single pieces are used, the tool is rotated at milling cutter speed and not at grinding wheel speed.",CHRISTENSEN DIAMOND PROD CO,CHRISTENSEN FRANK LANGTON;;MABEY DONALD HARRY,,https://lens.org/008-563-389-190-711,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,B24D5/066;;B28D1/186,B24D5/06;;B28D1/18,B3D D1D4A1        -;;B3D D2E1          -;;B3D D2G3A         -;;B3D D2G3E         -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The invention permits the use of these reserves at significantly lower cost than by producing pipeline natural gas to fuel gas turbines to generate electric power. These reserves currently generally are used only after the removal of impurities to produce pipeline natural gas quality turbine fuel. The latter current technology is capital intensive, and at current natural gas prices, economically unattractive. The process of the invention can remove the impurities from the gas from the natural gas reserve necessary for protection of the environment and leaves inert gasses in the fuel in an amount which will increase the output of a gas turbine for the generation of power by about 5 to about 20%.",EXXONMOBIL UPSTREAM RES CO,MITTRICKER FRANK F;;VICTORY DONALD J,EXXONMOBIL UPSTREAM RESEARCH COMPANY (2005-09-21),https://lens.org/039-381-431-328-09X,Granted Patent,yes,2,0,36,36,0,C10L3/06;;C10L3/08;;F02C3/22;;F25J3/0209;;F25J3/0233;;F25J3/0266;;F25J2200/02;;F25J2200/70;;F25J2270/90;;Y02C20/40;;F25J3/0209;;F25J2270/90;;C10L3/06;;F25J3/0233;;F02C3/22;;C10L3/08;;F25J3/0266;;F25J2200/02;;F25J2200/70;;Y02C20/40,C10L3/06;;C10L3/08;;F02C3/22;;F25J3/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The invention uses kinematic principles to hold the object. Here a 2-2-2 kinematic bipod system is employed. The invention uses three actuators 5 to position the object. Each actuator acts as a bipod restricting the object in two of its six degrees of freedom. Each actuator has three degrees of freedom it can transmit to the object. The actuator can rotate on its single-axis flexure 7 so that the actuator can rotate on one axis relative to support 4. Each actuator has a two-axis coincident flexure 8 on one end for allowing the object to be moved in two rotational degrees of freedom and the roller sleeve 50 allows a third rotational degree of freedom. Each actuator is positioned circumferencially about the central coordinate axis of the object to be moved, 120 degrees apart. Each actuator is powered by a stepper motor 6 which drives the differential roller screw accurately, providing translational movement to the system in the shortest length possible.

A coin inserted in a slot n, in a raised part B of the casing depresses the adjustable extremity k<4> of the lever k, thereby raising the other extremity k<5> and permitting a ball to pass from the ball shoot on to the plunger f<1>; the plunger is raised by a forked lever o<2> on a spring-controlled shaft o operated from a handle o<1>; a dash-pot controls the returns of the plunger. The tube f in which the plunger works is closed by a hinged cover e. A gate u<1> on a spring u engaging a recess in the plunger prevents a, second ball from entering the tube when the plunger is in the raised position. The rotation of the shaft o also serves to set a delivery slide q<1> in position to deliver a check, a projection o<7> on the-shaft operating a spring-controlled rod q connected to the delivery slide, which is retained in the set position by a spring-controlled ietent q<3> ; a ball entering the opening d trips the detent q<3>, whereupon a check is delivered and a signal bell s is struck by a hammer s<1> operated by a pin s<2> on the rod q. A projection t<2> on a rod t operated from the shaft o holds up a winning ball in the channel j<2> until the shaft has been allowed to return to the normal position. In the modified form of the table, Fig. 4, the opening l is dispensed with, and the game is made more difficult by fixing a ball or other object w between the openings c, d; the surface of the table is made convex, so that a ball that fails to enter -the opening d rolls to the side of the table and falls through an aperture v. Pockets may be made in the side of the table.",ROBERTSON GEORGE DONALD;;SMITH FRANK ALFRED,ROBERTSON GEORGE DONALD;;SMITH FRANK ALFRED,,https://lens.org/046-357-999-196-644,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,G07F17/3297,G07F17/38,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Each actuator acts as a bipod restricting the object in two of its six degrees of freedom. Each actuator has three degrees of freedom it can transmit to the object. The actuator can rotate on its single-axis flexure 7 so that the actuator can rotate on one axis relative to support 4. Each actuator has a two-axis coincident flexure 8 on one end for allowing the object to be moved in two rotational degrees of freedom and the roller sleeve 50 allows a third rotational degree of freedom. Each actuator is positioned circumferencially about the central coordinate axis of the object to be moved, 120 degrees apart.

The body of the roller is of structurally sound construction, often solid, being plated with a hard, durable material such as chrome. The chrome is subjected to a specific plating, etching, and polishing process for producing an array of interconnected, shallow cracks and smooth, segrated lands thereupon. The cracked cylindrical surface of the roller then presents a plurality of smooth, unconnected lands to fluids dispersed thereon. Similarly, the interconnected crack pattern permits lateral flow of fluid between lands to reduce the surface tension and improve fluid transfer characteristics. In this manner, the roller may be used in any number of applications in conjunction with fluid supply means and deposit area.

The electrode 4 is connected to the cable under test whereas electrodes 5 are connected to earth through leakage current measuring instruments 6 shunted by spark gaps 7. Water from a reservoir 10 is circulated through the column 2 by a pump 11, this water passing through an ion-exchange device 12 in which it is de-ionized. The water may also flow through a by-pass 15, the quantities of water flowing through the device 12 and by-pass 15 being regulated by valves 13, 17. The discharge of the cable under test as indicated by the instruments 6 may be increased by introducing into the water a contaminant to reduce its electrical resistance. The contaminant is preferably a saline solution and is introduced into the by-pass 15 by a pumping dosing meter 16. Thus, by adjusting the valves 13, 17 the resistance of the water as indicated by conductivity cells 18, 19 may be brought to a desired value.

Complete disconnection of the hose coupling requires two separate rotational movements of the coupling halves relative to each other, and if there is pressure on the hose, the coupling halves will be pushed apart after completion of the first rotation step and the telltale warning will be produced by high pressure discharge through the vent opening as the coupling halves are pushed apart. In a preferred embodiment, the hose coupling includes a female member having a pair of inwardly directed, oppositely disposed segmental lugs and a male member having first and second pairs of outwardly projecting, oppositely disposed segmental flanges adapted to overlap and slidably engage behind the segmental lugs when the tubular sidewall portion is inserted into the receptacle and the members are rotated relative to each other. The first and second pair of flanges are axially spaced and angularly displaced with respect to each other, and a vent opening is formed in the tubular sidewall portion which is sealed by the female member when the tubular sidewall portion is fully inserted, and which is unsealed to permit fluid discharge into the interior of the receptacle as the tubular sidewall portion is withdrawn from the position of sealing engagement toward the safety stop position.",JENTSCH DONALD G;;ARDOIN FRANK L,JENTSCH DONALD G;;ARDOIN FRANK L,,https://lens.org/050-964-712-345-77X,Granted Patent,yes,10,29,1,1,0,F16L37/252;;F16L37/252;;F16L35/00;;F16L35/00;;Y10S285/924,F16L35/00;;F16L37/252,F2G G4G           G4G,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The invention uses such reserves to generate electric power. The invention permits the use of these reserves at significantly lower cost than by producing pipeline natural gas to fuel gas turbines to generate electric power. These reserves currently generally are used only after the removal of impurities to produce pipeline natural gas quality turbine fuel. The latter current technology is capital intensive, and at current natural gas prices, economically unattractive. The process of the invention can remove the impurities from the gas from the natural gas reserve necessary for protection of the environment and leaves inert gasses in the fuel in an amount which will increase the output of a gas turbine for the generation of power by about 5 to about 20%.",EXXON CHEMICAL PATENTS INC,MITTRICKER FRANK F;;VICTORY DONALD J,,https://lens.org/109-693-154-076-671,Granted Patent,no,0,0,36,36,0,C10L3/06;;C10L3/08;;F02C3/22;;F25J3/0209;;F25J3/0233;;F25J3/0266;;F25J2200/02;;F25J2200/70;;F25J2270/90;;Y02C20/40;;F25J3/0209;;F25J2270/90;;C10L3/06;;F25J3/0233;;F02C3/22;;C10L3/08;;F25J3/0266;;F25J2200/02;;F25J2200/70;;Y02C20/40,C10L3/06;;C10L3/08;;F02C3/22;;F25J3/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The invention permits the use of these reserves at significantly lower cost than by producing pipeline natural gas to fuel gas turbines to generate electric power. These reserves currently generally are used only after the removal of impurities to produce pipeline natural gas quality turbine fuel. The latter current technology is capital intensive, and at current natural gas prices, economically unattractive. The process of the invention can remove the impurities from the gas from the natural gas reserve necessary for protection of the environment, and leaves inert gasses in the fuel in an amount which will increase the output of a gas turbine for the generation of power by about 5 to about 20%.",EXXONMOBIL UPSTREAM RES CO,MITTRICKER FRANK F;;VICTORY DONALD J,EXXONMOBIL UPSTREAM RESEARCH COMPANY (2005-02-16),https://lens.org/171-248-903-024-223,Granted Patent,yes,40,107,36,36,0,C10L3/06;;C10L3/08;;F02C3/22;;F25J3/0209;;F25J3/0233;;F25J3/0266;;F25J2200/02;;F25J2200/70;;F25J2270/90;;Y02C20/40;;F25J3/0209;;F25J2270/90;;C10L3/06;;F25J3/0233;;F02C3/22;;C10L3/08;;F25J3/0266;;F25J2200/02;;F25J2200/70;;Y02C20/40,C10L3/06;;C10L3/08;;F02C3/22;;F25J3/02,60/772;;60/780;;60/39.465,1,0,,,"Brooks, Frank J., ""GE Gas Turbine Performance Characteristics"", GE Power Systems, Schenectady, NY, GER-3567H, Oct., 2000.",EXPIRED

At the beginning of life of the fuel cell, reactant processing module can operate on full cathode recirculation. As the fuel cell begins to age and become less efficient, the amount of nitrogen-heavy, vitiated air from the fuel cell cathode can be monitored by a control system and restricted using a valve. In order to compensate for the aforementioned restriction, the rate of input of the external air supply is increased to the HASR and the deficit in water is supplied in liquid form from a water reservoir and turned to steam within the HASR. The amount of liquid water input from the water reservoir that meets the need for continued efficient operation is relatively small.",COMBINED EN LLC,ROHR DONALD FRANK;;VOGEL JOHN ANTHONY,COMBINED ENERGIES LLC (2014-05-27),https://lens.org/023-436-009-645-318,Patent Application,yes,6,3,7,15,0,H01M2008/1095;;B01D53/02;;B01D53/0462;;B01D2253/108;;B01D2257/302;;B01D2257/304;;B01D2257/306;;B01D2257/308;;B01D2259/40056;;B01D2259/40098;;H01M8/0675;;B01D53/0454;;H01M8/0618;;Y02E60/50;;H01M8/0675;;B01D53/0454;;B01D53/02;;B01D53/0462;;B01D2253/108;;B01D2257/302;;B01D2257/304;;B01D2257/306;;B01D2257/308;;B01D2259/40056;;B01D2259/40098;;H01M2008/1095;;H01M8/04097;;H01M8/0618;;H01M8/04007;;G05D23/1917;;G06Q10/06315,H01M8/06;;H01M8/04,429/415;;429/423,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The free upper end of the rod extends above the support plate. A crossbar with ends of magnetically permeable material is secured to the free end of the rod and is caused to oscillate by a magnetic drive coil adjacent one end of the crossbar. Prior to mounting of the crossbar, the assembly is subjected to a specific heat treating schedule. A magnetic detector coil adjacent the other end of the crossbar detects the angular oscillation of the rod. Circuitry connected to the coils maintains the amplitude of oscillation of the rod constant. When the tip is immersed in a fluid, the power supplied to the drive coil is determined by the circuit and is a measure of the viscosity-density product of the fluid.

The imagewise exposure is through a stencil, or a negative or positive transparency (halftone or line). The process, for example, includes placing a photocurable liquid polymer layer between two sheets, at least one of which is transparent, exposing the laminate to actinic or UV radiation through a negative image, and separating the sheets. Depending upon the system, a positive image is formed on the sheet proximate the light source and a negative image on the other sheet, or vice versa. The two sheets have different adhesive forces for cured and uncured photoadhesive compositions, which accounts for the adhesion of the cured and uncured to different sheets.

The invention uses such reserves to generate electric power. The invention permits the use of these reserves at significantly lower cost than by producing pipeline natural gas to fuel gas turbines to generate electric power. These reserves currently generally are used only after the removal of impurities to produce pipeline natural gas quality turbine fuel. The latter current technology is capital intensive, and at current natural gas prices, economically unattractive. The process of the invention can remove the impurities from the gas from the natural gas reserve necessary for protection of the environment and leaves inert gasses in the fuel in an amount which will increase the output of a gas turbine for the generation of power by about 5 to about 20%.",EXXONMOBIL CHEM PATENTS INC,MITTRICKER FRANK F;;VICTORY DONALD J,,https://lens.org/016-850-868-386-799,Amended Patent,no,0,0,36,36,0,C10L3/06;;C10L3/08;;F02C3/22;;F25J3/0209;;F25J3/0233;;F25J3/0266;;F25J2200/02;;F25J2200/70;;F25J2270/90;;Y02C20/40;;F25J3/0209;;F25J2270/90;;C10L3/06;;F25J3/0233;;F02C3/22;;C10L3/08;;F25J3/0266;;F25J2200/02;;F25J2200/70;;Y02C20/40,C10L3/08;;C10L3/06;;F02C3/22;;F25J3/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The free upper end of the rod extends above the support plate. A crossbar with ends of magnetically permeable material is secured to the free end of the rod and is caused to oscillate by a magnetic drive coil adjacent one end of the crossbar. Prior to mounting of the crossbar, the assembly is subjected to a specific heat treating schedule. A magnetic detector coil adjacent the other end of the crossbar detects the angular oscillation of the rod. Circuitry connected to the coils maintains the amplitude of oscillation of the rod constant. When the tip is immersed in a fluid, the power supplied to the drive coil is determined by the circuit and is a measure of the viscosity-density product of the fluid. The circuitry includes a sample-and-hold circuit having a clipping level which varies with the detector coil signal level, and a variable exponent amplifier to accurately correct for deviation of the drive coil current-power relationship from a square function.",NAT METAL AND REFINING COMPANY,MATUSIK FRANK J;;NELSON DONALD W,NATIONAL METAL AND REFINING COMPANY INC.

May 14, 1963 [Feb. 26, 1962], No. 7439/62. Heading H1M. In a variable capacitor the stator unit includes a ceramic dielectric element to which there is applied or secured a conductive area forming a stator plate, and a switch is provided which is actuated, e.g. to switch in a further capacitance, when the rotor is at a predetermined position with respect to the stator. In Fig. 1 the stator includes a dielectric element 3 comprising two arcuate metallic areas (shown dotted in the drawing) sandwiched between two ceramic discs. The rotor comprises an insulating member 6 carrying on one face (not shown) a sector-shaped stainless steel plate or metallized surface. The member 6 has two slots 10 engaged by lugs 11 provided on a plate 12 fixedly secured to the end of the spindle 8. The lugs 11 make electrical contact with the rotor electrode, and the angular position of the rotor relative to the spindle can be adjusted by moving the lugs in the slots 10, the slots 10 then being filled with wax or other filling. The plate 12 is adapted, e.g. in the maximum capacitance position, to engage switch contacts 13, the spatulate end 13B on one contact being contacted by the end 13C of the other; the contacts may bring in a further capacitance to change the tuning range of the capacitor. The dielectric element 3 may be formed from a sandwich consisting of a first ceramic layer 0.03 inch thick, the electrode forming material (preferably a metallized layer), and a further ceramic layer 0À01 inch thick, both ceramic layers being in the unfired or green state. After the sandwich has been fired the second ceramic layer, which forms the dielectric of the capacitor, is ground down to a thickness of 0À002 inch. A third screening arcuate strip may be provided between the two electrode arcuate strips and may be electrically connected to the spindle via a commutator-like sliding contact (drawing accompanying the Complete Specification, not shown). The dielectric element 3 may be secured to raised segments 23, of which only a few are shown, on a resilient mounting 4 which is backed by a backing disc 5 which may be, but preferably is not, secured to the mounting 4. The stator unit, comprising units 3, 4 and 5, is urged towards the rotor by a spring 25. The mounting 4 is provided with lugs 24 to locate the assembly in a housing 13A, and the spindle 8 may be provided with a lug 8D engaging a track 13D in the housing to limit the rotor movement, e.g. to 180 degrees or 190 degrees.",PLESSEY CO LTD,HOPTROFF VICTOR GEORGE;;TAYLOR DONALD FRANK,,https://lens.org/020-040-019-196-667,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H01G5/00;;H01G5/01,,H1M MAC           MAC,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The invention permits the use of these reserves at significantly lower cost than by producing pipeline natural gas to fuel gas turbines to generate electric power. These reserves currently generally are used only after the removal of impurities to produce pipeline natural gas quality turbine fuel. The latter current technology is capital intensive, and at current natural gas prices, economically unattractive.

For example, a pretreatment with chromic acid induces a negative space charge region, whereas a pretreatment with nitric acid induces a positive charge. The interface is then formed by vapor deposition of a silicon dioxide layer on the silicon surface. The pretreatment has been found capable of inducing a predetermined charge when the interface is provided by vapor deposition, but is wholly ineffective when the interface is provided by thermal oxidation. It is well known that thermal oxidation of a silicon surface inherently produces an interface having a positive space charge region.",FRANK J BARONE;;DONALD L TOLLIVER,BARONE FRANK J;;TOLLIVER DONALD L,,https://lens.org/039-320-691-237-910,Granted Patent,no,1,6,1,1,0,H01L21/00;;H01L21/02129;;H01L21/02164;;H01L21/02211;;H01L21/02271;;H01L21/02304;;H01L29/00;;H01L21/31612;;H01L21/00;;H01L21/02304;;H01L21/02271;;H01L21/02164;;H01L29/00;;H01L21/02211;;H01L21/02129,H01L21/00;;H01L21/316;;H01L29/00,H1K KCAL          CAL,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

CHRISTENSEN DIAMOND PRODUCTS CO. Jan. 21, 1965, No. 2637/65. Heading B3D. [Also in Division E1] A rotary cutter comprises a generally cylindrical body adapted to be rotated about its axis and having axially spaced circumferential ridges extending around its periphery and disposed normal to the body axis and diamond cutting elements spaced circumferentially from each other and embedded in said ridges. A cutter 13 comprises a generally cylindrical matrix body 18, cast on a hub 14, e.g. of steel, the hub and body having interlocking ribs 19, 20. The hub is secured on a shaft 12 by a key 16. The body 18 has ridges 23 and troughs 24 normal to the axis of rotation and in which circumferentially spaced diamond cutting elements 26, 27 are embedded. The elements 27 are preferably staggered relative to the elements 26. The path swept by an element 26 may be spaced from, closely adjacent to, or overlap the path swept by an adjacent element 27. The cutter 13 has end faces normal to the axis of rotation. One end of the cutter may terminate in a ridge and the other end terminate in a trough, the diamond cutting elements in the end ridge and end trough being substantially flush with the end faces. A cutter assembly may be formed by securing a number of cutters on the shaft 12 with spacers 22 located in counterbores 21 in the hubs 14. Alternate cutters may have both ends terminating in a ridge, the intervening cutters having both ends terminating in a trough. The cutter assembly, e.g. 1-5 feet wide, may be mounted in a wheeled carriage movable over a concrete or other road, airstrip or the like, so as to flatten high spots and cut grooves in the surface either in the direction of travel of a vehicle or aircraft or transversely thereto. The cutter assembly is preferably rotated at 1000 R.P.M., and flushing liquid, e.g. water, is pumped against the surface and the adjacent periphery of the cutter assembly. The cutter assembly may be vertically adjustable relative to the surface.",CHRISTENSEN DIAMOND PROD CO,CHRISTENSEN FRANK LANGTON;;MABEY DONALD HARRY,,https://lens.org/163-234-305-519-149,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,E01C23/088,E01C23/088,B3D D2G3A         -;;B3D D2G3E         -;;E1G G45A          G45A;;E1G G57X2         G57X,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
