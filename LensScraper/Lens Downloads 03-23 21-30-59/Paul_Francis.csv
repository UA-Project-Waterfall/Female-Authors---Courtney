What is thereby achieved is that the dirtiest part of the filter or reactor media is in continuous contact with the dirtiest part of the liquid or gas to be filtered, and at the point of the liquid or gas emerging from the solid bed, the solid bed is at its cleanest. A small but varying proportion of the filter bed is continuously or intermittently extracted at such a rate as is necessary to remove the deposited dirt and/or to avoid the blockage of the filter by the removed impurities. Such filtering media removed is then cleaned, suitably purified and, if necessary, chemically treated, before being returned to the filter bed with the new material. The filter bed itself is automatically filled at the same rate as discharged, on the lower end, and can consist of one or various mixtures of filtering media, if necessary with chemicals, flocculents and so on added to suit the purpose of the filtration and the nature of the impurities and of the liquid from which they have to be removed. such apparatus removes the necessity of backwashing the media inside the apparatus and obviates the costly backwash cycle controls.

Sliding-clasp fasteners. LIGHTNING FASTENERS, Ltd. Nov. 6, 1953 [Oct. 24, 1952], No. 26721/52. Class 44. In a machine for producing stringers for sliding clasp fasteners including an intermittently-actuated clamping means for securing fastener members to the stringer tape and an intermittently-rotated tape-feed wheel which is rotated through a substantially constant angle during each period of intermittent rotation for at least the greater part of each complete cycle of intermittent rotations and the clamping means being actuated between the periods of intermittent rotation to secure a fastener member to the tape, the periphery of the tape feed wheel whilst being continuous has a part thereof which is modified by the provision of either a projection or a depression so that the tape when in contact with the modified part is fed, during each period of intermittent rotation through the substantially constant angle, by a greater or lesser distance than that through which it is fed during another such period when in contact with the non-modified part of the wheel. As applied to a known type of machine in which a die table is provided with twelve equidistantly-spaced dies 3 for carrying a fastener member from a shearing and indenting position to a position for clamping on a tape 5 and in which V-section wire 7 is intermittently fed through a shearing block 9 and a fastener blank is sheared off by a reciprocating knife 11, and is carried to one of the dies 3 for indentation by a punch 13 and the knife then recedes and the table moves to present the next die to the knife and also in which the tape is fed intermittently upwardly by a wheel 15 and is inserted in a fastener member while the table is stationary, the fastener member being clamped to the tape which is then withdrawn from the table before the latter commences to rotate, the wheel 16 is replaced by a wheel 19, Fig. 2, having a projection 21 on the periphery thereof which effects a variation in the spacing of the fastener members during contact of the tape with the projection. In another arrangement, Fig. 3, (not shown) the wheel 15 is replaced by one having a depression on its periphery.

LIGHTNING FASTENERS, Ltd. Dec. 16, 1955 [Dec. 22, 1954], No. 37012/54. Class 83 (2). A process for making components of sliding clasp fasteners comprises feeding a metal strip to a punch which forms locating holes serving partly to define the outline of each component, registering the strip with respect to shearing means by use of the locating-holes and then shearing the strip between certain of the locating holes to produce two separable intermediate members each comprising a series of spaced partly-formed components bridged by a connecting-strip from which the components are subsequently severed. The formation of interlocking members is shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Holes 2 are first punched in the strip which is then sheared along lines 4 to form two intermediate members one of which, 5, is shown. Each interlocking member is completed by indenting at 6 and shearing along the line 8. Anodizing or other electrolytic treatment may be applied prior or subsequent to the indenting. Figs. 4 and 5 show the making of slider pulls, a strip being punched first with locating holes 11 and then with further holes 12 and 13 before being cut along the line 14 to form an intermediate strip 15 from which the pulls are severed along lines 16. Slider body plates are made by punching holes 21, Fig. 7, depressing the areas 22 within the dotted line 23, forming narrow slits 24, raising the portion therebetween and then shearing along lines 25 to form the strip shown in Fig. 8. The plates are completed by bending down the sides along the lines 26 and shearing along the lines 23. Half elements of open-box end stops are formed by punching holes 31, Fig. 10, shearing along lines 32 to form the intermediate strip, Fig. 11, which is bent along lines 36 and sheared at 37. Where anodizing or other surface treatment is applied, it is carried out before the individual components are severed from the intermediate strip and the components are of such shape that the surfaces newly exposed by such severing are those which become substantially concealed from view after assembly of the components in a slide fastener.",LIGHTNING FASTENERS LTD,SUTTON FRANCIS PAUL,,https://lens.org/158-232-459-442-033,Granted Patent,no,0,1,2,2,0,B21D53/52,B21D53/52,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

[Class 78 (i)] A shaker conveyer trough is supported by means of rollers or like rolling elements on a frame which is freely mounted for longitudinal oscillation upon a fixed support, the trough supporting means providing a position of rest for the trough with respect to the frame and providing also a restoring force which urges the trough at any moment towards the position of rest and which increases rapidly as the trough moves in the conveying direction, and relatively slowly as the trough moves rearwards Fig. 1. The conveying trough 18 is mounted on grooved wheels 22 which run on shoes 11 adjustably secured to a frame 1. Frame 1 is provided with grooved wheels 8 running on short rails 9 on fixed supports 10, and is reciprocated with a simple harmonic motion, e.g. by a long connecting rod 6 and a crank-shaft 4 rotating in fixed bearings. The resultant motion of trough 18 is dependent on the shape of the shoes 11 and on springs 24 which extend between trough 18 and frame 1. The arrangement is such that trough 18 is in its rest position with respect to frame 1 when nearly at the bottom of the straight rear portion of shoes 11 and springs 24 are forwardly inclined as shown. The front portion of shoes 11 is abruptly curved so that, when oscillating, as trough 18 moves from rear to forward limits of its motion with respect to frame 1, springs 24 first contract and then expand to a greater length than initially. Material is thereby conveyed forwardly along the trough. Fig 5. Shoes 11 are provided at their rear ends with a pair of spaced plates 13, secured thereto by welding. A bolt 14 is passed through the ends of the plates, forming a slot through which a threaded link 15 is passed the lower end of the link being pivoted to frame 1. To the front end of shoes 11 a bracket 12 is fixed, which bracket is pivoted to frame 1. Adjusting nuts 16, 17 permit shoes 11 to be tilted as required.",SOMOGYI FRANCIS PAUL,SOMOGYI FRANCIS PAUL,,https://lens.org/080-842-231-075-521,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,B65G27/00;;B65G2812/0352,B65G27/00,F2S SSF           SSF;;F2S S1241         SSF,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

BP CHEMICALS (U.K.) Ltd. 25 Jan., 1968 [31 Jan., 1967], No. 4618/67. Heading C3P. Aqueous copolymer dispersions are prepared by copolymerizing a vinyl ester of a saturated monocarboxylic acid and isobutene in aqueous dispersion in the presence of a free radical catalyst and a surface-active agent and/or protective colloid until 65 to 95 weight per cent of the total monomer charge is polymerized, removing unpolymerized isobutene from the dispersion and continuing the polymerization of the residual vinyl ester. The vinyl ester may be of acetic, propionic, butyric, tertiary aliphatic or benzoic acids. Other comonomers, e.g. acrylic, methacrylic, fumaric and itaconic acids and esters, vinyl halides, and minor proportions of multiunsaturated compounds, e.g. ethylene glycol diacrylate, butylene glycol dimethacrylate, vinyl acrylate, triallyl cyanurate and divinyl adipate, may also be present, The process may be effected batchwise or continuously, and the monomers and catalyst may be added proportionally or incrementally. Preferably further catalyst is added after the removal of the isobutene. Examples describe polymerizations using vinyl acetate, isobutene and emulsifiers together with (1) ammonium persulphate and potassium bicarbonate; (2) ammonium persulphate, benzoyl peroxide, sodium metabisulphite and potassium bicarbonate; (3) butylene glycol dimethacrylate, ammonium persulphate and potassium bicarbonate; (4) 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, potassium persulphate, disodium salt of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, sodium bicarbonate and gum arabic; (5) vinyl chloride, ammonium persulphate, sodium bicarbonate and polyvinyl alcohol; and (6) vinyl propionate, potassium persulphate, sodium carbonate and hydroxyethyl cellulose.",BP CHEM INT LTD,GINTZ FRANCIS PAUL,,https://lens.org/065-239-135-667-359,Granted Patent,no,0,0,10,10,0,C08F218/04;;C08F10/00,C08F10/00;;C08F218/04,C3P PKF           PKF;;C3P PKT           PKT;;C3P P10D1A        -;;C3P P10D8         -;;C3P P10K4         -;;C3P P10K7         -;;C3P P10P1E5       -;;C3P P10P2A1       -;;C3P P10P2A4       -;;C3P P10P2C        -;;C3P P10P6A        -;;C3P P10P6B        -;;C3P P4D2          -;;C3P P4D3A         -;;C3P P4D3B1        -;;C3P P4D3B2        -;;C3P P4D3B3        -;;C3P P4D8          -;;C3P P4K10         -;;C3P P4K7          -;;C3P P4K8          -;;C3P P4P1C         -;;C3P P4P1E1        -;;C3P P4P1E5        -;;C3P P4P1F         -;;C3P P4P2A1        -;;C3P P4P2A4        -;;C3P P4P2C         -;;C3P P4P6A         -;;C3P P4P6B         -;;C3P P640          PKT;;C3P P642          PKT;;C3P P7D1B         -;;C3P P7D8          -;;C3P P7K10         -;;C3P P7K4          -;;C3P P7K8          -;;C3P P7P1C         -;;C3P P7P1E1        -;;C3P P7P1E5        -;;C3P P7P1F         -;;C3P P7P2A1        -;;C3P P7P2A4        -;;C3P P7P2C         -;;C3P P7P6A         -;;C3P P7P6B         -;;C3P P8D2A         -;;C3P P8D2B2        -;;C3P P8D5          -;;C3P P8D8          -;;C3P P8K4          -;;C3P P8K7          -;;C3P P8P1E5        -;;C3P P8P2A1        -;;C3P P8P2A4        -;;C3P P8P2C         -;;C3P P8P6A         -;;C3P P8P6B         -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Both the pre-reduction of the catalyst and the hydrogenation of the phosphatide may be performed at 5 to 100 p.s.i.g. being preferably 45 p.s.i.g. and 15 p.s.i.a. respectively, and it is desirable to prevent contact of the catalyst with an oxidizing agent, e.g. air, between the two stages. The phosphatide may be pretreated with an acid, acid anhydride or a solvent comprising an alcohol to inhibit catalyst inactivation and, in general any solvent, or combination of solvents, in which the phosphatide is soluble but which will not inactivate the catalyst may be used for the reaction. It is desirable that such solvents should be removable under vacuum at temperatures lower than 95 DEG C. The phosphatide may also be bleached with an oxidizing agent, e.g. hydrogen peroxide, before or after hydrogenation in order to lighten the colour of the product. It is preferable to conduct the hydrogenation at below 70 DEG C. preferably 25 to 60 DEG C., and to filter off the catalyst at the end of the reaction after the addition of a filter acid. During this filtration the catalyst should be protected from oxygen and, in this connection, it is desirable to saturate the product solution with hydrogen or an inert gas, e.g. nitrogen, prior to filtration. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the product may be vacuum steam deodorized. Solutions of base, or aqueous suspensions of bases of limited water solubility, may be added to the product before or after deodorization to raise the aqueous pH to as high as 8.0, after which the water may be removed under vacuum. Numerous examples are given employing as the source of phosphatide commercial soybean lecithin, oil-free soybean phosphatides, alcohol-soluble or insoluble fractions of soybean phosphatides, peanut lecithin and com lecithin.

   A pressure based mass flow controller that can be used, for example, in semiconductor manufacturing for precisely delivering a process vapor to a process chamber. The controller can be used with a low vapor pressure source, and has a simplified, novel design, that allows the controller to be easily and inexpensively incorporated in a system including a plurality of such controllers and a plurality of vapor sources. The controller includes a flow path for connection to a vapor source, a flow restrictor dividing the flow path into an upstream reservoir and a downstream reservoir, an upstream pressure measurement device connected to the upstream reservoir, and a flow valve connected to the flow path. The controller also includes a control device programmed to receive a desired flow rate, an indication of upstream pressure from the upstream pressure measurement device, an indication of downstream pressure from a remote downstream pressure measurement device connected to the downstream reservoir. The control device then determines an actual mass flow rate during choked flow conditions in accordance with a linear function of the upstream pressure, and during non-choked flow conditions in accordance with a nonlinear function of the upstream pressure and the downstream pressure. The control device is also programmed to instruct the flow valve to increase flow if the actual flow rate is less than the desired flow rate, and to decrease flow if the actual flow rate is greater than the desired flow rate.

Class 89(3) The movement of the anvil into position adjacent the clenching punch in a power operated stapling maching closes a switch to actuate an electrically-operated single revolution clutch and drive the mechanism for stapling articles on the anvil, e.g. slide fasteners on trousers. A camshaft 1 carries operating cams 4, 5, a spur gear 9, a freely-mounted wheel 6 driven by an electric motor and a single revolution clutch 35 keyed to the shaft 1. The spur gear drives circular feed cams 14 through gearing 10, 12, 13, so that pronged staple elements in sheet form are fed forward one at a time along strip guides 17. Cam 4 operates a resilient punch 22 to bend the prongs of the staple through a right angle (Fig. 5, not shown). Cam 5 operates a roller 28 and starplate 29 driving shearing and clenching punch 26 in the lower part of which is the shearing knife 31 and spring lips 32. The anvil 36 is mounted on the support arm 37, pivoted at 39 and carrying a finger 44 adapted when the anvil has been moved to the stapling position to actuate a microswitch 46 and the solenoid which brings the clutch 36 into operation for a single cycle of stapling movements, i.e. feeding, bending, shearing and clenching of the staple. The support arm in its inoperative position presses the spring jaw 54 which normally holds the slider of a slide fastener adapted to be stapled to a garment, allowing the slider to be inserted or removed. In a machine for continuous feed and stapling operation (Fig. 11a, not shown), a locating pin on the anvil projects between the tapes carrying the interlocked slide fastener, and the end of each fastener portion moves the pin and anvil so as to actuate the switch and operate the stapler, the clenching action disengaging the locating pin for further control.",LIGHTNING FASTENERS LTD,SUTTON FRANCIS PAUL,,https://lens.org/175-739-119-895-270,Granted Patent,no,0,3,2,2,0,A44B19/60,A44B19/60,B4C CC3           CC3,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A security device for a bottle having a neck fitted with a closure comprises a sleeve ( 10 ) adapted to fit over the neck of the bottle and a catch member ( 26 ) pivoted to the sleeve ( 10 ) for movement between free and locking positions. The catch member has an inner portion ( 13 ) which projects through an aperture ( 12 ) in the sleeve, into the bore thereof, which inner portion ( 13 ) is adapted to engage a shoulder of the bottle neck or an edge of the closure, thereby to resist removal of the sleeve ( 10 ) from a bottle neck when the device has been fitted thereto. A magnetic armature ( 38 ) is connected to the catch member ( 26 ) such that an applied magnetic field will move the armature ( 38 ) so as then to move the catch member to its free position and thereafter permit removal of the sleeve from the bottle. A housing ( 11 ) encloses the release mechanism and also a radio-frequency or other security responder whereby unauthorised removal of a bottle carrying the security device from a protected area will sound an alarm.

The first and second parts (44, 50) are adapted and arranged to communicate remotely when the filter (48) is correctly located in the pre-determined position. The interlock (44, 50) is adapted and arranged selectively to allow or prevent operation of the airflow generator (52) depending upon the relative separation between the first and second parts (44, 50).

    An integrated radio telecommunications network which integrates an ANSI-  41  circuit switched network and a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) packet data network to support a mobile station which operates in both the ANSI-  41  network and the GPRS network. An interworking function interfaces a mobile switching center (MSC) in the ANSI-  41  network with a serving GPRS switching node (SGSN) in the GPRS network by mapping circuit switched signaling utilized by the MSC into GPRS packet switched signaling utilized by the SGSN, and mapping GPRS packet switched signaling into circuit switched signaling. An interworking GPRS base station controller interfaces the SGSN with a GPRS/ANSI-  136  base station which supports both ANSI-  136  operations and GPRS operations. The interworking GPRS base station controller adapts the traffic signaling format utilized by the SGSN into an air interface traffic signaling format utilized by the GPRS/ANSI-  136  base station. An authentication center interface passes the authentication state of the mobile station between an ANSI-41 home location register/authentication center (HLR/AC) in the ANSI-  41  network, and a GPRS home location register/authentication center (HLR/AUC) in the GPRS network.
