The object of present invention is to provide contextualized information services that must be used in the IoT context-aware systems to provide information services.In the propose context base routing protocol i.e. CBRP node in the network are divide into cluster area on the basis of the filed dimension, numbers of node in the field and the number of rounds. In the cluster area decide the one cluster head on the basis of the energy and threshold value or node which is nearer to the base station and every time the cluster head is change.Following invention is described in detail with the help of Figure 1 of sheet 1 showing. ss Fgr1 Figure 1 Figure 2",ARORA VINAY DR;;BAJPAI BHAVNA DR;;BARTERE MAHIP M DR;;DESHMUKH H R DR;;DHIMAN GAURAV DR;;GARG MEENAKSHI DR;;LOKULWAR PRASAD DR;;PASUPATHI SUBBULAKSHMI DR;;SONI MUKESH MR;;VERMA BASANT KUMAR DR;;VIMAL S DR,LOKULWAR PRASAD;;VERMA BASANT KUMAR;;DHIMAN GAURAV;;VIMAL S;;PASUPATHI SUBBULAKSHMI;;ARORA VINAY;;SONI MUKESH;;GARG MEENAKSHI;;BAJPAI BHAVNA;;DESHMUKH H R;;BARTERE MAHIP M,,https://lens.org/134-269-433-843-478,Limited Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H04L45/00;;H04W84/18;;H04W4/70,H04L12/701;;H04W4/70;;H04W84/18,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE
