Regulating. GARDNER & SONS Ltd., L. April 27, 1961 [May 12, 1960], No 16761/60. Class 7(6) In a marine internal combustion engine a single hand level a Fig. 1 controls the engine speed and the Ahead, Neutral and Astern positions of the engine drive reverse gear through three plug valves keyed to the spindle b which control a hydraulic cylinder/piston arrangement Fig. 6 to operate the reverse gear, through a rod i; movement of the lever a through a small angle from the neutral position merely operating the reverse gear after which the engine speed control z can be operated from idling to full speed whilst the reverse gear remains in the selected position. For the Astern position of the reverse gear the level a closes plug valves d and e Fig. 6 and causes plug value c to admit pressure oil to the right hand side of the piston h and relieves the pressure at the other side to move the rod i appropriately. During this first small angular movement of the handle a the part t moves along a slot w and when the Astern position is reached abuts the end of the slow w. Further movement of the handle a is translated by a rod y into control of the engine speed or governor lever z. Control of the reverse gear and engine speed for the Ahead position is effected in a similar manner by opposite movement of handle a. Frictional retention of the position of handle a is provided by a pad 10, Fig. 3. The engine lubrication oil may be used as the pressure fluid and by-pass cocks may be fitted in two pipes connected to opposite ends of the cylinder g to make the hydraulic system inoperative without affecting the engine speed control. The hand lever may be remotely controlled from a ship wheelhouse.",GARDNER & SONS LTD,GARDNER JOHN KYNASTON;;GARDNER JOHN PAUL,,https://lens.org/153-655-977-777-768,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B63H21/213;;F01L13/00;;F01L2760/002,B63H21/22;;F01L13/00,F1B BBC           BC80;;F1B BB150         BC80;;F1B BB180         BC80;;F1B BB219         BC80;;F1B BB222         BC80;;F2D DA108         DA-M;;F2D DCG           DA-M;;F2D DC032         DA-M;;F2D DC085         DA-M;;F2D DC087         DA-M;;F2D DC097         DA-M,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Use of a functional language enables any valid application to be denoted by an evaluation tree, whose leaves denote literals or unbound variables. Static analysis of such an application can produce a maximal evaluation tree denoting the potential evaluation of all application branches. Firstly, it is necessary to define a naming scheme whereby all unbound variables are given an unambiguous name, particularly in recursive constructs. Secondly it is necessary to analyse the application to extract maps of the information it may use, in particular to produce information maps for individual usages of unbound variables. The latter is dependent on the naming scheme. This can be achieved automatically. The resulting maps are then merged to produce one map per variable, which comprises a single ""inverted"" tree.

A vehicle heating system comprises three parallel circuits for engine coolant, namely a radiator circuit RC, a radiator by-pass circuit BC and a heating circuit HC, and temperatureresponsive valve means 7 common to all three circuits. At low temperatures valves 8 and 9 close outlets 12, 13 to circuits RC and HC and coolant flows through outlet 11 to circuit BC. As the coolant temperature rises valve 9 gradually closes outlet 11 while opening outlet 13 so that eventually all the coolant flows to circuit HC. If the temperature continues to rise valve 8 gradually opens outlet 12 while closing a port 15 communicating with valve 9 so that eventually all the coolant flows through circuit RC.

   A new way to webify host applications and streamline them for different user groups, without revising the original application on the host, enhances the usability of host applications in a web environmentproviding a graphical user interface and streamlining the flow of information for current or new user groups. Host application materials are analyzed as source material, rather than as a literal script. Processing can alter the way host information is presentedboth in terms of appearance and sequencemaking it possible to present just the information user groups care about, with a new graphical interface that's familiar to today's PC users. Additional components using JavaScript control how information from the host is presented in a web browser, without modifying the original application on the host system. Customization is based on how host systems work, and is used to adapt host applications to the web and to design effective graphical interfaces that make host applications easy to use. This unique blend allows a webified application to be available quickly, and to give the precisely desired results to its users.

    A hydroelectric power plant uses a plurality of windmills connected to compressed air generators to produce pressurized air. Pressurized air is used to drive water through a turbine to produce electrical power. The water is recycled and the power plant includes reserve pressurized air tanks to allow the plant to continue to operate when the wind levels are not sufficient to produce high pressure air. The power plant is designed to be operated on a continuous basis based on wind power. When the wind subsides and the reserve capacity has been exhausted, electricity can be drawn from the local utility supplier. When excess power is generated by the power plant, electricity from the power plant can be added to the grid of the local electricity supplier.

The plunge mechanism is movable between a retracted position and an extended position. A reference mark is provided on the plunge mechanism so that the reference mark moves with the plunge mechanism. A detector is also mounted to the cartridge engaging assembly. As the plunge mechanism is extended, the detector detects the reference mark and produces an output signal which is related thereto. A control system is operatively associated with the detector and is responsive to the output signal produced thereby. The control system is also operatively associated with the plunge mechanism. As a result, the control system can regulate the position of the plunge mechanism based on the output signal produced by the detector.

   The present invention provides fibrous pest deterrents that combine the useful properties of a physical barrier in the form of a non-woven fibrous matrix with a chemical deterrent such as a pesticide, behavior-modifying compound or a pest repellent. The use of such fibrous pest deterrents protects plants, animals and structures in both agricultural and non-agricultural settings from damage inflicted by pests. Unlike traditional pesticides, the behavior-modifying compound, pesticide or chemical deterrent of the present invention is adsorbed or attached to a fibrous matrix, and so it is not so readily dispersed into the environment. Hence, use of the present fibrous pest deterrents can reduce the levels of pesticides that inadvertently contaminate non-target areas and pollute water supplies. The present fibrous pest deterrents therefore help moderate in the use of pesticides in commercial agricultural and non-agricultural operations, home gardens, and the urban environment, alleviating public concerns about pesticide run-off, contamination of the environment and risks to human health.

The reference line is also center lengthwise to be tangentially center with respect to a tangential point on the track. The detector is adjustable both radially and tangentially. The tangential adjustment is based upon sensing two low reflective calibration marks on the disk that indicate centering the laser beam, hence the track tangent point, on the reference line. The calibration is based upon obtaining minimum noise in the detector output signal that signifies that the laser beam is centered on the length of the detector reference line. The calibration marks are in a mirror area disposed at one radial extremity of the disk. The marks are radially elongate and disposed in a radially outward diverge with respect to each other.

   A reflectometry apparatus and method is presented that allow the diffuse and specular reflectance parameters of an object to be independently and reliably measured, and that allow the variations in surface normal and surface height to be estimated. An extended light source having an elongated configuration, for example a linear cylindrical light source such as a neon tube, is moved across the surface of an object while a digital camera detects the reflected light to acquire a series of images of the object surface. A reflectance trace table is synthesized for a range of model parameters using a virtualized rendition of the linear light source. For each pixel, the observed reflectances are compared to the synthesized reflectance trace table, to determine the reflectance parameters that most closely match the observed data.

[Also in Division C3] An elastic curable filament of from 0À5 to 1000 denier comprises an olefin polymer containing a major proportion, preferably 60 to 85 wt. per cent ethylene and at least one other C 3 to C 10 α-olefin, preferably propylene, and may contain 0À1 to 20% of a C 5 to C 40 diolefin preferably 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene, said polymer having a crystallinity at rest of from 1 to 20% and a pre-cure tensile strength of from 200 to 525 p.s.i. at normal temperatures and methods of processing the filaments after preferably meltspinning, or wet-spinning. After melt-spinning the filament surface is allowed to set, the filament is stretched 1À5 to 10 times its length and subsequently cross-linked under tension. After wet-spinning the surface of the spun filament is allowed to set in a liquid setting medium, the filament is stretched from 1À5 to 10 times its length, the filament is thereafter allowed to dry under tension and finally cross-linked under tension. The cross-linking may be effected free radically by peroxides or radiation for polymers not containing a diolefin or for polymers containing a diolefin cross-linking may be effected by fluid curing means which comprises subjecting the filaments to the vapour at an elevated temperature or a solution in an inert solvent of a low M.W. sulphur/chlorine compound; preferably sulphur dichloride. The liquid setting medium for wet spinning is a low M.W. oxygen containing solvent such as a ketone or alcohol and is preferably methanol, ethanol or mixtures thereof.

Controlling the olefin concentration in desorbing and/or purging mediums. BRITISH PETROLEUM CO. Ltd. Oct. 20, 1966 [Nov. 4, 1965], No. 46754/65. Heading B1L. In a cyclic process employing molecular sieves to separate straight chain hydrocarbons from branched chain and/or cyclic hydrocarbons, in which process the circulation of desorbing and/or purging medium is effected, and in which process olefins tend to build up in the circulating medium to an equilibrium level, the olefin concentration is controlled by hydrogenating at least a proportion of the olefins. Preferably the purging medium is hydrogen, the desorbing medium is n-pentane, and the hydrogenation is carried out in the presence of a catalyst comprising either nickel supported upon sepiolite or cobalt and molybdenum oxides supported on alumina. The denormalised hydrogen fraction containing n-pentane and hydrogen together with olefins obtained from the purge stage passes from absorbers through line 1 to hydrogen separator 2 and thence to stripper 4 from where the final de-normalised product is removed as bottoms and the npentane and olefins as overhead offtake. The n-pentane and olefins are similarly stripped at 12 from the normal paraffins from the desorption stage. The n-pentane fed to drum 10 from strippers 4 and 12 is recirculated to the absorber, a portion being hydrogenated in reactor 17 and fed into the stripper 2 for removal of any hydrogen present in the hydrogenated n-pentane stream.",BRITISH PETROLEUM CO,TURNBULL JOHN NEIL;;LAWRENCE PAUL ANTHONY;;GARDNER JOHN FRANCIS,,https://lens.org/013-742-152-088-342,Granted Patent,no,0,0,11,12,0,C10G25/03;;C10G25/03,C10G25/03,B1L L5B2          -;;C5E E7AY          E8/9;;C5E E7A2          E8/9;;C5E E8A5A6        E8/9;;C5E E8A5Y         E8/9;;C5E E9B8D         E8/9;;C5E E9B8Y         E8/9,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Alignment may be performed by beam steering of the outputs of a three-channel detector, which may detect both signal and noise.

The tangential adjustment is based upon sensing two low reflective calibration marks on the disk that indicate centering the laser beam, hence the track tangent point, on the reference line. The calibration is based upon obtaining minimum noise in the detector output signal that signifies that the laser beam is centered on the length of the detector reference line. The calibration marks are in a mirror area disposed at one radial extremity of the disk. The marks are radially elongate and disposed in a radially outward diverge with respect to each other.

A first local vocoder receives the packetized vocoder data from the wireless link. The first local vocoder converts the packetized data to a multibit PCM output. The first local vocoder also adds a detection code to one of the least significant bits (LSB) of the PCM output. The first local vocoder passes the PCM signal to the PSTN from the second end user. The first local vocoder also receives PCM input over the PSTN. The first local vocoder constantly monitors the least significant bit of the PCM input for a detection code indicating that a second local vocoder is connected at the receiving end. If the first local vocoder detects the detection code from the second local vocoder, it begins to substitute packetized data and a redundancy check for a second one of the LSB's of the outgoing PCM. The first local vocoder also begins to monitor the second one of the LSB's of the incoming PCM. If the redundancy check indicates that valid packetized data has been received, the first local vocoder stops converting the PCM output into packetized data and simply passes the packetized data on the second one of the LSB's to the first remote vocoder. If at any time the redundancy check fails and the detection code is not detected, the first local vocoder returns to converting the incoming PCM to packetized data. In this way, the tandem vocoding arrangement is avoided.","WEAVER, JR.; LINDSAY A.;;LAM; S.

The unified index allows query retrieval by evaluation of a query structure which can contain any of the multimedia data types, and operators which can be evaluated on any of these data types. The system indexes multimedia documents by separating them into their multimedia components, and processing each component into a number of tokens. The tokens are stored in the index along with information identifying the documents that contain the token, and reference data describing the position of the token within the documents, and any other data extracted from the multimedia component of the document, such as color, texture, luminance, recognized speech, or the like. During retrieval, a query is decomposed into multimedia components, which are then converted to a set of tokens and query structure including mathematical and proximity operators. Query expansion is used to expand the query structure to include additional tokens corresponding to various ones of input query tokens.

   A disposable core structure supports a porous polymeric brush utilized in the treatment of substrates. The disposable core structure includes an exterior surface featuring a plurality of waffle-like recesses separated by walls having sufficient thinness to permit fabrication by injection molding. The core structure includes an end adapted to permit attachment to a rotating member of an associated substrate handling apparatus. The end of the core structure further includes an opening to a bore in fluid communication with pores on the exterior surface of the core structure. Injection molding allows economical mass production of the core structure, permitting it to be fitted with the polymeric brush in a clean room setting and then be permanently fixed to a single brush.
