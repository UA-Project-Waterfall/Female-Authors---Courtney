S., (Representative of ELECTRIC RACING MACHINES, Ltd.). Aug. 16, 1950 [May 17, 1949], No. 13165/49. Class 132 (ii). In a race game in which models of humanly controlled racing objects e.g. horses or cars each traverse a track comprising a continuous rail C<SP>2</SP> and a broken rail C<SP>1</SP>, switches S<SP>1</SP>-S<SP>6</SP> being provided to restore the supply of current to the model when it has been stopped by reaching the space between two sections c' of the rail C', the switches S<SP>1</SP>-S<SP>6</SP> are operated by a replica of the control means of the model located at a stationary position and actuated by a competing player. In the straight parts of the track alternate sections c' are connected to switches S' and S<SP>2</SP> and the intermediate sections to switches S<SP>3</SP> and S<SP>4</SP>. Switches S<SP>2</SP> and S' are associated with resistances r<SP>2</SP> and r' so that the models move slower when controlled by these switches. Switches S<SP>5</SP> and S<SP>6</SP> are included in the circuits of the portions c' on the curved parts of the track in addition to the switches S<SP>1</SP>-S<SP>4</SP>. A starting gate is provided in a starting branch of the track and when this is raised a switch S is made to set the apparatus. Each track has a resistance R of different value to compensate for the unequal lengths of concentric tracks. The switch S<SP>5</SP> also operates a set of points leading into a finishing branch. Model jumps are provided between the sections c'. In Fig. 4, the controlling replica B comprises the head and neck of a horse and part of the back which has a saddle B<SP>1</SP>, these two parts being joined by flexible material b' and having respectively a part N carrying the switches S<SP>1</SP>-S<SP>4</SP> and a part P carrying the switches S<SP>5</SP> and S' and being respectively horizontally pivoted at N<SP>1</SP> and vertically pivoted at P<SP>1</SP>. The head is normally maintained central by springs T. When a model has reached the end of a section c' i.e. has reached a jump, the head is manipulated by reins b so as to change over the switches S<SP>1</SP>-S<SP>4</SP> and cause the model to traverse another section. On the curved parts and at the point leading to the finish it is also necessary to move the head from side to side in order to operate one or other of the switches S<SP>5</SP> and S<SP>6</SP>. The model e.g. a horse is mounted on a rod E running in a slot h in the top k of a box-like track support K. The rod E slides in a tube F mounted on a carriage G running on the rails C<SP>1</SP>, C<SP>2</SP> and having a motor H supplied with current by brushes h, h'. The front wheel g<SP>2</SP> is pivoted. To give the model a galloping motion the rod E has a pin e passing through a slot f<SP>1</SP> in the tube F and fixed to a wheeled carriage L running on a rail M having undulations m to give the model an up and down motion. An additional tie E' is provided between the front of the carriage L and the front legs of the model. At the jumps, a higher part M' of the rail M is provided. If the wheels of the model are of metal one set of brushes can be dispensed with. The jockeys on the model horses may have internal lamps and may be readily unseated. When the device simulates car or motor-cycle racing, movement of the steering wheel or of the handle-bars on the replica will operate the control switches. According to the Provisional Specification two interrupted rails and one continuous rail may be provided, the former being connected to separate control switches and having their insulated parts staggered. Certain parts of the track may be traversed by gravity action. Several modified forms of the model and track are indicated. The models may be driven by compressed air or by moving belts or chains.",ERIC STEVENSON BROWNE,DAY ARTHUR STANLEY,,https://lens.org/114-062-792-617-145,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,A63F9/143,A63F9/14,A6H HLA           HLA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In addition, the apparatus and method of the present invention provide for initially drilling the hole with a countersink and for inserting a fastener into the hole, through the electromagnet, immediately after drilling the hole, such that the hole does not have to be revisited after reassembly and drying of the sealant in order to drill a countersink and/or insert a fastener.

The fixed blade 10 is mounted on a bracket 48 which is rotatably mounted on a lateral support 14 secured to the shaft 16 by a stub shaft 50 which is rotatable within a sleeve 52, spring-loaded balls selectively engaging apertures 56 in the bracket 48 to locate the blades in the desired position. One or more ground-contacting plastic rollers 58 are provided. Lateral play between the blades is prevented by the spring 20 surrounding the pivot-pin 22 and the blade 12 is laterally inclined to the blade 10 to promote selfsharpening of the blades. In a modification, the member 36 operates as a pulling member 1 and a small hand lever is provided for moving the blades into a different plane.",MITCHEL & KING LTD,STAPLES JOHN;;DAY ARTHUR CLIFFORD,,https://lens.org/027-621-248-046-531,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,A01D34/02;;A01D2101/00,A01D34/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The initiation electrode has an exposed tip positioned adjacent to a surface of the dielectric layer. The high-voltage switch is configured to selectively isolate the initiation electrode from ground potential. The optical sensor is positioned and configured to sense light generated at the surface due to a propagating brush discharge. The controller is programmed to operate the high-voltage switch to ground the initiation electrode and to operate the optical sensor to collect light from the propagating brush discharge. Propagating brush discharge testing methods include positioning an exposed tip of an initiation electrode with respect to a surface of a dielectric layer, then charging the surface, and then grounding the initiation electrode to neutralize charge on the surface (generally causing a propagating brush discharge).",BOEING CO,NIKIC DEJAN;;DAY ARTHUR C,THE BOEING COMPANY (2017-01-23),https://lens.org/011-453-385-949-269,Patent Application,yes,7,4,4,4,0,G01R31/1218;;G01R31/1218;;G01N27/60;;G01N27/61;;G01R15/165;;G01R15/165;;G01R29/24;;G01R29/24;;G01R31/16;;G01R31/16,G01R31/12;;G01R31/16,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

   The electromagnetic clamp and method includes an electromagnet and a clamping piece located on opposite sides of a structure to clamp the structure. The electromagnet attracts the clamping piece through the structure when the electromagnet is energized, such that the electromagnet and clamping piece exert force on the structure, and an operation, such as drilling and/or fastener installation, may be performed on the structure. The configuration of the electromagnet creates the force necessary to securely clamp the structure. The electromagnet includes a coil and a core, and the core of the electromagnet is located within a longitudinal aperture that extends through the coil. The smallest lateral dimension of the core is chosen to maximize the flux density between the core and the clamping piece. As such, the smallest lateral dimension of the electromagnet may be greater than the distance between the clamping piece and the electromagnet.

June 4, 1956 [June 24, 1955], No. 18288/55. Class 38 (4). In a system for automatically controlling a variable arc arm moving in response to changes in the magnitude of the variable moves a vane to interrupt light falling on a photo-transistor so that a contact-making relay in circuit with the photo-transistor is operated to control the variable. As shown, a galvanometer 11 responsive to change in the value of a variable, e.g. furnace temperature as detected by a thermocouple connected to terminals 3, 3, moves an arm 2 carrying a vane 4 so that, at a predetermined value of the variable, light from a tungsten lamp 5 passing through a lens system 9 and falling on a photo-transistor 6 is interrupted at the focal point 10. This reduces the energization of a winding C<SP>1</SP> of a relay 11 so that a contact S<SP>1</SP> is changed over from the position shown, in which it caused operation of means (not shown) to raise the value of the variable, e.g. by supplying more fuel, to a position in which it causes reduction of the value of the variable. The differential of relay 11 is reduced by auxiliary windings C<SP>2</SP> and C3 acting in appropriate senses which are introduced by a relay contact S<SP>2</SP>. The effect of these windings is delayed by the self heating of negative temperature coefficient resistors R<SP>1</SP> and R<SP>2</SP> respectively and is adjustable by a rheostat VR3.",ETHER LTD,SPRAGG ALBERT DAY;;WHEELER THOMAS ARTHUR;;MARTIN TREVOR LEWIS,,https://lens.org/097-599-742-762-032,Granted Patent,no,0,1,3,3,0,G05B11/017,G05B11/01,G1A AA3           MRP;;G1A AA7           MRP;;G1A AC1           MRP;;G1A AD4           MRP;;G1A AG1           MRP;;G1A AG4           MRP;;G1A AG6           MRP;;G1A AG9           MRP;;G1A AMR           MRP;;G1A AMRP          MRP4;;G1A AP17          MRP;;G1A AR7           MRP;;G1A AS3           MRP;;G1A AT15          MRP;;G1A AT25          MRP;;G1A AT3           MRP;;G1A AT8           MRP,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
