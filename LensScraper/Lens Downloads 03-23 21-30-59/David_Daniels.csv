The pinion wheel 39 meshes with the gear-wheel 23 coupled to shaft 3 and also to a wheel 40 spring coupled to wheel 23 so as to pinch the teeth of pinion 39 and provide light friction. During setting, wheel 23 is driven anti-clockwise, and friction enables the gear-wheel 23 to draw the plate 38 and the impulse cam 35 away from the normal position against stop 44 without rotation of the pinion-wheel 39. When lug 37 reaches stop 33, however, the pinion is driven and rotates the cam idly until the finger wheel is set to the finger stop. The angular position with which the cam comes to rest would be the position with which it returns to the contacts 4 and unless this is the position shown in Fig. 1, a distorted first pulse will be transmitted. To ensure the angular cam setting of Fig. 1, regardless of small errors in setting the finger plate to the stop, as many studs 45, 46, 47 as there are impulse lobes, are raised on the upper face of the cam and these studs co-operate with a spring arm 28 depending from a cantilever arm 31. As seen in Fig. 4 and from the track lines a, b and c, when the dial is set the stud 45 encounters the arm 28 and the cam is turned slightly as the stud passes by. When the dial is set and before release of the finger plate the cam adopts an angular position such as shown in Fig. 6. The studs are indicated as x, y and z, as the particular one in the path of arm 28 will depend on the digit dialled. The stud involved is taken to be x and in Fig. 11 this may occupy a position between the extremes x<SP>1</SP> and x<SP>11</SP> and during return motion of the dial will encounter the arm 28 and will turn the cam 35 into the correct position for delivery to the contacts 4. As it is possible for a stud to be driven against the arm 28 with the cam unable to rotate, the arm 28 is made flexible to provide a retreat from such misuse.

    A method of managing data in a hierarchical data storage system employing data redundancy schemes includes prioritizing a data rebuild based on a most vulnerable data redundancy scheme in the storage system. A data storage system embodying this rebuild prioritization method is also described. Prioritizing the data rebuild includes enabling a rebuild of the most vulnerable data redundancy scheme prior to enabling a rebuild of any other data redundancy scheme in the system. The most vulnerable data redundancy scheme is determined by comparing a probability of losing data that can be prevented by a rebuild for each data redundancy scheme with respect to the potential for one or more next storage device failures in the data storage system. The probability of losing data for each data redundancy scheme is determined by considering characteristics associated with the storage system and disk drives in the storage system, including number of storage devices, mean time between failure, mean time or calculated time to rebuild, and failure dependencies.

    Improved host I/O performance and availability of a storage array during rebuild is obtained by prioritizing I/O requests. In one embodiment, rebuild I/O requests are given priority over host I/O requests when the storage array is close to permanently losing data (for example, failure of one more particular disk in the storage array would result in data loss). Rebuild I/O requests continue to have priority over host I/O requests until the storage array is no longer close to permanently losing data, at which point host I/O requests are given priority over rebuild I/O requests.

   Improved host I/O performance and availability of a storage array during rebuild is obtained by prioritizing I/O requests. In one embodiment, rebuild I/O requests are given priority over host I/O requests when the storage array is close to permanently losing data (for example, failure of one more particular disk in the storage array would result in data loss). Rebuild I/O requests continue to have priority over host I/O requests until the storage array is no longer close to permanently losing data, at which point host I/O requests are given priority over rebuild I/O requests.

The interface comprises an input data circuit, operatively connected to a serial data input line and to an associated input clock line, for receiving serial data input words comprising 8 serial data bits and an end-of-message (EOM) bit. The input circuit converts the serial input words into parallel form and transfers them to a programmable interface controller. The interface also includes an output circuit for transforming parallel output words from the interface controller into serial format. The output circuit is operatively connected to a serial data output line and an output data clock line from the OCIA type port. When an output data word is loaded into the output circuit the output line is forced to a predetermined logical level signalling the port the data is available. The port then provides a series of clock pulses to shift the data word out from the output circuit. When the data word is shifted out from the output circuit the circuit returns the output line to the initial state removing the data available signal. The programmable interface controller is responsive to a series of input words as messages from the OCIA type port. The interface controller is operatively connected to a weighing cell for providing weight and status information, and in response to a particular message, returns a message to the OCIA type port providing weight information and status information. In response to other messages, the programmable interface controller enters certain error routines, clears the interface to initial conditions, or resets the weighing cell to zero. The messages are provided in a predetermined format having header words descriptive of the meassage contents and ending in an error check word. The EOM bit of the error check word is of an opposite logical level from the EOM bit of the other words in a message and so indicates the end of the message.",PITNEY BOWES INC,MALLOZZI JOSEPH;;DINAN DAVID E;;DANIELS EDWARD P,PITNEY BOWES INC.

SOLUTION: A data management system ranks priority order of the data reconstruction, based on the weakest data redundancy system identified in a storage system in response to the fault of a storage device. The ranking of the priority order of the data reconstruction is provided with a step for reconstructing the weakest data redundancy system, more preferentially than the reconstruction of the other data redundancy systems in the system. The weakest data redundancy system is decided, by comparing the probabilities of losing data preventable by the reconstruction of the respective data redundancy systems inside the storage system from the view point of the possibility that one or more disks in the system will fail next. The probabilities of the data loss for the respective data redundancy systems are decided, by taking into consideration the characteristics accompanying the storage system and the storage device.",HEWLETT PACKARD CO,MOHAMED BERUHADEI;;ROGER D DANIELS;;DAVID K ANBERGER,,https://lens.org/185-924-218-033-956,Patent Application,no,0,16,2,2,0,G06F11/1092;;G06F11/1092,G06F12/16;;G06F3/06;;G06F11/00;;G06F11/10,,0,0,,,,PENDING

A comparator compares this signal to a reference voltage that is related to the current level to be detected. This reference voltage is adjustable based on the voltage applied by the regulator and the voltage being ultimately supplied as the DC output voltage. The comparator and a capacitor perform an integration function that results in a voltage that ramps upward if the current threshold is being exceeded.

Call records from a switch are scanned to identify a fraudulent cellular phone based on its behavior. An identifier, e.g., a radio frequency (RF) signature, representative of the fraudulent phone is stored in a control channel editor at a cell site. A database of identifiers may comprise a positive validation database storing the identifiers for all valid phones used in the cellular telephone system, or it may be a negative validation database storing the identifiers for known fraudulent phones. A control channel editor intercepts a call origination request transmitted by a phone, and a control processor compares one or more characteristics of the phone transmitting the call origination request to the database of identifiers. The control processor then prevents the call origination request from completing when the comparison indicates that the phone is fraudulent. The call origination request can be prevented from completing by (1) re-routing the call to a customer service or ""fraud hot line"" number, (2) interrupting the call origination request, (3) transmitting a ""hang-up"" message to the phone, (4) transmitting a ""hang-up"" message to the cell site, or (5) transmitting a ""tear-down"" message to a switch.",CELLCO PARTNERSHIP DBA VERIZON,RUDOKAS RONALD STEVEN;;STORCH JOHN ADAM;;DANIELS DAVID LEIGHTON,CELLCO PARTNERSHIP INC (2000-04-03),https://lens.org/030-350-798-339-861,Granted Patent,yes,107,123,5,7,0,H04W12/06;;H04W12/06;;H04M15/00;;H04M15/00;;H04M15/47;;H04M15/47;;H04M2215/0148;;H04M2215/0148;;H04M2215/32;;H04M2215/32;;H04W12/126;;H04W12/126,H04M15/00;;H04W12/06;;H04W12/12,455/410;;455/411;;455/560;;379/114;;379/115;;379/189,15,4,050-484-475-284-148;;072-930-065-589-016;;044-242-594-764-153;;072-930-065-589-016,10.1109/pimrc.1992.279930;;10.1109/glocom.1993.318141;;10.1109/vetec.1993.510954;;10.1109/glocom.1993.318141,"""Seamless Security Needed to Beat New Forms of Wireless Fraud"", Wireless Week, Oct. 6, 1997.;;Smith, ""Anti-fraud Solutions Increase"", Wireless Week, May 11, 1998.;;Dziatkiewicz, ""The Customer and the Bandit"", Wireless Week, Nov. 16, 199.;;Davis & Goyal, ""Knowledge-based management of Cellular Clone Fraud"", Proceesings PIMRC'92, Third IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Oct. 19, 1992.;;Lin & Harn, ""Authentication in Wireless Communications"", IEEE, Jan. 1993.;;McCulley & Rappaport, ""Distribuyed real Time Signal processing for Cellular and Paging Traffic Analysis, Fraud Detection, and Intelligent Wireless Network Control"", Vehicular Technology Conference, 1993, 43rd IEEE, May 18, 1993.;;Lin, Harn, ""Authentication in Wireless Communications"", Global Telecommunications Conference, 1993, Nov. 1993.;;Alleven, ""PCS Targets Security"", Wireless Week, Jan. 27, 1997.;;Warner, ""House Passes Wireless Crime Law"", Wireless Week Mar. 9, 1998.;;Mobile Phone News, article, Defense Technologies Cellular Fraud Management, vol. 12, No. 11, Mar. 14, 1994.;;Mobile Phone News, article, ""TRW's Phoneprint Added to Cellular's Anti-fraud Arsenal"", vol. 11, No. 41, Oct. 25, 1993.;;Telephone Engineer & Management, article, ""Cellular Carriers Lose Estimated $300-300 Mil to Fraud"", pp. 62, Dec. 1, 1993.;;Security Technology News, article, ""Cellular Toll Fraud on the Decline"", vol. 2, No. 4, Feb. 22, 1994.;;Abstract (in English) Derwent info Ltds, patent search for English language equaivalent patent family members corresponding to German Patent No. 3402467.;;D.

The fixed pressure casing (  3  ) and the removable pressure casing (  2  ) are coupled together via a joining member (  1  ). During cooling operation the joining member (  1  ) is arranged such that refrigerant fluid flows between the fixed and the removable casings. During servicing the joining member is arranged to cut off flow of refrigerant fluid between the fixed and removable casings, such that refrigerant in the fixed casing is trapped and parts in the removable casing are accessible for servicing. After servicing, substantially pure refrigerant fluid is pumped into the removable casing (  2  ), the fixed and removable casings are re-joined and the joining member (  1  ) is arranged such that refrigerant fluid flows between the casings again.

A light-reflecting flexible sheet 72 is placed in a mould so that its light-reflecting surface 73 is positioned adjacent a male mould forming surface. The forming surface is larger than the sheet. Liquid plastics material is injected into the mould under pressure against the opposite surface of the sheet 72, thus pressing the light-reflecting surface into intimate contact with the forming surface. Because the sheet is smaller, the border 86 of the forming surface is not covered by the sheet Plastics material flows beyond the outer edges of the sheet against the uncovered border of the forming surface. The plastics material solidifies to form a housing having a supporting body overlying the sheet and a shoulder, integral with the supporting body and contiguous with and surrounding the outer edges of the sheet. The shoulder traps the sheet against the underlying supporting body for maintaining the contour of the sheet caused by the monitoring surface. <IMAGE>",EASTMAN KODAK CO,DANIELS STEVEN DAVID;;STONEHAM JEFFREY RICHARD;;ERICKSON JOHN KENNETH,,https://lens.org/009-116-341-331-353,Patent Application,no,0,3,3,14,0,B29C45/14;;B29C45/14;;B29D11/00596;;B29D11/00605;;B29L2011/0083;;F21V7/10;;F21V7/24;;F21V7/24;;F21V7/28;;F21V7/28,B29C45/14;;B29D11/00;;F21V7/10;;F21V7/22,B5A AB19          AB19F;;B5A A1R314C6      AB19F;;B5A A1R400        AB19F;;B5A A1R422        AB19F;;B5A A1R442        AB19F;;B5A A20T14        AB19F;;F4R RCA           RCA;;F4R R223          RCA;;F4R R337          RCA;;F4R R39Y          RCA;;F4R R611          RCA;;F4R R632          RCA;;F4R R653          RCA;;G2X X1K1          X1K1;;U1S S1820;;U1S S1917;;U1S S1929;;U1S S1930;;U1S S1933,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    The invention consists of a sonication and imbibition process for the uptake of water and/or other beneficial substances into a seed. The seed to be treated is immersed in water or other liquids. The seed is exposed to sound energy at frequencies between 15 kHz and 30 kHz for periods between about 1 and 15 minutes. The ultrasonic energy generates cavitational forces by the adiabatic collapse of microbubbles in the liquid medium, particularly those bubbles that collapse at the surface of the seed. The ultrasonic cavitational forces impart an enhanced stable memory for the seeds to imbibe water and/or other substances beneficial to the seed and/or plant. The ultrasonically treated seed can be dried, stored, and later imbibed with a substance that enhances a growth characteristic of the seed or resultant plant. Upon germination, the plant maintains the enhanced growth characteristics. The effect is substantially enhanced by saturating the water with a noble gas such as helium or argon, or combinations of inert gases.

A comparator compares this signal to a reference voltage that is related to the current level to be detected. This reference voltage is adjustable based on the voltage applied by the regulator and the voltage being ultimately supplied as the DC output voltage.

Call records from a switch are scanned to identify a fraudulent cellular phone based on its behavior. An identifier, e.g., a radio frequency (RF) signature, representative of the fraudulent phone is stored in a control channel editor at a cell site. A database of identifiers may comprise a positive validation database storing the identifiers for all valid phones used in the cellular telephone system, or it may be a negative validation database storing the identifiers for known fraudulent phones. A control channel editor intercepts a call origination request transmitted by a phone, and a control processor compares one or more characteristics of the phone transmitting the call origination request to the database of identifiers. The control processor then prevents the call origination request from completing when the comparison indicates that the phone is fraudulent. The call origination request can be prevented from completing by (1) re-routing the call to a customer service or ""fraud hot line"" number, (2) interrupting the call origination request, (3) transmitting a ""hang-up"" message to the phone, (4) transmitting a ""hang-up"" message to the cell site, or (5) transmitting a ""tear-down"" message to a switch.",AIRTOUCH COMMUNICATIONS INC,RUDOKAS RONALD S;;STORCH JOHN A;;DANIELS DAVID L,AIRTOUCH COMMUNICATIONS OF CALIFORNIA (1995-01-03);;CELLCO PARTNERSHIP INC (2000-04-03);;AIRTOUCH COMMUNICATIONS INC (1995-07-17),https://lens.org/082-573-685-126-717,Granted Patent,yes,64,147,5,7,0,H04W12/06;;H04W12/06;;H04M15/00;;H04M15/00;;H04M15/47;;H04M15/47;;H04M2215/0148;;H04M2215/0148;;H04M2215/32;;H04M2215/32;;H04W12/126;;H04W12/126,H04M15/00;;H04W12/06;;H04W12/12,379/59;;379/62;;379/189,5,0,,,"Abstract (in English), Derwent Info Ltd., patent search for English language equivalent patent family members corresponding to German Patent No. 3402467.;;Mobile Phone News, article, Defense Technologies Cellular Fraud Management , vol. 12, No. 11, Mar. 14, 1994.;;Mobile Phone News, article, TRW s Phoneprint Added to Cellular s Anti Fraud Arsenal , vol. 11, No. 41, Oct. 25, 1993.;;Telephone Engineer & Management, article, Cellular Carriers Lose Estimated $300 300 Mil to Fraud , p. 62, Dec. 1, 1993.;;Security Technology News, article, Cellular Toll Fraud on the Decline , vol. 2, No. 4, Feb. 22, 1994.",EXPIRED

This slows the etching process when this pseudo image is reached. The pseudo image may be printed to surround the object polymer image on a printed substrate sheet as a shell that provides notice during the excess substrate removal/cleaning process that the desired polymer image is nearby and extra care must be taken to avoid removal of the desired polymer image. The pseudo image may have a 3D patterned surface that can be recognized by a person doing the sandblasting or recognized automatically by an automated 3D object finisher.SELECTED DRAWING: Figure 1",XEROX CORP,DAVID A MANTELL;;NYSTROM PETER J;;MARC D DANIELS,,https://lens.org/008-600-698-594-20X,Patent Application,no,0,0,6,6,0,B29C64/153;;B29C64/386;;B29C64/393;;B29C64/20;;B29C64/35;;B29C64/321;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y30/00;;B33Y50/00;;B33Y50/02;;B33Y40/20;;B33Y40/00;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y30/00;;B29C64/147;;B29C64/223;;B29C64/165;;B33Y40/20;;B29C64/40;;B33Y40/00;;B29C64/165;;B29C64/188;;B29C43/006;;B29C64/205;;B29C64/386;;B29C64/393;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y30/00;;B33Y40/00;;B33Y50/00;;B33Y50/02;;B33Y70/00;;B33Y99/00;;B33Y40/20;;B29C64/165;;B29C64/245;;B29C64/205;;B33Y40/00;;B33Y30/00;;B33Y10/00;;B29C64/35,B29C64/165;;B29C64/147;;B29C64/205;;B29C64/245;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y30/00,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

An additive manufacturing system and method for improving the certainty of removing oretching excess substrate from a stack of printed substrate slices to arrive at the 3D object. The method includes the steps: printing a pseudo image as a shell layer around a desired object slice with less polymer (e.g., thermoplastic) material than the 3D object solid layer slice. This slows the etching process when this pseudo image is reached. The pseudo image may be printed to surround the object polymer image on a printed substrate sheet as a shell that provides notice during the excess substrate removal/cleaning process that the desired polymer image is nearby and extra care must be taken to avoid removal of the desired polymer image.

Call records from a switch are scanned to identify a fraudulent cellular phone based on its behavior.

A database of identifiers may comprise a positive validation database storing the identifiers for all valid phones used in the cellular telephone system, or it may be a negative validation database storing the identifiers for known fraudulent phones. A control channel editor intercepts a call origination request transmitted by a phone, and a control processor compares one or more characteristics of the phone transmitting the call origination request to the database of identifiers. The control processor then prevents the call origination request from completing when the comparison indicates that the phone is fraudulent. The call origination request can be prevented from completing by (1) re-routing the call to a customer service or ""fraud hot line"" number, (2) interrupting the call origination request, (3) transmitting a ""hang-up"" message to the phone, (4) transmitting a ""hang-up"" message to the cell site, or (5) transmitting a ""tear-down"" message to a switch",AIRTOUCH COMMUNICATIONS,RUDOKAS RONALD S;;STORCH JOHN A;;DANIELS DAVID L,AIRTOUCH COMMUNICATIONS OF CALIFORNIA (1995-01-03);;CELLCO PARTNERSHIP INC (2000-04-03);;AIRTOUCH COMMUNICATIONS INC (1995-07-17),https://lens.org/159-577-102-109-06X,Granted Patent,yes,25,192,5,7,0,H04W12/06;;H04W12/06;;H04M15/00;;H04M15/00;;H04M15/47;;H04M15/47;;H04M2215/0148;;H04M2215/0148;;H04M2215/32;;H04M2215/32;;H04W12/126;;H04W12/126,H04M15/00;;H04W12/06;;H04W12/12,379/59;;379/58;;455/33.1,4,0,,,"Mobile Phone News Article, Defense Tecnologies Employed for Cellular Fraud Management , vol. 12, No. 11, Mar. 14, 1994.;;Mobile Phone News Article, TRW s Phoneprint Added to Cellular s Anti Fraud Arsenal , vol. 11, No. 41, Oct. 25, 1993.;;Telephone Engineer & Management Article, Cellular Carriers Lose Estimated $100 300 Mil to Fraud , p. 62, Dec. 1, 1993.;;Security Technology News Article, Cellular Toll Fraud on the Decline , vol. 2, No. 4, Feb. 22, 1994.",EXPIRED

An ultrasonic transducer (16) is mounted to have a field of emission outside of the detector, and through ambient air, and a processor (19) monitors ultrasonic return values and processes them to determine object presence and/or distance data, and to detect ambient air instability either before or as part of a detection operation. The processor records a return signal amplitude value for each sample point, and quantifies variance across the values, and if the variance exceeds a threshold it determines that there is excessive ambient air instability for accurate detection. The detector may be incorporated in an alarm device (1), in which it is used to determine if an obstacle has been placed in a position to block flow of air to the sensor such as a smoke sensor.

Thereafter further sealant may be injected via the delivery channel after the skin is formed to enhance the ingress of sealant within the crack.,RCSM ENTPR PTY LTD,DANIELS EOIN;;SHARKEY CLAIRE;;HOE CRAIG;;O'BRIEN MARTIN;;WHITEHEAD DAVID,RCSM ENTERPRISES PTY LTD (2022-12-22),https://lens.org/158-507-564-625-966,Granted Patent,no,5,0,6,6,0,E04G23/0211;;E04G23/02;;E21B33/138;;E04B1/648;;E02D37/00;;E02D31/02;;C09K3/10;;C09K2200/0607;;C09K2200/0226;;E21D9/002;;E02B3/16;;C09K2200/0221;;E04G23/0211;;E02B3/16;;E02B3/10;;E21D11/38;;E04G23/0211,E04G23/02,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

An ultrasonic transducer (16) is mounted to have a field of emission outside of the detector, and through ambient air, and a processor (19) monitors ultrasonic return values and processes them to determine object presence and/or distance data, and to detect ambient air instability either before or as part of a detection operation. The processor records a return signal amplitude value for each sample point, and quantifies variance across the values, and if the variance exceeds a threshold it determines that there is excessive ambient air instability for accurate detection. The detector may be incorporated in an alarm device (1), in which it is used to determine if an obstacle has been placed in a position to block flow of air to the sensor such as a smoke sensor.

   A treatment system is provided for liquefied livestock waste contained in a slurry pit of a livestock confinement building or lagoon. Waste slurry is pumped through a sonication chamber where it is treated with ultrasound and energy density. The configuration of sonicator probes, the duration of treatment, and the sonication chamber design subject the animal waster therein to maximum sonic cavitation. The treatment should be such that the particle size of the waste is sufficiently reduced to suspend or dissolve the particles permanently, which greatly enhances the speed of biodegradation. Where the pits are under confinement buildings, the waste slurry may be recycled after treatment back into the slurry pit. In other cases, the waste slurry may be treated and then passed to a transient storage tank for trapping methane, and then to a lagoon, or passed directly to a lagoon.

In an embodiment, in response to a particular memory location being pushed into a first register within a first register space, the first set of electronic circuits accesses a descriptor stored at the particular memory location. The descriptor indicates a width of a column of tabular data, a number of rows of tabular data, and one or more tabular data manipulation operations to perform on the column of tabular data. The descriptor also indicates a source memory location for accessing the tabular data and a destination memory location for storing data manipulation result from performing the one or more data manipulation operations on the tabular data. Based on the descriptor, the first set of electronic circuits determines control information indicating that the one or more data manipulation operations are to be performed on the tabular data and transmits the control information, using a hardware data channel, to a second set of electronic circuits to perform the one or more operations. Based on the control information, the second set of electronic circuits retrieve the tabular data from source memory location and apply the one or more data manipulation operations to generate the data manipulation result. The second set of electronic circuits cause the data manipulation result to be stored at the destination memory location.

The descriptor indicates a width of a column of tabular data, a number of rows of tabular data, and one or more tabular data manipulation operations to perform on the column of tabular data. The descriptor also indicates a source memory location for accessing the tabular data and a destination memory location for storing data manipulation result from performing the one or more data manipulation operations on the tabular data. Based on the descriptor, the first set of electronic circuits determines control information indicating that the one or more data manipulation operations are to be performed on the tabular data and transmits the control information, using a hardware data channel, to a second set of electronic circuits to perform the one or more operations. Based on the control information, the second set of electronic circuits retrieve the tabular data from source memory location and apply the one or more data manipulation operations to generate the data manipulation result. The second set of electronic circuits cause the data manipulation result to be stored at the destination memory location.

The data movement system includes multiple data movement engines, each dedicated to moving and transforming tabular data from main memory data to a subset of the core processors. Each data movement engine is coupled to an internal memory that stores data (e.g. a bit vector) that dictates how data manipulation operations are performed on tabular data moved from a main memory to the memories of a core processor, or to and from other memories. The internal memory of each data movement engine is private to the data movement engine. Tabular data is efficiently copied between internal memories of the data movement system via a copy ring that is coupled to the internal memories of the data movement system and/or is coupled to a data movement engine. Also, a data movement engine internally broadcasts data to other data movement engines, which then transfer the data to respective core processors. Partitioning may also be performed by the hardware of the data movement system. Techniques are used to partition data “in flight”.
