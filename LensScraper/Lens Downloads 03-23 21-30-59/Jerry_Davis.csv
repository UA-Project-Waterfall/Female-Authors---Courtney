   Police officers have had many improvements in their equipment in recent years, except in one constant area. They often struggle with the removal of equipment from their utility belts and are unable to put the items into action quickly and easily. This invention relates generally to easy, quick access to the items held on a police officer's belt. This is especially common to non-lethal weapons and ammo clips, but not limited to these in any way. From this point on the term officer will refer to a police officer.

    A method that increases the volume of fresh air into hatchers (  10  ) during the last 24 hours before chicks are pulled from the hatcher (  10  ). This method increases the volume of fresh air into the hatcher (  10  ), while at the same time not upsetting the preset internal temperature and humidity settings inside the hatcher (  10  ). This is done by gradually increasing the hatcher hallway room (  24  ) temperature, humidity and air pressure at predetermined times to predetermined settings during the final 24 hours of the three day hatch cycle, which causes the damper door (  22  ) on top of the hatcher (  10  ) to open and stay open, thereby allowing a greater volume of fresh air to be forced into the hatcher (  10  ). Due to the increased air pressure, excess carbon dioxide is exhausted out the back of the hatcher (  10  ) through the exhaust vents (  18  ) dropping the carbon dioxide level to the lowest level possible to benefit newly hatch chicks.

The system generates time-varying signals corresponding to the vertical acceleration of the front and rear wheels. The front and rear wheel signals include corresponding perturbations caused by the wheels crossing road disturbances such as bumps. A time lag occurs between perturbations in the rear wheel signal and corresponding perturbations in the front wheel signal. An adaptive algorithm correlates the signals for various time delay values until a time delay value is determined which maximizes the correlation between the two signals. The calculated time delay value corresponds to the actual time lag between the front and rear wheels occurring before the rear wheels encounter a road disturbance previously encountered by the front wheels.

At each base station, the transmissions are sensed and compressed while reversing the frequency modulation at the mobile station in a mirror image relation to produce a near replica of the pulse. The pulse is synchronously processed for production of a control pulse precisely at the peak of the replica. The control pulse initiates a like transmission from the base station to the mobile station.

   A fin disengagement device for limiting the range of a projectile uses an electronic safe and arm circuit to sense launch and spin levels. Once armed, the stored energy from the electronic safe and arm circuit is dumped into an initiator or directly to explosive bolts. The initiator ignites an energetic material to separate the fin from the projectile in-flight at a predetermined time. Alternatively, the explosive bolts separate the fin from the projectile in-flight at a predetermined time. In the embodiments using an initiator and energetic material, an opening or cavity in the rear portion of the projectile body or rod adapter acts as a pressure chamber. When enough pressure has built up from the burning of the energetic material, the front hub of the fin section expands enough to disengage the threads and separates the fin section from the projectile body.

    A fin disengagement device for limiting the range of a projectile uses an electronic safe and arm circuit to sense launch and spin levels. Once armed, the stored energy from the electronic safe and arm circuit is dumped into an initiator or directly to explosive bolts. The initiator ignites an energetic material to separate the fin from the projectile in-flight at a predetermined time. Alternatively, the explosive bolts separate the fin from the projectile in-flight at a predetermined time. In the embodiments using an initiator and energetic material, an opening or cavity in the rear portion of the projectile body or rod adapter acts as a pressure chamber. When enough pressure has built up from the burning of the energetic material, the front hub of the fin section expands enough to disengage the threads and separates the fin section from the projectile body.

In one example, this platform allows interconnected physical resources such as processors, memory, network interfaces and storage interfaces to be abstracted and mapped to virtual resources (e.g., virtual mainframes, virtual partitions). Virtual resources contained in a virtual partition can be assembled into virtual servers that execute a guest operating system (e.g., Linux). In one example, the abstraction is unique in that any resource is available to any virtual server regardless of the physical boundaries that separate the resources. For example, any number of physical processors or any amount of physical memory can be used by a virtual server even if these resources span different nodes. A virtual computing platform is provided that allows for the creation, deletion, modification, control (e.g., start, stop, suspend, resume) and status (i.e., events) of the virtual servers which execute on the virtual computing platform and the management capability provides controls for these functions. In a particular example, such a platform allows the number and type of virtual resources consumed by a virtual server to be scaled up or down when the virtual server is running. For instance, an administrator may scale a virtual server manually or may define one or more policies that automatically scale a virtual server. Further, using the management API, a virtual server can monitor itself and can scale itself up or down depending on its need for processing, memory and I/O resources. For example, a virtual server may monitor its CPU utilization and invoke controls through the management API to allocate a new processor for itself when its utilization exceeds a specific threshold. Conversely, a virtual server may scale down its processor count when its utilization falls. Policies can be used to execute one or more management controls. More specifically, a management capability is provided that allows policies to be defined using management object's properties, events and/or method results. A management policy may also incorporate external data (e.g., an external event) in its definition. A policy may be triggered, causing the management server or other computing entity to execute an action. An action may utilize one or more management controls. In addition, an action may access external capabilities such as sending notification e-mail or sending a text message to a telephone paging system. Further, management capability controls may be executed using a discrete transaction referred to as a “job.” A series of management controls may be assembled into a job using one or management interfaces. Errors that occur when a job is executed may cause the job to be rolled back, allowing affected virtual servers to return to their original state.",PLOUFFE JERRY;;DAVIS SCOTT H.;;VASILEVSKY ALEXANDER D.;;THOMAS BENJAMIN J.III;;NOYES STEVEN S.;;HAZEL TOM,PLOUFFE JERRY;;DAVIS SCOTT H;;VASILEVSKY ALEXANDER D;;THOMAS BENJAMIN J III;;NOYES STEVEN S;;HAZEL TOM,VIRTUAL IRON SOFTWARE INC (2005-01-07);;KATANA TECHNOLOGIES INC (2005-01-10),https://lens.org/129-972-392-002-78X,Patent Application,yes,65,1369,4,10,0,G06F9/45537;;G06F9/4856;;G06F9/505;;G06F9/5083;;G06F9/5077;;G06F9/5083;;G06F9/45537;;G06F9/4856;;G06F9/505;;G06F9/5077;;G06F9/455;;G06F9/45533;;G06F9/45558;;G06F9/50,G06F9/455;;G06F9/50,711/1,1,1,106-125-293-362-112,10.1145/354871.354873,"Govil et al.

In a first embodiment very small contacts (36) are arrayed on a flat mating surface (28) of the connector body (22). Contacts (36) are raised slightly above the mating surface by plating conductive metal to form raised bumps (42) on one of a pair of connectors (14, 16). Insulated individual conductors (26) are placed through apertures (48) defined in a substrate acting as a template, and are fastened in place by potting material (50) before shaping the mating surface (28) of the connector body (22) or (24) is shaped. Pin and socket combinations (30, 32) are used to align mating connectors with each other. In other connectors (176, 178) contact bases (198, 200) to be plated may be defined precisely by photoresist lithography on a cover layer (192) attached to the template substrate (180, 182), and an elastomeric layer (190 ) may be provided between the cover layer and the template substrate. In other connectors (90, 146, 240, 460) shields of coaxial conductor pairs and shields of flex circuits are connected electrically to conductive common layers (98, 154, 246, 474) on the rear side of the substrate.

In one embodiment of the present invention, whole fruits are fed into a dual turret extraction apparatus that includes a plurality of matched resilient cups for holding the fruit. After the fruit is cut in half, the halves are indexed through successive coring and reaming stations. The coring station includes a coring element that cleanly extracts a hemisperical section of fruit meat from the peel. The reaming station includes a reaming element that gently removes any fruit meat remaining within the peel. The fruit meat sections are then fed into rag separator apparatus that uses a rotating screen drum and a counterrotating shaft having striker bars projecting radially therefrom to strip the juice sacs from the sectional membranes. The resultant juice/juice sac slurry is then deposited on the upper surface of an inclined vibrating bed that causes the seeds to bounce and tumble down the bed while the juice sacs travel up the bed to a point where they are collected.",PROCTER & GAMBLE,KOLODESH MICHAEL S;;CASH JR WALTER;;DAVIS JERRY E;;GOSSELIN PETER G;;KOCK RONALD W;;PIERSON BRUCE A;;REIBOLDT H NORMAN;;SABATELLI DAVID A;;TOMS DOUGLAS,SD IP HOLDINGS COMPANY (2004-08-01);;PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY THE (1988-06-27);;BEVERAGES HOLDINGS LLC (2004-08-01),https://lens.org/081-957-236-272-483,Granted Patent,yes,57,37,1,1,0,A23N1/003;;A23N4/18;;A23N4/18;;A23N1/003,A23N1/00;;A23N4/18,426/482;;99/502;;99/504;;99/516;;99/540;;426/489;;426/518,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
