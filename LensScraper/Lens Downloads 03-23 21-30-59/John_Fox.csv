When the total thickness of bonding metal between the bodies must be small, for example, less than 1 micrometre when bonding a block of an acoustic medium to a piezoelectric element in order that the acoustic losses in the bond material should be acceptable, the surfaces of the bond material must be quite clean when the bond is established. The layers of the malleable metal are produced from an evaporation source 20, 21, 22 which is situated below both the bonding surfaces in order to mitigate deposition of spits on the bonding surfaces. The pressure bond between the two bodies is established inside the evaporation chamber 19 without exposing the bonding surfaces of the malleable metal to the ambient atmosphere. This is achieved by employing a jig formed in two parts 1, 3 linked by articulated links 5. Both parts holding the respective bodies, are initially suspended over the evaporation source (Figure 1), then, before pressing, one part 3 is pushed off the carrier rod 12 by a lever 14 and falls into position (Figure 4) below the first part 1. <IMAGE>",PHILIPS ELECTRONIC ASSOCIATED,FOX ALAN JOHN,,https://lens.org/053-192-377-610-83X,Patent Application,no,0,3,4,4,0,B23K35/001;;B23K20/02,B23K20/02;;B23K35/00,B3R RPP           RPP,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Light e.g. of wavelength 0.3-6 Ám for KTN, may be directed through the crystal in a direction which is not parallel to the crystallographic axes and which is not normal to the field direction. The light and field may be applied in substantially parallel directions and a maximum effect is then obtained when that direction is at 45 degrees to the crystal axes. Thus in Fig. 1 (not shown) such a crystal is disposed between crossed polarizers and has electroded (0, 11) faces perpendicular to the optic axis. In one embodiment, monochromatic light is intensity modulated by applying voltage pulses to the crystal and detected by an indium antimonide detector. The amplitude of such pulses may be reduced if a D.C. bias is also applied due to the square law dependence of the retardation. If the light source is broad band, the crystal and polarizers may form a variable filter. In a light deflector, Fig. 3, plane polarized light is passed through a series of such crystals interleaved with a series of uniaxial crystals e.g. of calcite, which are orientated so that their privileged directions are at 45 degrees to those of the preceding and following active crystals. Each uniaxial crystal has half the thickness of the preceding uniaxial crystal, so that application of a half wave voltage to one of the active crystals results in the appropriate binary deflection. Such an arrangement may be used for a display on a screen, of for addressing an optical storage bank such as an array of photo-diodes.

[Also in Division F4] A method of making a finned heat exchanger member comprises extruding a metal tube formed with fins projecting from either an internal or an external surface thereof, axially splitting the tube into at least two sections, removing the curvature from each of the sections and forming and joining two such sections so as to define a tubular passage therebetween. An aluminium tube 1 is extruded with fins 2 and regions 3 having no fins. Alternatively corresponding regions may be cleared of fins at a later stage if no fin free regions are originally provided. The extruded tube is cropped into rings, the axial length of which corresponds to the width w of the passages to be formed. The rings are than split along line A-A, flattened and then the fin free edges formed into flanges 4a. Apertured bosses 5 may be pressed into the end flanges which are bonded together by welding or by an adhesive. A number of passageways are stacked and joined together at the bosses 5 to form a radiator core either by welding or by bolts, with sealing rings being provided if necessary. In an alternative construction the ends of the tubular passageways are located in apertures in tube plates forming parts of end tanks.",ASS ENG LTD,FOX JOHN ROLAND,,https://lens.org/100-206-071-383-918,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B21D53/02;;B21C23/10;;F28F1/12,B21C23/10;;B21D53/02;;F28F1/12,B3A A122J         AZ;;B3A A122K         AZ;;B3A A122L         AZ;;B3A A158          AZ;;B3A A78A          AZ;;F4S S4E2B         S4(F;;F4S S4F1          S4(F;;F4S S4F2          S4(F;;F4S S4J1A         S4(F,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The method comprises clamping together a pair of the flexible plastic strips between clamps (40,41) at a seal area in the region intended to form an end of the strips, the clamps (40a,40b) having pockets (41a,41b) therein adjacent the profile elements at the seal area. The profile elements are severed and heated at the seal area with a heated knife (45) to transform the severed ends of the profile elements into molten material; the molten material is pressed into the pockets in the clamps (40,41) with the heated knife (45) thereby increasing the thickness of an area of the strips adjacent the seal area to provide a protruding end stop for preventing movement of the slider past the ends of the bag (30). <IMAGE>",MOBIL OIL CORP,HERRINGTON FOX JOHN,TENNECO PACKAGING INC.

STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES Ltd. Dec. 11, 1964, No. 50522/64. Heading H1K. In a method of making a semi-conductor device a semi-conductor body is etched to remove surface contamination, and subsequently lifetime reducing impurity is applied to the surface of the body and diffused into the body. The semi-conductor body must be protected from the action of light between these two steps because the action of light gives rise to surface conditions which inhibit the introduction of lifetime reducing impurities. Resultant devices would have random variations in their switching properties. In the embodiment described silicon slices containing partially formed planar transistors are individually subjected to the following treatment which was carried out in subdued lighting. Each slice is cleaned in boiling concentrated sulphuric acid, washed in de-ionized water, etched in aqueous ammonium bifluoride to remove any oxide film, washed with de-ionized water, and blown dry with an air jet. (At this stage the slices may be stored in the dark in water or in a solution containing free hydrofluoric acid.) Still in subdued lighting the slices are loaded in a vacuum evaporator and gold deposited on one surface of each of the slices and diffused in. A similar treatment may be given to germanium devices but an alternative oxide-removing etchant to aqueous ammonium bifluoride may be needed.",STANDARD TELEPHONES CABLES LTD,FOX JOHN COLIN,,https://lens.org/169-434-854-948-004,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,H01L21/02052;;H01L21/00,H01L21/00;;H01L21/306,H1K KMW           MW;;H1K K1CX          MW;;H1K K2S1B         MW;;H1K K2S10         MW;;H1K K2S11G        MW;;H1K K2S2P         MW;;H1K K2S20         MW;;H1K K3E1M         MW;;H1K K3TY          MW;;H1K K3T5A         MW;;H1K K3T5Y         MW;;H1K K3W           MW;;H1K K5B2          MW;;H1K K9N1          MW;;H1K K9R           MW,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Metal strip 27 fed into the die set is guided by rollers 26. When in use the pins 28 and 48 are pressed against each other. First the pins 48, sliding in housing 37, push a backing plate 41 against the spring assemblies 42 thus relieving the spring load exerted through pins 51 on the ejector 49, the strip being held between the die 39 and the stripper plate. As the die set closes further the stripper plate is depressed, Fig. 6, the punch 16 enters the die aperture and a blank 52 is punched out. As the die set opens the stripper plate first rises due to the spring assemblies 19 removing the strip from the punch, the blank 52 being retained in the die aperture. With further opening of the die set, the pins 48 fall, their flanged heads dropping into recesses 37a in the housing 37 thus lowering the backing plate 41 and allowing the springs 42 to re-apply their load through pins 51 to the ejector 49. To produce a central hole and three holes equispaced from the central hole and each other in the blank 52, punches 46 and 47 mounted in the die 39 co-operate with apertures 17 and 18 respectively in the punch 16.

Direct steam-pressure apparatus; vacuum apparatus.-Relates to improvements in pumps in which the raising of water is effected by the formation, alternately, of a vacuum and a pressure in excess of that of the atmosphere in a chamber, which, in its lower portion, is in communication through a non-return suction valve with a lowlying source of water supply and, at its upper end, is connected to a steam-supply pipe, there being at this part a valve, which automatically opens when the chamber is filled with water and closes when the water has been displaced by steam and ejected through a non-delivery valve. Fig. 1 is a section of the pump along the line 1-1 of Fig. 2, and Fig. 2 a section along the line 2-2 of Fig. 1. The converging vessels h, placed within the chambers a, lead to the delivery valves d and are made of thin sheet metal, which may be corrugated to increase the surface. When the water in the upper part of the chamber is forced out through the tube h by steam admitted through the valve f, the portion below the level i, i remains, and the steam within the tube h is readily condensed. The tube h also serves to still the water entering the chamber. The rapid condensation is still further brought about by the injection of cold water through the tube k from a cylinder j in communication with both chambers and having an easy-fitting piston, which is actuated, according to the difference in pressure between the two chambers, every time the valve f moves. The motion of this valve is automatic, as, when one chamber has filled with water, a vacuum is just being produced in the other, and the valve travels over accordingly. To regulate the amount of steam admitted each time, the seating g<1> of the valve can be screwed in or out. The cover u can also be raised from time to time so as still to keep the ball f in position after it has worn.",FOX HENRY JOHN,FOX HENRY JOHN,,https://lens.org/030-494-326-490-582,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The device may have User Equipment UE functionality. In one aspect, the device acts as a relay between a first base station and a network. The device detects signals transmitted by base stations in the network, identifies and excludes the first base station, selects one of the remaining base stations based on the properties of the detected signals and establishes a connection with the selected base station. This connection then forms the backhaul link for the first base station, via the relay device. In another aspect the device causes the first base station to interrupt its transmissions while the device detects signals from other base stations. In another aspect, a control device initiates suppression of transmit signals from base stations while detecting signals transmitted from the remaining base stations. This allows a device to be deployed as a relay without requiring any network management and may be used to provide backhaul for a baste station that is deployed in a nomadic or moving platform where the network environment may be continually changing.",DELTENNA LTD,ANDREW JOHN FOX,,https://lens.org/159-995-283-271-307,Patent Application,no,2,0,10,10,0,H04B7/15507;;H04W88/04;;H04W84/005;;H04B7/15507;;H04B17/318;;H04B7/043;;H04B7/0695;;H04B7/15571;;H04W40/12;;H04W48/20,H04W84/00;;H04W88/04,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

[Also in Division G2] A camera [see Division G2-G3] for photographing the interior of the large intestine of the human body has a longitudinal bore 39 through which passes a flexible rod 43 which acts as a guide for movement of the camera. Initially, a hollow flexible tube 201, within which is disposed a rod 225 having a radioopaque tip 227, is introduced into the colon, X-ray screening being employed to determine the position of the tip. When the desired position is reached, the rod 225 is withdrawn, and replaced by the guide rod 43. When this is in position, the tube 201 is withdrawn, the camera itself then being inserted along the guide rod, being manipulated by a nylon tube 45 attached to a part 41 of the camera. Air may be introduced through tube 45 to inflate the colon prior to photographing. (While the tube 201 is still in position, it may be used for introducing a device for removing tissue from the colon.)",NAT RES DEV,FOX JOHN ADRIAN,,https://lens.org/011-488-885-051-260,Granted Patent,no,0,1,2,2,0,A61B1/04;;A61B1/04,A61B1/04,A5R RB16A         -;;A5R R93           -;;A5R R95           -;;G2A AAF           AF;;G2A AAS           AAS;;G2A AASA          AAS;;G2A A401          AF;;G2A A403          AF;;G2A A433          AF;;G2A A453          AF;;G2A A454          AF;;G2A A459          AF;;G2A A474          AF;;G2A A497          AAS;;G2A A497          AF;;G2A A500          AF;;G2A A572          AF;;G2A A574          AF;;G2A A625          AF;;G2A A671          AF;;G2A A723          AF,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

This is overcome by operating at least one of the lasers at an elevated gas pressure thus increasing the lasing amplification bandwidth. Thus a waveguide CO z  laser can be used as the amplifier but the power available is limited.

    A user defines their own call-coverage path (  141  ) or other call-processing information by drawing a graphical flowchart (  200  ) using an interactive GUI of a PC-based software application (  140  ). Once the flowchart is drawn, it is activated with the push of a button, and that flowchart is now the logic that is applied to a user's coverage path. The call-coverage path (the flowchart) remains resident on the user's PC (  103  ) and the communications switching system (  101  ) retrieves call-coverage information from the PC whenever it must perform call coverage for that user. A plurality of different flowcharts may be drawn and stored on the PC, and then recalled and activated at any time as the present call-coverage path for the user. A call-coverage path may be activated by and/or for the user from anywhere on a LAN (  104  ), WAN, or the Internet, so that the call-coverage path my be controlled remotely. Furthermore, the coverage-path system has the ability to consult with an on-line personal scheduling system  145  (such as a calendar program) executing on the user's PC or another machine networked with the user's PC. A call-coverage path may then be administered to contain logic (  203  ) that refers to the personal scheduling system to obtain data, rather than having to have the data defined within the coverage-path system itself.

The fluid supply system (10) includes a demand valve (13) connected in series in a supply line (11). The demand valve (13) is attached to a control line (14) which leads control fluid to a diversion valve (15) located in a sump (16). The demand valve (13) can operate either under upstream or downstream control to activate the diversion (15). In order to avoid inadvertent operation of the diversion valve the demand valve (13) includes a control valve member (33) and a pressure plate (32) which permits a small flow of fluid along the line such as may be experienced by a dripping tap. When the flow along the supply line exceeds a predetermined level the demand valve operates to divert control fluid to the diversion valve (15) to fill a variable volume chamber (48) and thereby unseat a diversion valve member (45) to open the diversion valve (15). The diversion valve (15) includes a needle valve (55) to control the bleed of fluid from the variable volume chamber (48) at a predetermined rate as the diversion valve closes so there is a time delay between shut off of the demand valve (13) and closure of the diversion valve (15). The time delay is to allow for excess run-off of waste fluid from the washdown facility.,FOX JOHN M,FOX JOHN M,TRADE WASTE DIVERSION PTY.

Surging of the mercury is also minimized by fixing in the opening limb of the tube a plug having a reduced passage, and, to facilitate transit, a removable plug may be inserted above the mercury. The open limb of a U-tube d is fitted with a cap f, cemented on, passing through a plate b and secured by a nut f<1>. The metal case b is fixed to a back board a and supports the tube d.

MULLARD Ltd. 22 June, 1967, No. 28909/67. Heading H4F. A light modulator comprises a multi-cavity microwave slow-wave structure having electrooptical material, e.g. ADP, disposed in a plurality of the cavities, the structure being arranged to impart to microwaves of a given frequency coupled into end of said structure, a phase velocity which is the same as the phase velocity of light directed along a path which successively passes through the material in each cavity. As shown, Fig. 1, the structure may comprise a circular waveguide closed for microwaves by terminating discs 2 and 3 and provided internally with spaced apertured transverse discs 4-8 and 26 which form ends of cavities 9-14 and 27. The electro-optical material may be in the form of a rod 15, or as an alternative it may be in the form of discrete portions provided within each cavity, the portions being optically matched to one another by a second transparent material, e.g. Canada Bolsam, which interconnects the electrooptical material in each adjacent pair of cavities and passes through the apertures in the intervening discs. A standing wave may be set up with its electric vector extending longitudinally along the structure and hence along the ADP rod, and laser light polarized parallel to x <SP>1</SP> or y<SP>1</SP> passing along path P will be phase-modulated at the microwave frequency. The structure need not be resonant at the input modulation frequency, in which case the structure is terminated at its output end by a matched load 25 (shown dotted). The structure may be made up from a series of identical silver-plated brass sections each containing one transverse disc, the sections being brazed together. To provide amplitude modulated light a quarter wave plate and an analyser are provided at the output of the slowwave structure Fig. 2 (not shown).",MULLARD LTD,FOX ALAN JOHN;;MANSELL JOHN REVERE,,https://lens.org/102-714-593-420-249,Granted Patent,no,0,4,1,1,0,G02F1/0344,G02F1/03,G1A ACEX          CEX4;;G2F FCE           FCE;;G2F F21X          FCE;;G2F F21X          11;;G2F F23E          FCE;;G2F F23E          11;;G2F F23R          FCE;;G2F F23R          11;;G2F F25P1         FCE;;G2F F25P1         11;;G2F F25S          FCE;;G2F F25S          11,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The assembly (10) includes a Variable Camber Kreuger (VCK) panel which is hingedly attached at a forward end to a bullnose (38). Forward and aft suspension links (18,22) serve to suspend the leading edge assembly (10) within a recessed area in a lower surface of an airfoil (12) in a cruise position. A linkage assembly (44) operably associated with the forward and aft suspension links (18,22) causes the VCK panel to be rotated from its cruise position into a take-off or a landing position in a manner which prevents scooping of air into the recessed area of the airfoil (12) during this extending movement. A forwardmost edge of the panel (42) overlaps a portion of the bullnose (38), to thus eliminate the need for a seal at this interface when the assembly is in the landing or the take-off positions. When in the take-off position, a trailing edge (42b) of the VCK panel overlaps an upper, forward edge of the airfoil (12) to eliminate the need for a seal at this interface. When in the take-off position, the linkage elements (44) supporting the assembly form a rigid, strong, truss-type load structure, thus requiring a lesser degree of torque to be imparted by an actuator associated with the airfoil to hold the leading edge assembly (10) in the take-off position during take-off.",BOEING CO,SAKURAI SEIYA;;FOX STEPHEN JOHN,,https://lens.org/190-018-583-390-253,Patent Application,yes,0,0,6,6,0,B64C3/50;;B64C3/50,B64C3/50,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A leading edge assembly for an airfoil. The assembly includes a Variable Camber Kreuger (VCK) panel which is hingedly attached at a forward end to a bullnose. Forward and aft suspension links serve to suspend the leading edge assembly within a recessed area in a lower surface of an airfoil in a cruise position. A linkage assembly operably associated with the forward and aft suspension links causes the VCK panel to be rotated from its cruise position into a take-off or a landing position in a manner which prevents scooping of air into the recessed area of the airfoil during this extending movement. A forwardmost edge of the panel overlaps a portion of the bullnose, to thus eliminate the need for a seal at this interface when the assembly is in the landing or the take-off positions. When in the take-off position, a trailing edge of the VCK panel overlaps an upper, forward edge of the airfoil to eliminate the need for a seal at this interface. When in the take-off position, the linkage elements supporting the assembly form a rigid, strong, truss-type load structure, thus requiring a lesser degree of torque to be imparted by an actuator associated with the airfoil to hold the leading edge assembly in the take-off position during take-off.

All radial loads are borne by the tapered roller bearing and transmitted to the bearing assembly housing (30).",TIMKEN CO,FOX GERALD P;;RHODES JOHN H,,https://lens.org/163-015-373-812-435,Granted Patent,no,0,0,12,12,0,F05B2240/50;;F05B2260/4031;;F16C19/497;;F16C19/543;;F16C25/083;;F16C33/60;;F16H57/021;;F16C2360/31;;F03D80/70;;F03D15/00;;F16C2361/61;;F03D15/10;;Y02E10/72;;F16H37/041;;F03D15/10;;F03D80/70;;F16C33/60;;F16H57/021;;F05B2240/50;;F16C19/497;;F16C25/083;;F16C19/543;;F05B2260/4031;;F16C2360/31;;F03D15/00;;F16C2361/61;;Y02E10/72,F16C19/49;;F03D11/00;;F03D11/02;;F16C19/54;;F16C35/077;;F16H57/02,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
