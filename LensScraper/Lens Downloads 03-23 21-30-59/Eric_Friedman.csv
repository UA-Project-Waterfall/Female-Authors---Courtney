The message may be encrypted. A client invokes the methods when a message is received from a sender that is not known to the client. A client can decrypt the message, break the message into chunks, and apply a differentially private algorithm to the set of chunks. The client transmits the differentially private message sketches to an aggregation server. The aggregation server receives a large collection of such message sketches for a large plurality of clients. The aggregation server returns aggregated message chunk (e.g. frequency) information to the client to assist the client in determining whether the message may be spam.

   A system is disclosed that provides a goal based learning system utilizing a rule based expert training system to provide a cognitive educational experience. The system provides the user with a simulated environment that presents a business opportunity to understand and solve optimally. Mistakes are noted and remedial educational material presented dynamically to build the necessary skills that a user requires for success in the business endeavor. The system utilizes an artificial intelligence engine driving individualized and dynamic feedback with synchronized video and graphics used to simulate real-world environment and interactions. Multiple correct answers are integrated into the learning system to allow individualized learning experiences in which navigation through the system is at a pace controlled by the learner. A robust business model provides support for realistic activities and allows a user to experience real world consequences for their actions and decisions and entails realtime decision-making and synthesis of the educational material. The system is architected around a table of components to manage and control the system.
