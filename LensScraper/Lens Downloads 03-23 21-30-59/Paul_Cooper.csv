The rate at which fuel is supplied by the booster pump assembly varies with variations in the demand for fuel by the engine. The booster pump assembly includes a pump having a small volumetric discharge capacity and a second pump having a large volumetric discharge capacity. An electric motor is provided to continuously drive the small pump. A fluid coupling is engaged to connect the large pump with the motor when the discharge pressure from the small pump decreases in response to an increase in demand for fuel by the engine. To engage the fluid coupling, a control assembly directs a flow of fuel to a space between input and output elements of the coupling. When the output pressure from the small pump increases due to a decrease in demand for fuel by the engine, the fluid coupling is drained to disconnect the large pump from the motor. To promote draining of the coupling, the space between the input and output elements of the coupling is vented to tank ullage by the control assembly.",TRW INC,COOPER PAUL,,https://lens.org/020-447-300-473-536,Granted Patent,yes,9,58,1,1,0,F02M37/18;;F02M37/18;;F02M37/04;;F02M37/04,F02M37/04;;F02M37/18,417/15,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   Disclosed are couplings for use in devices positioned in a molten metal bath. One is a rigid coupling that may include a counterweight, the coupling to reduce nonconcentric movements during rotation of a shaft, particularly a rotor shaft. Another coupling uses magnetic force, rather than a direct physical connection, to form a driving connection between a drive shaft (such as a motor drive shaft) and a driven shaft (such as a rotor shaft). In the event the rotor is jammed, the increased torque creates an overload that disconnects the drive shaft from the driven shaft in order to help prevent damage to the rotor, driven shaft, drive shaft and other components. Also disclosed is a coupling to transfer gas into a shaft, the coupling having a non-threaded internal surface to help prevent gas leakage and thus assist in preventing any resulting damage to the coupling and shaft.

The system includes at least a vessel for containing molten metal, an overflow (or dividing) wall, and a device or structure, such as a molten metal pump, for generating a stream of molten metal. The dividing wall divides the vessel into a first chamber and a second chamber, wherein part of the second chamber has a height H 2 . The device for generating a stream of molten metal, which is preferably a molten metal pump, is preferably positioned in the first chamber.

A gas-release opening is positioned so that it can release gas into one or more of the first section or the second section. As the molten metal moves from the first cross-sectional area to the second cross-sectional area gas is released into the molten metal and the molten metal flow helps to draw the gas into the flow, thereby lowering the pressure required to release gas into the molten metal.

A rotor is retained within the chamber and is connected to a rotor shaft. The device further includes a superstructure attached to and positioned above the pump housing, a motor on the superstructure, a drive shaft connected to the motor and a coupling connecting the drive shaft to the rotor shaft. The rotor extends beyond the input port to deflect solid particles thereby reducing jams and preferably is a dual-flow rotor, directing molten metal both into the chamber and out through the discharge. The coupling is flexible and has two coupling members with a flexible disc disposed therebetween. Another aspect of the invention is a housing for a transfer pump that includes a discharge leading to an output port and a button adaptor extending from the discharge. The button is dimensioned so that it can connect to a metal transfer conduit without the use of cement thereby reducing maintenance costs and downtime. Further, the vertical members such as the support posts, metal transfer conduit and rotor shaft, may be sectional so that anti-corrosive materials may be used for the sections positioned in the most corrosive areas of the molten metal furnace.

   Disclosed are components covered with a protective coating for use in a molten metal bath (or comparable environment) and devices including such components. The protective coating is preferably a ceramic sleeve adhered to a non-coated component by cement. A component with the protective coating is more resistant to degradation in molten metal than is the component without the coating, and may be manufactured by the process of (a) placing the protective coating over the non-coated component, and (b) injecting cement into the space between the non-coated component and protective coating, wherein at least some of the cement is injected through a passage in either the non-coated component or the protective coating.

The discharge has a first section including a first cross-sectional area and a second section including a second cross-sectional area, wherein the first section is upstream of the second section and the first cross-sectional area is smaller than the second cross-sectional area. A gas-release opening is positioned so that it can release gas into one or more of the first section or the second section. As the molten metal moves from the first cross-sectional area to the second cross-sectional area gas is released into the molten metal and the molten metal flow helps to draw the gas into the flow, thereby lowering the pressure required to release gas into the molten metal.

A rotor is retained within the chamber and is connected to a rotor shaft. The device further includes a superstructure attached to and positioned above the pump housing, a motor on the superstructure, a drive shaft connected to the motor and a coupling connecting the drive shaft to the rotor shaft. The rotor extends beyond the input port to deflect solid particles thereby reducing jams and preferably is a dual-flow rotor, directing molten metal both into the chamber and out through the discharge. The coupling is flexible and has two coupling members with a flexible disc disposed therebetween. Another aspect of the invention is a housing for a transfer pump that includes a discharge leading to an output port and a button adaptor extending from the discharge. The button is dimensioned so that it can connect to a metal transfer conduit without the use of cement thereby reducing maintenance costs and downtime. Further, the vertical members such as the support posts, metal transfer conduit and rotor shaft, may be sectional so that anti-corrosive materials may be used for the sections positioned in the most corrosive areas of the molten metal furnace.

When gas is transferred through the gas-transfer passage, it exits through the gas-release opening(s) in the bottom of the impeller. At least some of the gas enters the cavities where it is mixed with the molten metal being displaced by the impeller. Also disclosed are impellers that can be used to practice the invention.",COOPER PAUL V;;MOLTEN METAL EQUIPMENT INNOVATIONS LLC,COOPER PAUL V,MOLTEN METAL EQUIPMENT INNOVATIONS LLC (2016-02-22),https://lens.org/118-937-921-993-505,Granted Patent,yes,100,51,6,21,0,C22B9/05;;C22B9/05;;C21C1/06;;C21C1/06;;F01D5/147;;F27D3/16;;F27D3/16;;F27D27/00;;F27D27/00,F27D3/00;;C21C1/06;;C22B9/05;;F01D5/14;;F27D3/16;;F27D27/00,,99,0,,,"USPTO; Notice of Reissue Examination Certificate dated Aug. 27, 2001 in U.S. Appl.

The system includes a pump and a refractory casing that houses the pump. As the pump operates it moves molten metal upward through an uptake section of the casing until it reaches an outlet wherein it exits the vessel. The outlet may be attached to a launder. Another system uses a wall to divide a cavity of the chamber into two portions. The wall has an opening and a pump pumps molten metal from a first portion into a second portion until the level in the second portion reaches an outlet and exits the vessel.,COOPER PAUL V;;MOLTEN METAL EQUIPMENT INNOVATIONS LLC,COOPER PAUL V,MOLTEN METAL EQUIPMENT INNOVATIONS LLC (2016-02-22),https://lens.org/188-079-319-020-779,Granted Patent,yes,105,51,11,73,0,B22D7/00;;B22D7/00;;B22D37/00;;B22D37/00;;B22D39/00;;B22D39/00;;B22D41/00;;B22D41/00;;C22B21/0084;;C22B21/0084;;C22B21/064;;C22B21/064;;F27D3/14;;F27D3/14;;F27D3/0024;;F27D3/0024;;F27D27/005;;F27D27/005,F27D3/14;;B22D7/00;;B22D37/00;;B22D39/00;;B22D41/00;;C22B21/00;;C22B21/06;;F27D3/00;;F27D27/00,,99,0,,,"US 5,961,265, 10/1999, Meneice et al.

The system includes at least a vessel for containing molten metal, an overflow (or dividing) wall, and a device or structure, such as a molten metal pump, for generating a stream of molten metal. The dividing wall divides the vessel into a first chamber and a second chamber, wherein part of the second chamber has a height H 2 . The device for generating a stream of molten metal, which is preferably a molten metal pump, is preferably positioned in the first chamber. When the device operates, it generates a stream of molten metal from the first chamber and into the second chamber.

The pump creates a flow or stream of molten metal through the outlet port. One or more gas-release tubes are provided adjacent the outlet port, each gas-release tube having one or more gasrelease openings adjacent the outlet port. Gas is introduced into the gas-release tube(s) whereby it escapes through the openings into the molten metal stream thereby removing impurities from the molten metal. The system may further comprise a gasrelease block, having one or more openings, mounted adjacent the bottom of the outlet port, partially within the molten metal flow. Gas is introduced into the block through a gas-transfer device where the gas escapes through the openings and enters the lower portion of the molten metal stream. Finally, the system may further comprise a metal-transfer device for containing the molten metal stream.

    A molten metal pumping device is disclosed that comprises a pump base including at least one input port, a pump chamber, and a discharge leading to an output port. A rotor is retained within the chamber and is connected to a rotor shaft. The device further includes a superstructure attached to and positioned above the pump housing, a motor on the superstructure, a drive shaft connected to the motor and a coupling connecting the drive shaft to the rotor shaft. The rotor extends beyond the input port to deflect solid particles thereby reducing jams and preferably is a dual-flow rotor, directing molten metal both into the chamber and out through the discharge. The coupling is flexible and has two coupling members with a flexible disc disposed therebetween. Another aspect of the invention is a housing for a transfer pump that includes a discharge leading to an output port and a button adaptor extending from the discharge. The button is dimensioned so that it can connect to a metal transfer conduit without the use of cement thereby reducing maintenance costs and downtime. Further, the vertical members such as the support posts, metal transfer conduit and rotor shaft, may be sectional so that anti-corrosive materials may be used for the sections positioned in the most corrosive areas of the molten metal furnace. Additionally, a stationary component of the device may be configured to retain a thermocouple.

The system includes a microprocessor, a memory, and a peripheral device interconnected by the eight-bit data bus, the sixteen-bit address bus and a read-write conductor. The peripheral device includes an address code recognition circuit coupled to the data bus and one of the address lines, and also includes a fifteen-bit buffer connected to fifteen lines of the address bus. The address code recognition circuit generates an output which is gated with the read-write conductor to generate a clock signal which enables the data on the address bus to be loaded into the fifteen-bit buffer, from which it may be utilized by the peripheral device. During two microprocessor read cycles, two eight-bit bytes of data are loaded from the memory into the microprocessor via the data bus. Fifteen of these sixteen bits constitute data to be rapidly transferred to the peripheral device, and one bit is programmed as an enable bit to be inputted to the address code recognition circuit. During another microprocessor read cycle, another eight-bit byte including a peripheral address code is loaded from the memory into the microprocessor via the data bus. During a first portion of a microprocessor write cycle, the fifteen bits of data to be transferred to the peripheral device and the enable bit are outputted on the address bus. During a second portion of the same write cycle, the peripheral address code is out-putted on the data bus. If the enable bit is programmed to be a ""1"", and the peripheral address code is the one that the address code recognition circuit is set up to recognize, the code recognition circuit generates an enable signal which in turn is ANDed with a write pulse from the read-write conductor to produce a clock enable signal which enables the fifteen bits of data to be loaded into the fifteen-bit buffer. The fifteen bits of data are then available for utilization by the peripheral device.",NCR CO,COOPER PAUL J,,https://lens.org/170-938-800-038-106,Granted Patent,yes,2,80,1,1,0,G06F13/4217;;G06F15/7864;;G06F15/7864;;G06F13/4217,G06F13/42;;G06F15/78,364/200,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A pump is disclosed, including a motor and a pump housing, for pumping mixed gas and liquid. The pump includes two intermeshed screw members for providing progressive cavities for transporting mixed fluids, within a pumping cavity, from a suction passage to a discharge reservoir of the pump housing. It further uses pumped product to provide cooling and lubrication to the motor and to bearings and timing gears of the screw members. By using pumped product for lubrication and cooling, the need for seals is eliminated, thereby reducing the need for maintenance. This makes the pump package advantageous for subsea deployment for use in pumping nearly depleted wells which may be manifolded together to provide adequate product flow.

June 27, 1968, No. 30787/68. Heading F1T. Stator blades 20 for the compressor of a gas turbine vertical lift engine, or other fluid-flow machine, are rigidly mounted on a hub member 21 at their inner ends and at their outer ends 22 are retained in apertures 23 in a casing 11 by means of elastomeric material 24 which allows for differential thermal expansion between the casing and blades. The elastomeric material 24 may be a synthetic polymer or co-polymer, e. g. polyurethane or polyacrylonitrile, which is introduced by positioning the blades 20 in the apertures 23 and then pouring in or moulding the material.

The satellite phone forms a highly directed beam toward a satellite of the communications system and adaptively maintains a beam to track the satellite as the satellite phone and/or the satellite moves relative to each other. The satellite phone contains sensors which provide steering information for directing the satellite phone's antenna beam. The communication system links a satellite phone with either another satellite phone and/or a ground based communication system connected to conventional telephone stations. The satellite phone also includes a database that contains the positional information of all potential communication satellites. The communication system coordinates satellite phone beams with a satellite network to facilitate high quality handoffs. Satellite phones can access several satellite networks based upon stored parameters or actively downloaded satellite information.,AT & T CORP,BRADLEY JAMES FREDERICK;;COOPER PAUL W,RAKUTEN INC (2012-07-19);;AT&T CORP (1997-03-12);;AT&T PROPERTIES LLC (2012-05-29);;AT&T INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY II L.P (2012-05-29),https://lens.org/162-093-678-942-406,Granted Patent,yes,10,83,3,3,0,H04B7/18571;;H04B7/18571,G01S19/35;;H04B7/185,342/357,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

At the vent, flaps 4 of the curtain on either side of the vent have marginal overlaps 5. To these are stitched elevated temperature resistant hook and loop fastening tapes 6. These normally keep the vent closed. The curtain is provided with a bottom bar 16 drawn up to close the head box when the curtain is not deployed. When the curtain is deployed, the bottom bar rests on the floor 17. Ceiling-to-floor guides 21 are provided on walls 22 at the edges of the aperture 23 to be closed by the curtain when deployed. These have in-turned lips 24 between which the edges 25 of the curtain extend. Retention elements, in the form of small rolling element bearings 26 are attached intermittently along the edges. They hold the edges of the deployed curtain into the guides. The combined effect of the these edge arrangements and the stiffening battens 7 is to keep the curtain flat when deployed. The bottom bar 16 has a head box closure plate 31, extending rigidly across the width of the aperture between the guides 21. The curtain is connected to bottom bar members 33 associated with the closure plate, but free to move with respect to it, at least centrally of the closure plate. At the edges of the curtain, the edges 25 are connected to both the closure plate and the bar members. The result is that the bottom bar members are pivotally attached to the bottom of the guides 21 (when the curtain is deployed). The pivotable members 33 extend in along the bottom of the curtain as far as the vent, where they have chamfered overlaps 34, complementary to the curtain overlaps 5. One of the pivotable members has a slot 35 and the other has a tongue 36, engageable in the slot. The tongue and the slot have complementary magnets (not shown) where by the tongue is normally held in the slot. Thus the bottom bar members form a separable continuous member, which holds the bottom of the curtain steady as if it were connected to the closure plate 31.

At the vent, flaps 4 of the curtain on either side of the vent have marginal overlaps 5. To these are stitched elevated temperature resistant hook and loop fastening tapes 6. These normally keep the vent closed. The curtain is provided with a bottom bar 16 drawn up to close the head box when the curtain is not deployed. When the curtain is deployed, the bottom bar rests on the floor 17. Ceiling-to-floor guides 21 are provided on walls 22 at the edges of the aperture 23 to be closed by the curtain when deployed. These have in-turned lips 24 between which the edges 25 of the curtain extend. Retention elements, in the form of small rolling element bearings 26 are attached intermittently along the edges. They hold the edges of the deployed curtain into the guides. The combined effect of the these edge arrangements and the stiffening battens 7 is to keep the curtain flat when deployed. The bottom bar 16 has a head box closure plate 31, extending rigidly across the width of the aperture between the guides 21. The curtain is connected to bottom bar members 33 associated with the closure plate, but free to move with respect to it, at least centrally of the closure plate. At the edges of the curtain, the edges 25 are connected to both the closure plate and the bar members. The result is that the bottom bar members are pivotally attached to the bottom of the guides 21 (when the curtain is deployed). The pivotable members 33 extend in along the bottom of the curtain as far as the vent, where they have chamfered overlaps 34, complementary to the curtain overlaps 5. One of the pivotable members has a slot 35 and the other has a tongue 36, engageable in the slot. The tongue and the slot have complementary magnets (not shown) where by the tongue is normally held in the slot.

    Latent effects on a system are broken down into components ranging from those far removed in time from the system under study (latent) to those which closely effect changes in the system. Each component is provided with weighted inputs either by a user or from outputs of other components. A non-linear mathematical process known as soft aggregation is performed on the inputs to each component to provide information relating to the component. This information is combined in decreasing order of latency to the system to provide a quantifiable measure of an attribute of a system (e.g., safety) or to test hypotheses (e.g., for forensic deduction or decisions about various system design options).

Fig. 1 shows a layer 3 of partially vulcanized hard rubber strip 10 which has been coated with a bonding composition, the sides of the strip being castellated to interfit with adjacent turns or bands thereof. The layer may be pre-formed as a hoop laterally tied by a winding of fine metal wire, or the sides of the rubber strip may be serrated instead of castellated. Fig. 2 shows stranded steel cable windings 13 having flattened portions 14 for adjacent windings to interfit as shown.

The caching systems and methods of the present application utilize a series of small (in terms of disk capacity) Cache Farms, transparent caches or ""injectors"" in communication the ISP network border router. The injectors may be clustered together at network access points (NAP). Networks at these NAPs then use WCCP protocol on their routers, or Layer 4 switches, to redirect their traffic to these clusters of injectors or Cache Farm. This redirection occurs over a dedicated high speed ""cross connect"" from the network border router to the injector farm or Cache Farm. The network border router is programmed to handle OUTBOUND content requests for its end users, and INBOUND content requests for its content provider customers. For the content that is not located on the injector Cache Farm, the injector Cache Farm will communicate with a Central Cache to determine if the Central Cache has the requested content. There is at least about a seventy five (75 %) percent chance, according to the systems and methods of the present application that the requested content will be cached or stored on the Central Cache and thus the end user receives the requested content without use of a NAP or electronic traffic over an Internet backbone.",MIRROR IMAGE INTERNET INC,CHRISTEN PAUL H P;;COOPER IAN H,,https://lens.org/087-904-699-734-620,Patent Application,no,0,0,5,5,0,H04L67/1095;;H04L67/1021;;H04L67/289;;H04L69/329;;H04L67/10015;;H04L67/1001;;H04L67/563;;H04L67/568;;H04L67/63,G06F13/00;;G06F12/00;;H04L29/06;;H04L29/08,,0,0,,,,PENDING

   The ATSC standard for digital television broadcast specifies a data Channel in addition to the normal audio and video channels. A methodology is provided for using the ATSC data Channel to broadcast MPEG-4 video streams, for which a new video service is created. The MPEG-4 streams can be encapsulated into MPEG-2 PES (Packetized Elementary Streams) packets or directly into MPEG-2 transport packets. These mechanisms enable the synchronous broadcast of MPEG-4 streams for an ATSC digital TV system without a change to the ATSC standard when data casting. In a system for transmission of video and audio information, in which the system is constrained to operate pursuant to a given standard, including application of a given coding methodology, transmission of the information using a coding methodology that is independent of the coding methodology is provided through encoding the information into a plurality of increments encoded according to the independent coding methodology; and encapsulating the encoded information increments into a payload portion of transmission packets established according to the given standard.
