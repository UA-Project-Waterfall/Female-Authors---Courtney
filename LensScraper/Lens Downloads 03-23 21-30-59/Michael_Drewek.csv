    An electrical connector assembly using conventional signal pins is adapted for use with impedance-controlled cables by dividing the body of the connector into one or more separate channels. Each channel is defined by a perimeter providing electrical shielding. A separate impedance-controlled wire or cable can be terminated at conventional signal pins installed in an insert located within a particular channel. A transition region between a connector plug or receptacle and an incoming wire or cable preserves the correct impedance characteristics of the cable.
