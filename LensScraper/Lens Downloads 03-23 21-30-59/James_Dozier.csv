The method further includes measuring a vertical proportion, a vertical alignment, a horizontal proportion, and an alignment of the fused beam source using the first and second test articles (104, 302). The method includes determining whether one of a vertical proportion, a vertical alignment, a horizontal proportion, or a horizontal alignment of the fused beam source is not within a corresponding tolerance of the target specification. If at least one of the vertical proportion, the vertical alignment, the horizontal proportion, or the horizontal alignment is within a corresponding tolerance, the method includes adjusting a fused beam source of the AM system (100) to align the fused beam source to produce a target specification.",GEN ELECTRIC,PUCCIO JOHN BRIAN;;ROCHSON ROBERT J;;MILLER MICHAEL E;;MURRAY III JAMES JOSEPH;;HORTON MARGARET RUTH;;DOZIER EVAN JOHN;;GRIFFITH CHARLES T;;DURKIEWICZ CHRISTOPHER JOHN,,https://lens.org/019-046-003-226-915,Patent Application,no,0,0,4,4,0,B22F10/31;;B22F10/28;;B22F2999/00;;B33Y50/02;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y30/00;;B22F12/90;;B29C64/393;;B29C64/153;;B22F10/85;;B29C64/268;;Y02P10/25;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y30/00;;B33Y50/02;;B23K26/342;;B22F12/40;;B22F10/85;;B22F10/28;;B23K26/03;;B23K26/04;;G05B15/02,B22F12/44;;B22F12/90;;B33Y30/00;;B33Y50/02,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The method further has a step of measuring the vertical scale, vertical alignment, horizontal scale and horizontal alignment of molten beam sources 110, 112, 114, 116 using the first test article and the second test article. The method has a step of determining whether one of the vertical scale, the vertical alignment, the horizontal scale and the horizontal alignment of the molten beam sources lies within an allowable range corresponding to target specifications or not. The method has a step of adjusting the molten beam sources of an AM system so as to obtain the target specifications by executing alignment adjustment for the molten beam sources when at least one of the vertical scale, the vertical alignment, the horizontal scale and the horizontal alignment does not lie within the corresponding allowable range.SELECTED DRAWING: Figure 1",GENERAL ELECTRIC CO GE,JOHN BRYAN POURCHO;;ROBERT JOSEPH ROHRSSEN;;MAXWELL EVAN MILLER;;JAMES JOSEPH MURRAY III;;MICHAEL RYAN HORTON;;EVAN JOHN DOZIER;;CLAY THOMAS GRIFFIS;;CHAD JOSEPH DULKIEWICZ,,https://lens.org/151-396-543-009-108,Patent Application,no,0,0,4,4,0,B22F10/31;;B22F10/28;;B22F2999/00;;B33Y50/02;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y30/00;;B22F12/90;;B29C64/393;;B29C64/153;;B22F10/85;;B29C64/268;;Y02P10/25;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y30/00;;B33Y50/02;;B23K26/342;;B22F12/40;;B22F10/85;;B22F10/28;;B23K26/03;;B23K26/04;;G05B15/02,B22F10/366;;B22F10/25;;B22F10/28;;B22F10/85;;B29C64/153;;B29C64/393;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y50/02,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Vector elements are transmitted from memory, either main memory, a physical cache unit or a logical cache through a source bus where the elements are alternately loaded into the vector processing units. The vector control unit decodes the vector instructions and generates the required control commands for operating the registers and logical units within the vector processing units. Thus, the vector processing units essentially work in parallel to double the processing rate. The resulting vectors are transmitted through a destination bus to either the physical cache unit, the main memory, the logical cache or to an input/output processor. In a further aspect of the computer there is produced an entry microword from a store for the immediate execution of the first microinstruction within a sequence of microinstructions. The remaining microinstructions are produced from a conventional store. This reduces the delay in the retrieval and execution of the first microinstruction.
