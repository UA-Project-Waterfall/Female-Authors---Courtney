Time-delayed fastenings. G. Q. PARACHUTE CO. Ltd. April 27, 1962 [May 4, 1961], No. 16248/61. Heading E2A. A delayed release locking device comprises means at one end for attaching a load, means at the other end for attaching a supporting means for the load, locking means for holding an attachment, and a timing mechanism which is held immobilised until a predetermined strain developed between the two ends of the device trips the timing mechanism which after a delay has expired, releases the locking means to release the attachment. As shown, the device comprises a first housing 1 mounted for axial movement within a second housing 7. The first housing includes a part 2 carrying a swivel eye 3, a part 4 and an annular toothed union 5 securing the parts 2 and 4 together. The union 5 consists of a ring having a plurality of lugs 6 projecting coaxially therefrom. The housing 7 is formed by an annular sleeve 8 and a head 9 in which are pivoted, on a shaft 9, a pair of spring-loaded detent lugs 12, 13. The sleeve 8 is provided with apertures 18 complementary to the lugs 6. A rigging line ring 19 is secured in position on the head 9 by portions 20 of a sleeve 21 which is screwed on to the head. The lugs 12, 13 each extend through a square hole in a cap 24 closing a timing mechanism compartment, each lug being provided with a cut-away portion 25, which together constitute a square hole into which a square spigot 26 can be caused to extend. The spigot 26 is carried by a threaded shaft 28 which is driven from a spring loaded clockwork mechanism. A spring-loaded U- shaped element 39 extends through the cap 24 and a plate 38, the cross piece of the element 39 carrying an arm 44 which is engageable with one of four projections 45 provided on a gearwheel 36 of the mechanism. The swivel eye 3 includes a ball race 49 and an externally screwed and flanged tubular member 50. A key 52 extends through the member 50, the key having two parallel limbs 53, a guide slot 54 for a screw 55 and a screwed outer end 56, which is engaged by a nut 59. A nut 57 is engaged on the member 50 and the nut 57, swivel 3 and member 50 are locked together by a screw 58. A pin 60 extends through the member 50. In operation, for releasing loop tapes 64 of a drogue sock 63 which encloses a stabilizer parachute 62 the drag exerted on a person to which the device is attached causes movement between the housings 1 and 7 to depress the element 39 and thus free the gearwheel 36 to allow the clockwork mechanism to unwind, the spigot 26 to withdraw from the lugs 12, 13, which then move radially inwardly to disengage the cap 24 and free the housings 1 and 7 for relative axial movement so that the lugs 6 become clear of the tops of the apertures 18 whereby to free the tapes 64 and permit operation of the parachute 62. The device is reset to the condition shown in Fig. 1 by attaching the parachute and drogue sock, rotating screw 55 to withdraw its free end from the key 52, rotating the nut 59 to move the key 52 towards the clockwork mechanism until limbs 53 of the key are disposed on each side of a pin 48 and the pin 60. The mechanism can then be rewound by rotating the swivel eye 3 and nut 57 and moving the mechanism axially to depress the element 39. Continued rotation of the eye 3 rotates nut 29 to re-engage the spigot 26 with the lugs 12, 13 and the key is retracted by rotating nut 59.",GQ PARACHUTE COMP LTD,COOPER DANIEL WAUMSLEY,,https://lens.org/165-645-780-619-244,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,B64D17/58;;B64D17/58;;B64D1/02;;B64D1/02;;Y10T74/116;;Y10T74/116,B64D1/02;;B64D17/58,E2A ABJ           ABJ;;E2A A139          ABJ;;E2A A143          ABJ;;E2A A162          ABJ;;E2A A429          ABJ;;E2A A503          ABJ;;U1S S1143,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

PARACHUTE CO., Ltd. July 14, 1964 [Aug. 6, 1963], No. 30954/63. Heading E2A. A quick release device for holding a number of lugs, for example, lugs attached to a harness for a parachutist comprises a body 18, a control member 11 mounted on the body for rotary and axial movement thereto and a plate 20 integrally formed with spigots 22 on which the lugs are held, the lugs being retained on the spigots by spring-pressed members 24 carried by the body, the lugs being released from the spigots by movement of the plate away from the lugs. In the construction shown the body is screwed to a back plate 12 which also has a slot to receive a harness strap and the body is surrounded by a base ring 13 which is also attached to the plate 12. The control member 11 which forms a cover for the body carries a screw 16 which mates with a threaded bore in the spigot plate 20 so that the control member can be rotated relative to the spigot plate 20. The spigot plate has four spigots 22 which are chamfered towards the outer edges to assist in the insertion of the harness lugs. Holes 40 are provided in the spigot plate to accommodate pillars 39 which are screwed into the back plate 12 and the pillars prevent rotation of the spigot plate and also prevent the lugs being held by the spigots 22 during the release operation. The spigot plate is retained in the body by plungers 17 which are loaded by springs 27. The body contains two plungers 21 which are pressed by springs 19 towards the control member 11 and each of which has balls 41 at their outer ends to reduce friction as the control member is rotated and which enter depressions to limit rotation of the control member. The members 24 are hinged in the body about hinge pins 25 and are pressed towards the spigot plate 20 by springs 24. The control member has a central spigot 42 which carries a cam 33 and a pin 34, and a spring 26 presses the cam 33 against the pin 34. The cam has two side tongues which ride in slots in a portion not shown which projects from the back plate; the coaction of the pin and the cam prevents accidental movement of the control member 11. The back plate also carries stops 37 which slide in a well 45 and are held apart by a spring 28. These stops carry L-shaped projections 46, the upper faces of which normally lie under the spigot plate 20 to prevent its depression; rotation of the control member 11 from its normal position however through 90 degrees causes the lower part of the screw 16 to engage cam surfaces on the stops 37 to press the stops together sufficiently to allow the spigot plate to be pressed down over the projections 46; this lowers the spigot plate relative to the members 24 and produces gaps through which the harness lugs can be withdrawn. During the downward movement of the spigot plate the top surfaces of the pillars 39 engage the harness lugs and holds the lugs so that the downward movement of the plate disengages the spigots from-the lugs. The lugs can only be engaged with the spigots when the control member is in its normal non-rotated position and this is accomplished by pivoting the members 24 against the bias of their springs. In any other position of the control member movement of the members 24 is prevented by their engagement with the plungers 21 which have an upward movement as the control member is turned. The construction shown has four spigots each of which accommodates one lug but in a modification there are three spigots one of which can accommodate two lugs; in this case the recess around the spigot in the plate 20 is deeper and the pillar 39 is provided with a spring loaded portion to assist the release of the lugs. The control member is provided with four thumb depressions which form a grip for turning the member and the disposition of which indicates to the wearer whether the control member is in the normal ""locking"" position or in the position 90 degrees rotated from this position, i.e. the ""releasing"" position. A visual indicator can also be fitted in the side of the control member which shows one colour at the top of the control member for one position of rotation and another colour for the other position.",GQ PARACHUTE COMP LTD,COOPER DANIEL WAUMSLEY,,https://lens.org/046-932-688-183-326,Granted Patent,no,0,8,1,1,0,B64D17/32,B64D17/32,E2A AAK           AAK/B;;E2A AB2B          -;;E2A AC8D          -;;E2A AC8F          -;;E2A AD5C2U        -;;E2A A100          AAK/B;;E2A A106          AAK/B;;E2A A120          AAK/B;;E2A A160          AAK/B;;E2A A184          AAK/B;;E2A A429          AAK/B,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

PARACHUTE CO. Ltd. Feb. 27, 1961 [March 9, 1960], No. 8286/60. Class 44. A quick-release device for parachute or similar safety harness includes a control member 10 operatively connected to a plurality of spring-loaded plungers 88, part of the control member being housed within a box or casing 10, each of the spring-loaded plungers being engageable with a hole in a lug on the end of one of the harness straps and the arrangement being such that when the lugs are pushed into the box or casing, they cause the plungers to move axially by overriding their bevelled ends, the plungers returning by spring force to their original position to engage the holes in the lugs which are thus retained in position and when one or more of the lugs is so engaged disengagement of the plunger or plungers from the lug or lugs is achieved by rotating the control member relatively to the box or casing from a loading position on which its axial movement is prevented, to a discharge position in which such axial movement may take place, in which discharge position it may be moved axially to a release position, its operative connection with the spring-loaded plungers being such that this axial movement causes axial movement of the spring-loaded plungers so that the harness lugs are released, self-locking safety means being provided for locking the plungers to positively prevent axial movement thereof relative to the control member after the harness lugs have been loaded and which ensure that the lugs can only be loaded when the control member is in the loading position in which axial movement relative to the box or casing is prevented. As shown, a sleeve 80 surrounds each of the plungers, a catch 94 carried by each of the plungers and forming one of the safety locking means being engageable with the sleeve and each being engaged by a spider 52 which is connected to the control member 60. Each of the plungers is biased by a spring 156 and this spring also engages the catch 94 to urge it into engagement with the sleeve. The spider 52 has four arms, each of which is formed with bifurcated ends and these engage slots in the sleeves 80 so that when the spider is moved axially the sleeves must also move. The plungers are each provided with cut-away portions in register with the slots so that the plungers can move independently of the sleeves. The control member 60 is connected to the spider so that it can rotate with respect to the spider but so that it moves the spider when it is moved axially. The control member is rigidly connected to a cover 142 by which it is operated and it has a cavity 70 formed within it which consists of two series of conjoined cam faces which are arranged horizontally and the ends of which are connected together by verticallydisposed channels each of which has a step. A cam follower 74, not shown, is disposed horizontally in the box or casing and is urged by a spring into the cavity to engage the cam faces. Also mounted in the box or casing is a locking device 104 constituting another of the safety means which can lock the control member against rotation by engaging a notch 64 in a flange 58. The locking device is biased by a spring 110. A spring-loaded plunger 128 is provided in the body which co-operates with a lug 148 on the cover 142 to prevent the cover and hence the control member being depressed in the locking position of the control member; the plunger 128 and lug 148 form another of the safety means. When the control member is in the locking position so that the lugs on the harness can be pushed into the box or casing, each lug first comes into contact with the catch 94 moving it to a position in which a projecting portion 100 thereof is clear of the sleeve 80; further movement of the lug into the box or casing pushes the plunger 88 downwardly relative to the sleeve until a hole in the lug is in register with the plunger 88 when the spring 156 urges the plunger upwardly to lock the lug to the box or casing. When the lug is engaged in this manner the catch 94 moves radially outwardly under the influence of the spring 156 and latches over the sleeve 80. In this position gravitational forces cannot cause the plungers to release the lugs since the plungers are locked to the sleeves and the sleeves are restrained from movement by the spider which because of its connection with the control member cannot move. The control member is prevented from axial movement by engagement of the cam-follower 74 with one of the steps in a vertical channel of the control member and also by engagement of the lug 148 on the cover with the plunger 128. Before the lugs are inserted into the box or casing the control member is locked against rotation by the device 104, a spigot 108 of which is in engagement with the notch 64 in the flange of the control member; when the lug is inserted into the box or casing however, its leading end comes into contact with a bevelled face 168 of the device 104 and moves the device upwardly so freeing the spigot from the notch and releasing the control member for rotation when necessary. When the lugs are to be released the cover 142 is turned through approximately 90 degrees, this causes the lug 148 to move clear of the plunger 128 and also because of the rotation of the control member 60 causes the cam-follower 74 to move along the lower series of cam faces from the cam face 116 to the cam face 170; the cover 142 can then be pressed downwardly and this moves the spider 52 downwardly. The spider takes the sleeves with it and since the plungers 88 are locked to the sleeves they also move downwardly to release the lugs. The cam follower moves along one of the vertically-disposed channels into contact with cam face 172 and because of the step in this channel between the cam face 170 and the cam face 172 the control member, plungers and sleeves will remain in the release position. To reset the device to its locking condition the cover 142 is rotated through 90 degrees in the opposite direction to the first-mentioned rotation; when the cover and control member have regained their original positions the cam follower 74 is aligned with the other vertical channel and the springs 156 cause the plungers, sleeves, spider, control member and cover to move upwardly to the locking position. In its rotation the lug 148 comes into contact with the plunger 128 but since the face of the plunger is bevelled the lug causes it to retract, the plunger regaining its normal position when the cover rises vertically.",GQ PARACHUTE COMP LTD,COOPER DANIEL WAUMSLEY,,https://lens.org/054-423-618-209-935,Granted Patent,no,0,1,3,3,0,B64D17/32;;B64D17/32;;Y10T24/45618;;Y10T24/45618,B64D17/32,E2A AAK           AAK/B;;E2A ACAK          ACAK/B;;E2A A100          AAK/B;;E2A A100          ACAK/B;;E2A A101          AAK/B;;E2A A104          AAK/B;;E2A A106          AAK/B;;E2A A106          ACAK/B;;E2A A118          AAK/B;;E2A A118          ACAK/B;;E2A A142          AAK/B;;E2A A160          AAK/B;;E2A A160          ACAK/B;;E2A A162          AAK/B;;E2A A171          AAK/B;;E2A A184          AAK/B;;E2A A184          ACAK/B;;E2A A400          ACAK/B;;E2A A426          ACAK/B;;E2A A427          ACAK/B;;E2A A429          AAK/B;;E2A A429          ACAK/B;;E2A A508          AAK/B;;E2A A510          ACAK/B;;U1S S1142;;U1S S1143;;U1S S1575,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Press studs, controlled fastenings; studs and sockets. G. Q. PARACHUTE CO. Ltd. July 8, 1964 [July 17, 1963], No. 28231/63. Headings E2A and E2B. [Also in Divisions B7 and F2] A release mechanism for a parachute pack comprises an operating device, fastening devices on the parachute pack and a transmission means connecting the operating device with the fastening devices, the operating device being connected to the transmission means through a pulley system so arranged that during the initial movement of the operating device, the operating device moves faster than the'transmission means. In the construction shown the operating device is a handle 11 and the pulley system comprises a casing 22 carrying a carriage 23 (not shown) in which a pulley 17 is freely rotatable and a wire 18 connecting the carriage to the handle. The carriage is freely slidable in the housing and the wire 18 passes round the pulley 17 and the ends of the wire are connected to the handle and to the casing 22 by means of balls 15 and 16 connected to the ends of the wire. The ball 16 is held in a slot in the casing 22 by a breaking tie across the slot. The arrangement provides a mechanical advantage for moving wires 12 and 13 which are connected to the carriage by means of balls 24 and 25 at one end of each and the other end of each being connected to pins 33 which are part of the fastening devices of the parachute pack.

Ultrasound echoes from heart structures are plotted in the image spaces by means of special x, y sweeps which are offset to the image spaces by timing circuitry. Separate delay and spacing counters allow the first image to be stored at one interval after detection of the ECG R-wave and successive images to be stored at a another uniform interval. An ECG trace is stored in the first image space with cursors indicating the selected image timing. The scan converter is read out to a TV display. During image build-up, the read and write modes alternate. If desired, the TV sweeps to the scan converter may be attenuated and offset to display a single stored image. Images displayed in sequence provide animation. A self test circuit substitutes a fake ECG and writes bars in the scan converter image spaces using TV sweeps for the scan sweeps. The timing circuitry for the normal images gates the video for the bars. All of the timing for the system is derived from a TV composite sync signal and the patient's ECG current.",DICK DONALD E;;COOPER DANIEL;;HILEMAN RONALD E,DICK DONALD E;;COOPER DANIEL;;HILEMAN RONALD E,TECHNICARE CORPORATION (1980-09-29),https://lens.org/028-304-285-201-737,Granted Patent,yes,4,164,1,1,0,A61B8/14;;A61B8/543;;A61B5/319;;A61B5/352;;A61B8/543;;A61B8/14;;A61B5/319;;A61B5/352,A61B5/352;;A61B8/14,128  205 Z,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Demodulated chrominance or peak detected chrominance from a video signal output by a video system in response to a video test signal is input to the recursive noise reduction filter (24) which acts as a comb filter to suppress noise significantly at frequencies other than harmonics of the horizontal line rate. The signal is scaled by a first attenuator (30) having a scaling factor of (1-a), where (a) is less than one, and input to a summing circuit (32). Also input to the summing circuit is a delayed signal from a prior horizontal line scaled by the scaling factor (a). The output of the summing circuit is a filtered output signal. The signal is sampled only during horizontal lines that have the video test signal and is stored for subsequent accumulation with other horizontal lines also having the video test signal. The filter serves to add the vertically correlated part of the signal corresponding to the video test signal while averaging out the noise, thus improving the overall signal to noise ratio without degrading the signal spectrum and, hence, enhancing differential gain and phase measurements.

A computer has a central processing unit, a peripheral processing unit containing a plurality of virtual processors coupled to a common arithmetic unit, several memory units including magnetic tape, disc and thin film, a card reader and punch, a line printer, cathode ray tubes and keyboards. The CPU 10 executes user programs which require input/output services from the PPU 11. Programs which can proceed without waiting for an I/O service to be provided request a system call and proceed SCP command on line 41 and the program continues. Programs which cannot proceed without the service wait and a new program is selected. The PPU constantly analyses the programs in CPU 10 not being executed and chooses which is to be executed next and sets a switch plug 44. When a SCW command appears from the CPU on line 42 the switch plug enables an AND gate 43 which resets the plug and causes an indication of the next program to be executed to be fed to the CPU. This enables the next program to be executed without delay caused by a dialogue between the CPU and the PPU. The computer opsrates on vectors (X 1 , X 2 ... X n ) and is arranged to multiply matrices where To produce the matrix C two program loops are followed, an inner loop to produce rows e.g. C 11 ,C 12 ,C 13 and an outer loop changing the indices to allow the inner loop to produce the next row. The computer communicates at high speed with the arithmetic unit and is capable of looking at four succeeding operations at the same time (Fig. 7) so that as the arithmetic unit is performing a calculation T 1 Store/Fetch and Control Units are preparing for the next operation T 2 , the index and instruction buffer units prepare for the following operation T 3 and the instruction Fetch Unit is obtaining the next instruction. Data to the AU is passed via buffers A<SP>1</SP>, A and B<SP>1</SP>, B and is returned via buffers C<SP>1</SP>, C a word being supplied per clock pulse and an arithmetical operation being performed in general during a clock pulse. A generic vector instruction acquired in Unit 128 transfers data from a vector parameter file 125 to file 132 so that complex vector operations are specified at the machine language level. The file 132, used for multiplying vectors A and B to produce C, defines the starting addresses in store of the three vectors, the number of elements in the operation, the number of turns in each loop and the address increments for each loop and the file works in conjunction with file 133 holding the current address of the vectors and the vector and loop counts. The arithmetic unit is pipe-lined and has several units performing different jobs and capable of being cross coupled in different ways. The virtual processors are selected by means of the unit shown in Fig. 13. As described, 8 virtual processors are used and two registers between them holding as many four bit words as there are time sharing slots in a timing cycle are provided, each four bit word feeding a set of four AND gates, which sets are successively enabled by a counter 418 fed with clock pulses. Each AND gate of a set feeds a separate OR gate 450-453 which feeds a register coupled to a decoder 455. Each four bit word contains 3 bits identifying one of the eight processors and one bit enabling or inhibiting the decoder. The decoder supplies a signal coupling one of the processors and the arithmetic unit together. The registers allow any desired allocation of time to any processors and allows easy change of the allocation.",TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INC,KASTNER WILLIAM DANIEL;;WATSON WILLIAM JOSEPH;;COOPER THOMAS EDWARD,,https://lens.org/146-059-249-110-59X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,8,8,0,G06F15/8076;;G06F15/8076,G06F9/46;;G06F15/78;;G06F17/00;;G06F17/16,G4A AMV           MV;;G4A APP           PP;;G4A A16D          A;;G4A A16D          G;;G4A A16D          MV;;G4A A16D          PP;;G4A A16G          A;;G4A A16G          G;;G4A A16G          MV;;G4A A16G          PP;;G4A A16H          A;;G4A A16H          G;;G4A A16H          MV;;G4A A16H          PP;;G4A A16J          A;;G4A A16J          G;;G4A A16J          MV;;G4A A16J          PP;;G4A A17B4         A;;G4A A17B4         G;;G4A A17B4         MV;;G4A A17B4         PP;;G4A A2F5          A;;G4A A2F5          G;;G4A A2F5          MV;;G4A A2F5          PP;;G4A A5B           A;;G4A A5B           G;;G4A A5B           MV;;G4A A5B           PP;;G4A A6G           A;;G4A A6G           G;;G4A A6G           MV;;G4A A6G           PP;;G4A A6H           A;;G4A A6H           G;;G4A A6H           MV;;G4A A6H           PP;;G4A A9C           A;;G4A A9C           G;;G4A A9C           MV;;G4A A9C           PP;;G4A A9D           A;;G4A A9D           G;;G4A A9D           MV;;G4A A9D           PP;;G4A A9X           A;;G4A A9X           G;;G4A A9X           MV;;G4A A9X           PP,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A recycle stream is used to increase the conversion potential by reducing the relative mercaptan concentration of the untreated gasoline. Part of the treated gasoline effluent is recycled to the untreated feed. The treated gasoline has a low mercaptan concentration while the untreated gasoline is high in mercaptans. As the two streams combine, the feed to the unit becomes less concentrated in mercaptan compounds. In effect, the mercaptan concentration of the untreated gasoline has been diluted by the treated gasoline. Nitrogen inhibits the solubility of oxygen into gasoline. Nitrogen present in the recycle stream would create a system high in nitrogen and low in oxygen. By increasing the level of nitrogen, oxygen is limited in its ability to complete the sweetening reaction. In order to keep nitrogen from inhibiting oxygen, the gasoline effluent is sent to a low pressure separation vessel. in this vessel, nitrogen gas separates from the liquid gasoline. Part of this liquid gasoline stream is recycled to join with the untreated gasoline.

In particular, the invention provides new methods for classifying cancers to make a determination of risk of cancer progression (for example in early cancer), to identify patient populations that may be susceptible to particular treatments and to present opportunities (for example to provide tailored treatment regimens), or to identify patient populations that do not require treatment. The methods of the invention may include identifying potentially aggressive cancers to determine which cancers are or will become aggressive (and hence require treatment) and which will remain indolent (and will therefore not require treatment).

Classification is achieved using a novel analysis method that uses less computing power than methods of the prior art. In particular, the invention provides new methods for classifying cancers to make a determination of risk of cancer progression (for example in early cancer), to identify patient populations that may be susceptible to particular treatments and to present opportunities (for example to provide tailored treatment regimens), or to identify patient populations that do not require treatment. The methods of the invention may include identifying potentially aggressive cancers to determine which cancers are or will become aggressive (and hence require treatment) and which will remain indolent (and will therefore not require treatment). The present invention is therefore useful to identify a patient's prognosis and identify those with good or poor prognoses.

Classification is achieved using a novel analysis method that uses less computing power than methods of the prior art. In particular, the invention provides new methods for classifying cancers to make a determination of risk of cancer progression (for example in early cancer), to identify patient populations that may be susceptible to particular treatments and to present opportunities (for example to provide tailored treatment regimens), or to identify patient populations that do not require treatment. The methods of the invention may include identifying potentially aggressive cancers to determine which cancers are or will become aggressive (and hence require treatment) and which will remain indolent (and will therefore not require treatment). The present invention is therefore useful to identify a patient's prognosis and identify those with good or poor prognoses.

   A low voltage optical phase modulator includes a splitter having an input, a first output, and a second output. The input receives an optical signal and is split between the first and second outputs. A phase adjustment element is coupled to the second output and produces a predetermined optical shift in the optical signal to produce a phase-shifted optical signal. A first electroabsorptive element is coupled to the first output and blocks transmission of the optical signal when the first electroabsorptive element is activated with a low voltage. A second electroabsorptive element is coupled to the phase adjustment element and blocks transmission of the phase-shifted optical signal when the second electroabsorptive element is activated using the low voltage. An optical combiner having a first combiner input, a second combiner input, and a combiner output is coupled to the first and second electroabsorptive elements and receives the optical signal and the phase-shifted optical signal. The combiner combines these optical signals to produce a binary encoded optical signal. The present invention thus achieves an improved low voltage optical phase modulator. The present invention is advantageous in that substantially larger than 180 degrees phase shift can be achieved with the same low voltage by using optical paths having longer lengths.

The stabilized mixtures retain the capacity for being milled to form sheets for long periods. Pre ferred esters are the mono- and di-alkyl esters of orthophosphoric acid, the alkyl groups of which contain 2-18 carbon atoms. Polyisocyanate may be reacted with polyester in two stages-one before addition of the acid ester and the other before its neutralization. If desired an organic acid chloride may be added to the reaction mixture as described in Specification 790,543. Preferably the acid phosphate is added to the hot reaction product and the acid chloride added by subsequent cold milling. Suitable bases for neutralizing the acid phosphates are diphenylamine, p-phenylenediamine, diphenylguanidine, guanidine, aniline, piperidine, benzylidene, dipiperidine, aminopyridine, 2,2 - dipyridylamine, 2 - amino - 4,6-dimethylpyridine, urea, hexamethylene tetramine, hydrazine hydrate, magnesium oxide, calcium hydroxide, and ammonium carbonate. In the Examples: (1) hot dehydrated polyethylene glycol wax mixed with naphthalene-1.5-diisocyanate followed by 1.4-butylene glycol as a cross-linking agent. Butyl acid phosphate was added. The mixture was heated, milled and divided into four parts which were milled to give sheets after various periods of storage, the sheets being moulded after neutralization of the acid phosphate with diphenylamine; (2) is similar to (1) but the cross-linking agent was added as an amine or mixture of amines in excess of the amount required to neutralize the butyl acid phosphate; (3) is also similar but employs a mixture of mono-ethyl and di-ethyl hydrogen phosphates; (4), (5) and (6) are similar to (2) but illustrate the addition of p-nitro-benzoyl chloride as well as butyl acid phosphate.",DUNLOP RUBBER CO,JONES FREDERICK ARTHUR;;COOPER WILFRED;;BOWEN DANIEL OWEN;;GRIFFITHS WILLIAM ALUN,,https://lens.org/125-674-844-306-274,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,3,0,C08G18/089;;C08G18/10,C08G18/08;;C08G18/10,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Prior to moulding the acid chloride is neutralized by milling in an organic or inorganic base so that curing may take place. The polyurethane may be the reaction product of a polyisocyanate with a polyether, polyester or polyesteramide. Additional polyisocyanate may be incorporated, prior to neutralizing the acid chloride, to bring the proportion of polyisocyanate up to 1.4 to 1.6 mols. per mol. polyester if the initial quantity of polyisocyanate is less than this. The intermediate product may be reacted with polyfunctional compounds such as water, polyhydric alcohols, polyamines and aminoalcohols. The acid chloride may be the chloride of an aliphatic aromatic mono- or dibasic acid. The chloride may be a carbonyl or sulphonyl chloride. In Example (1) one hundred parts of polyglycol adipate of molecular weight 1650 and acid number 1-4 were reacted with 18 parts of 1.5 naphthalene diisocyanate and the product with two parts 1,4 butane diol. To separate portions were then added 0.1, 0.25, 0.4 and 0.5 per cent by weight phthaloyl chloride and milled to test sheeting and tackiness qualities. The various products were then divided into two portions into one of which was milled 1 per cent diphenylamine, this portion then being moulded directly. The other portion was stored for 24 hours, milled with 1 per cent diphenylamine and moulded. The processing properties of the various portions are compared. In Example (2) the physical properties of test specimens are compared after storing for from 2-6 days before incorporation of diphenylamine and 2.21 dipyridylamine as neutralizer for the p-nitrobenzoyl chloride used as stabilizer- Six other examples are given.",DUNLOP RUBBER CO,JONES FREDERICK ARTHUR;;COOPER WILFRID;;BOWEN DANIEL OWEN;;GRIFFITHS WILLIAM ALUN,,https://lens.org/084-291-402-258-443,Granted Patent,no,0,2,2,2,0,C08G18/089,C08G18/08,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A low voltage optical phase modulator includes a splitter having an input, a first output, and a second output. The input receives an optical signal and is split between the first and second outputs. A phase adjustment element is coupled to the second output and produces a predetermined optical shift in the optical signal to produce a phase-shifted optical signal. A first electroabsorptive element is coupled to the first output and blocks transmission of the optical signal when the first electroabsorptive element is activated with a low voltage. A second electroabsorptive element is coupled to the phase adjustment element and blocks transmission of the phase-shifted optical signal when the second electroabsorptive element is activated using the low voltage. An optical combiner having a first combiner input, a second combiner input, and a combiner output is coupled to the first and second electroabsorptive elements and receives the optical signal and the phase-shifted optical signal. The combiner combines these optical signals to produce a binary encoded optical signal. The present invention thus achieves an improved low voltage optical phase modulator. The present invention is advantageous in that substantially larger than 180 degrees phase shift can be achieved with the same low voltage by using optical paths having longer lengths.

    Virtual display layers are associated with each process within a programmable set top box requiring access to a shared front panel display therein. An ordered set of virtual display layers is used to determine the information that is ultimately displayed on the shared display device. The shared display device includes a plurality of selectively controllable light emitting diode (LED) elements located on the front panel of the set top box. These LED elements correspond to data defined in the virtual display layers. The data includes flag data that associates certain properties with an element, mask data that identifies if the element is visible (e.g., opaque) or not visible (e.g., transparent) to the process, and context data that sets the state or status of the element (e.g., ON/OFF). A composite display layer is created using applicable data from the ordered set of virtual display layers. The resulting composite display layer provides the data that defines the information displayed via the display device.

A positively positionable multi-disk wrist mechanism includes a plurality of disks or vertebrae stacked in series. Each vertebra is configured to rotate in pitch or in yaw with respect to each neighboring vertebra. Actuation cables are used to manipulate and control movement of the vertebrae. In specific embodiments, some of the cables are distal cables that extend from a proximal vertebra through one or more intermediate vertebrae to a distal vertebra, while the remaining cables are medial cables that extend from the proximal vertebra to one or more of the intermediate vertebrae. The cables are actuated by a pivoted plate cable actuator mechanism.",INTUITIVE SURGICAL OPERATIONS,COOPER THOMAS G;;WALLACE DANIEL T;;CHANG STACEY;;ANDERSON S CHRISTOPHER;;WILLIAMS DUSTIN,INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC (2002-10-15);;INTUITIVE SURGICAL OPERATIONS INC (2010-02-19),https://lens.org/104-269-870-909-115,Granted Patent,yes,381,836,54,154,0,A61B2017/00314;;A61B2017/2929;;A61B1/0055;;A61B1/008;;A61B1/0057;;A61B2017/2908;;A61B34/71;;A61B34/30;;A61B2034/304;;A61B2034/305;;A61B2034/306;;A61B34/72;;A61B2017/2936;;A61B17/00234;;A61B2017/00314;;A61B2017/2929;;A61B2017/2936;;A61B2017/2908;;A61B34/71;;A61B34/30;;A61B2034/304;;A61B2034/305;;A61B2034/306;;A61B34/72;;A61B1/0055;;A61B1/008;;A61B1/0057;;A61B17/00234;;A61B2017/0069,A61B17/00;;A61B1/00;;A61B1/005;;A61B1/008;;A61B17/28;;A61B17/29;;A61B17/32;;A61B19/00;;A61B34/00;;A61B34/30,,103,28,111-776-308-438-58X;;084-635-431-833-749;;109-993-519-347-249;;019-166-005-806-186;;032-870-506-711-775;;002-075-385-807-349;;011-406-848-501-646;;064-596-870-113-546;;079-181-651-083-009;;138-018-843-178-721;;163-385-194-714-07X;;043-035-799-574-89X;;029-563-330-156-983;;032-486-015-085-195;;084-079-828-658-876;;019-610-405-380-776;;022-602-100-454-437;;094-800-561-507-502;;081-822-251-527-423;;063-666-273-541-678;;048-589-882-439-556;;043-884-745-793-305;;129-450-613-562-070;;036-411-148-159-61X;;066-262-815-930-597;;029-210-675-169-17X;;110-199-477-118-874;;087-753-783-911-014,10.1007/978-3-662-40393-8_9;;10.1177/027836498800700201;;10.1017/s0263574700006457;;10.1002/(sici)1098-2728(1996)8:1<25::aid-lra4>3.0.co;2-z;;10.1109/robot.1991.131973;;10.1109/70.499826;;10.1109/robot.1987.1088064;;10.1109/51.391769;;10.1109/iembs.1989.96028;;10.1109/robot.1988.12114;;10.1109/robot.1994.350945;;10.1163/156855390x00116;;10.1016/0736-5845(89)90118-x;;10.1109/70.313096;;10.1109/robot.1989.100211;;10.1109/cmpcon.1988.4927;;10.1109/iros.1994.407520;;10.1109/robot.1995.525403;;10.1109/10.1354;;3280462;;10.1007/bf02615402;;10.1109/iros.1998.727320;;10.1109/robot.2002.1014698;;10.1109/iros.1999.811680;;10.1117/12.19908;;10.1109/cdc.1990.203551;;10.1109/70.88022;;10.1109/robot.1989.100098;;10.23919/acc.1988.4789933,"Adams, Ludwig et al., “Computer-Assisted Surgery,” IEEE Computer Graphics & Applications, May 1990, pp. 43-52, vol. 10—Issue 3, IEEE Computer Society Press.;;Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Japan, “Introduction to New Project for the National Research Development Program (Large-Scale Project) in FY 1991—Micromachine Technology,” 1991, 8 pages.;;Alexander, Arthur D.

   A fuel swirler plate for improving atomization of fuel in a fuel injector. A plurality of identical fuel supply passages is formed in the plate, each passage including an outer fuel reservoir region; a region having converging walls wherein fuel is accelerated and turned partially tangential to the axis of the plate and fuel injector; a metering region wherein flow is regulated; and an exit region wherein the fuel is combined with similar fuel flows from the other passages to form a high velocity swirl annulus between the swirler plate and a pintle ball of the fuel injector. An advantage of the novel swirl plate over prior art plates is that, when the injector valve is closed, only a very small volume of fuel resides in the swirl annulus between the pintle ball and the exit region of the plate, and such residual fuel is urged rotationally and becomes the leading edge of a new vortex the next time the valve is opened, thus minimizing SAC spray formation. The present invention is useful in fuel cells, burners, and in both direct injection and port injection fuel injectors of internal combustion engines.

The controlled proteolytic degradation may be achieved by tagging the coding sequence of a protein with a peptide sequence (e.g. a DAS+4 tag) such that it is recognised by a protein that binds the tag (e.g sspB) so that it is targeted for degradation by a protease (e.g clpXP), wherein either the protease or the binding protein are expressed from an inducible promoter.

An advantage of the novel swirl plate over prior art plates is that, when the injector valve is closed, only a very small volume of fuel resides in the swirl annulus between the pintle ball and the exit region of the plate, and such residual fuel is urged rotationally and becomes the leading edge of a new vortex the next time the valve is opened, thus minimizing SAC spray formation.

A plurality of identical fuel supply passages is formed in the plate, each passage including an outer fuel reservoir region; a region having converging walls wherein fuel is accelerated and turned partially tangential to the axis of the plate and fuel injector; a metering region wherein flow is regulated; and an exit region wherein the fuel is combined with similar fuel flows from the other passages to form a high velocity swirl annulus between the swirler plate and a pintle ball of the fuel injector. An advantage of the novel swirl plate over prior art plates is that, when the injector valve is closed, only a very small volume of fuel resides in the swirl annulus between the pintle ball and the exit region of the plate, and such residual fuel is urged rotationally and becomes the leading edge of a new vortex the next time the valve is opened, thus minimizing SAC spray formation.

   The present invention is directed to a tool having a wrist mechanism that provides pitch and yaw rotation in such a way that the tool has no singularity in roll, pitch, and yaw. A positively positionable multi-disk wrist mechanism includes a plurality of disks or vertebrae stacked in series. Each vertebra is configured to rotate in pitch or in yaw with respect to each neighboring vertebra. Actuation cables are used to manipulate and control movement of the vertebrae. In specific embodiments, some of the cables are distal cables that extend from a proximal vertebra through one or more intermediate vertebrae to a distal vertebra, while the remaining cables are medial cables that extend from the proximal vertebra to one or more of the intermediate vertebrae. The cables are actuated by a pivoted plate cable actuator mechanism. In specific embodiments, the actuator mechanism includes a plurality of small radius holes or grooves for receiving the medial cables and a plurality of large radius holes or grooves for receiving the distal cables. The holes or grooves restrain the medial cables to a small radius of motion and the distal cables to a large radius of motion, so that the medial cables to the medial vertebra move only a fraction of the amount as the distal cables to the distal vertebra, so as to achieve precise control and manipulation of the vertebrae.

A positively positionable multi-disk wrist mechanism includes a plurality of disks or vertebrae stacked in series. Each vertebra is configured to rotate in pitch or in yaw with respect to each neighboring vertebra. Actuation cables are used to manipulate and control movement of the vertebrae. In specific embodiments, some of the cables are distal cables that extend from a proximal vertebra through one or more intermediate vertebrae to a distal vertebra, while the remaining cables are medial cables that extend from the proximal vertebra to one or more of the intermediate vertebrae. The cables are actuated by a pivoted plate cable actuator mechanism. In specific embodiments, the actuator mechanism includes a plurality of small radius holes or grooves for receiving the medial cables and a plurality of large radius holes or grooves for receiving the distal cables. The holes or grooves restrain the medial cables to a small radius of motion and the distal cables to a large radius of motion, so that the medial cables to the medial vertebra move only a fraction of the amount as the distal cables to the distal vertebra, so as to achieve precise control and manipulation of the vertebrae.
