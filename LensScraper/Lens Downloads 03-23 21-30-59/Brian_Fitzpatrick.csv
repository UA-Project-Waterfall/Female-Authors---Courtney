SOLUTION: A FLOAM(R) bag comprises two layers of thermoplastic sheet materials 31, 32 containing particles 33 in lubricant, and the bag is filled with pherical material or particles in lubricant. The particles can be inserted into the FLOAM(R) pad through a filter tube 28, and after the insertion, the tube 28 is sealed at an end of the bag and removed. An air bag and the FLOAM(R) bag are secured together along the sealed line positioned apart from the circumferential edge of the bag. The attaching line positions of the two bags are located so that the circumferential edge can be expanded freely in the form of bellows, whereby the flexibility of the FLOAM(R) bag is increased when it is brought into a body of patient and a distribution of force to the contour of hand or leg is made uniform.",JOHNSON & JOHNSON PROFESSIONAL,FITZPATRICK BRIAN;;LANCASTER RONALD;;PEKAR ROBERT W,,https://lens.org/023-784-291-141-439,Patent Application,no,0,3,4,4,0,A61F5/0123;;A61F5/34;;A61F2005/0174;;A61F5/0123;;A61F2005/0174;;A61F5/34,A61F5/01;;A61F5/02;;A61F5/34;;A47C27/08,,0,0,,,,PENDING

   The present invention relates to an intravaginal catamenial device having a distensible member for sealingly engaging walls of a vagina. Inflating the distensible member provides immediate expansion after insertion into the vagina, thereby minimizing the potential for any by-pass leakage of bodily fluids. The device of the present invention employs a valve mechanism capable of two-way fluid communication that enables both inflation and deflation of the device. The distensible member may be of any shape that is useful for blocking and/or collecting bodily fluids.

The acetic acid is produced by reacting methanol and carbon monoxide in the presence of a carbonylation catalyst. The method comprises reacting an aldehyde-containing stream with an alcohol to form an acetal-containing stream. An acetal-enriched stream is separated from the acetal-containing stream and then hydrolyzed to form a hydrolysis mixture comprising the alcohol and the aldehydes. The alcohol is isolated from the hydrolysis mixture and used to react with the aldehyde-containing stream to form the acetal-containing stream.

To obtain this specified character, the unconstrained characters are stored in a video line buffer as a plurality of rows of binary bits. When a row character is located in the video line buffer a process of vertical and horizontal consolidation is initiated. In the vertical consolidation, which is performed first, predetermined rows of the bits of the row character are selectively combined with other rows of stored bits or selected without change to reduce the height of the character to a predetermined desired height. Unselected rows are ignored. As the rows of bits are obtained during vertical consolidation, horizontal consolidation of each row is initiated.

This may be accomplished by taking a relatively unconstrained hand printed character and, through simple logical processes involving eliminating and/or combining portions of the unconstrained character, obtain a constrained character of a specified size. To obtain this specified character, the unconstrained characters are stored in a video line buffer as a plurality of rows of binary bits. When a row character is located in the video line buffer a process of vertical and horizontal consolidation is initiated. In the vertical consolidation, which is performed first, predetermined rows of the bits of the row character are selectively combined with other rows of stored bits or selected without change to reduce the height of the character to a predetermined desired height. Unselected rows are ignored. As the rows of bits are obtained during vertical consolidation, horizontal consolidation of each row is initiated. This consolidation is performed on a byte by byte basis so that each row is transformed in accordance with a predetermined relationship between the width of the row character and the desired width.",IBM,BEDNAR GREGORY M;;FITZPATRICK BRIAN E;;HARMON JOHN C;;NARASIMHA MANTHRI S I,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION A CORP.
