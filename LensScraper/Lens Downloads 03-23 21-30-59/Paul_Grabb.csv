The existence of such periodicity is used to render a portion of each frame to zeros. The next steps are to search for and remove correlations between the bits in a set of frames, denoted {F.sub.i *}. The compression algorithm implementing the method according to the invention has four sub-steps; Data preconditioning, Compression and coding of first frame, F.sub.1, Compression and coding of frames 2-.delta., F.sub.1 -F.sub..delta., and Compression and coding of F.sub..delta.+1 and on, the steady-state mode.",GEN ELECTRIC,HERSHEY JOHN ERIK;;JOSHI NAMITA;;GRABB MARK LEWIS;;ROSS JOHN ANDERSON FERGUS;;NOWAK THOMAS GERARD;;STAUDINGER VINCENT PAUL,GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY (1999-04-27),https://lens.org/109-437-740-237-279,Granted Patent,yes,2,7,1,1,0,H03M7/46;;H03M7/46;;H03M7/30;;H03M7/30;;H03M7/40;;H03M7/40,H03M7/30;;H03M7/40;;H03M7/46,341/65;;341/87;;348/390;;348/416,2,2,071-847-707-696-494;;053-601-017-503-250,10.1109/dcc.1991.213314;;10.1109/tit.1982.1056593,"Satellite Data Archives Algorithm, K.
