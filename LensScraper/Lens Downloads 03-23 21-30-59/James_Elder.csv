    A multi-grit manual finishing tool and method for making the tool. In a preferred embodiment, the tool comprises an ordered, linear sequence of pieces of coated abrasive connected by fully pliable hinges. The hinges allow virtually 360 rotation of the planes of adjacent pieces about each other, and permit the tool to accordion-fold together tightly, so that the tool becomes very compact for storage, transit and special uses. The grit sizes progressively increase from one abrasive piece to the next, thereby facilitating a choice of grit sizes within a single tool. On the non-grit surface of each piece is a distinctive labeling addition that includes indicia characterizing the grit size and abrasive nature of its corresponding grit surface. The distinctive labeling addition includes mechanical reinforcement, such as plastic, thin metal or cardboard. Each piece may abrade a work piece individually and without necessarily using any tool other than hand or fingers. By trial application to a work piece, the tool user can selectively determine from the indicia the most suitable grit sizes for finishing the piece. Methods of construction, use, and modification of such a tool are described.

Craig, J., and Rowan, R. E. Jan. 9. Glass furnaces; charging and discharging.-Relates to a method and apparatus for flattening glass cylinders into sheets for window glass &c. and for polishing them. The apparatus is shown in Fig. 1 in longitudinal section, in Fig. 5 in plan, and in Fig. 3 in cross-section. The cylinder A is cracked longitudinally and introduced into a chamber 7, where it receives a preliminary heating. It is then conveyed on a carriage 9, sliding on a track 8, into the main chamber 2, which is heated by gas jets 5, or it may be introduced directly through an opening 2<1> in the chamber 2. The cylinder is then seized by tongs 15, 16, the lower member 15 of which is secured to a tube 14 and the upper member 16 to a rod 17 terminating in a spring diaphragm 18<1> contained in a chamber 18. The members 15,16 are connected by a link so that, on compressed air being admitted to the chamber 18, the rod 17 is projected forward, causing the tongs to close. To enable the tongs to grip the cylinder, the track 8 and hence the cylinder A may be raised or lowered by links 8<1> fixed on shafts 10 operated by outside cranks 10<1>. The tube 14 is supported by antifriction rollers 21<1> mounted upon a frame 21 hung from a crane &c. The cylinder is carried to the centre of the chamber 2, where the heat causes it to flatten out and hang vertically. If sufficiently flat, the glass may be removed at this stage as described below or it may be further flattened by means of rollers 26, 30, 31 mounted upon the ends of the rods 24 of pistons contained by cylinders 23. Toothed wheels 27, Fig. 9, on the ends of the rollers 26 engage corresponding wheels 28, which are operated by a vertical rack 29, Fig. 1, when the piston-rods 24 are forced upwards. The rollers 30, 31 are mounted on pivoted links so that their distance from the rollers 26 can be varied. When at the bottom, the rollers are kept apart by an incline 33, Fig. 3, but when they are near the top the ends of the spindles of the rollers 30, 31 strike the right-hand portions of fixed double inclines 34, 34<1> and are moved towards the opposite rollers 26, being allowed to fall gently into contact with the glass by the left-hand portions of the double inclines 34, 34<1> as the rollers are lowered. The distance between the rollers is determined by conical caps 35, Fig. 11, on the ends of the rollers 26, adjusting-screws 36 being fitted. The finished sheet is then passed through an opening 6' into the chamber 7, where it is raised to a horizontal position by a pivoted table 37. When in this position, bars 39 from the annealing-leer pass into grooves 37' in the table 37 and remove the plate.",CRAIG JAMES;;ROWAN ROBERT ELDER,CRAIG JAMES;;ROWAN ROBERT ELDER,,https://lens.org/194-976-296-037-793,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Signals outside the band of frequencies are passed with a constant degree of loss by the variolosser. Each variolosser is controlled by a control circuit which is responsive to the amplitude envelope of signals having frequencies within the operational band of the associated variolosser. When the signal processing circuit is used to provide compression and expansion functions in a plural band compandor, phase shift introduced into signals having frequencies near the operational limits of one frequency restrictive means, in the compressor, is substantially corrected by complementary phase shift introduced in the expandor. Further, signal cancellation and reinforcement is avoided.

In the human eye, a compromise has evolved in which resolution is high near the optical axis, but falls off with eccentricity. The effective resolution of the system is extended by fast gaze-shifting mechanisms and a memory system that allows a form of integration over multiple fixations. We have constructed an artificial visual system based on these concepts. The peripheral component consists of a catadioptric video sensor that provides a panoramic FOV. The foveal component is a video pan/tilt camera with 14 deg FOV. Calibration yields a table of projective parameters, indexed by foveal pan/tilt coordinates, that allows rapid transfer of pixels between foveal an d panoramic coordinate frames. A second transform maps between sensor and display frames. Alpha masking yields a circular, smoothly blended fovea embedded in the lower resolution panoramic image. The system may be operated in 3 modes. In slaved mode, mouse-clicks in the display generate saccade commands to the pan/tilt platform. In autonomous mode, saccades are entirely determined by motion detected in the peripheral sensor. In semi-autonomous mode these two independent motor command streams are arbitratedto produce a system responsive to operator interest as well as autonomously- detected motion events. The display duration of foveal images from past fixations is determined by a memory parameter. At one extreme, previous foveal data are immediately replaced by more recent lo w resolution data from the panoramic sensor. At the other extreme, a sequence of fixations builds up a persistent high resolution mosaic. In intermediate modes, foveal data from previous fixations gradually fade into more recent low-resolution data. The system is presently operating on a Pentium platform at 15 fps.</SDO AB>",ELDER JAMES H;;GOLDSTEIN RONEN;;HOU YUQIAN,ELDER JAMES H;;GOLDSTEIN RONEN;;HOU YUQIAN,,https://lens.org/083-573-626-462-901,Patent Application,no,0,4,1,8,0,G06T3/4038;;H04N7/185;;H04N23/60;;H04N23/698;;G06T3/047;;H04N23/60,G06T3/00;;H04N5/232;;H04N7/18,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

For normal operation, a piston (48) of a piston assembly (46) is maintained in a first position by pressurized fuel in a volume on a first side of the piston (48). In response to engine shut-down, pressure is removed from the first side of the piston and fuel in the volume on the first side of the piston (48) is drained into a return conduit that is part of the fuel system's thermal management system. Displacement of the piston in response to removal of pressure on the first side of the piston (48) creates a volume on a second side of the piston for drainage of fuel from a fuel manifold.

   The present invention provides a process for accurately combining low-resolution and high-resolution video streams into a single seamless display to a human observer. The present invention also provides a method for the smooth blending of high- and low-resolution video boundary. In order to create an effective visual display, it is advantageous that the boundary between high- and low-resolution video not be overly distracting and irregular. The present method to reduce distractions from the quadrilateral boundary between low-and high-resolution video by smoothly blending the two in an annular region between the two. This results in a much more visually pleasing, effective display. The present invention also provides a method for progressively mosaicking high resolution imagery over a low resolution image captured by our panoramic sensor. The observer is continuously presented with a low-resolution panoramic image of a remote scene, and this image is updated with high-resolution imagery from the high-resolution sensor, at selected locations of interest, as they are available.

The method generally comprises selecting and placing attenuating material in the defined region of the process vessel, wherein the selected attenuating material maintains its physical shape under the operating conditions. The attenuating material should occupy at least 20% of the volume of the defined region of the process vessel. Use of the inventive method may be beneficially applied for the safe operation of oxidation reactors with flammable, high hydrocarbon concentration feeds in order to attain increased productivity. The invention also provides a tubular reactor adapted for attenuation of deflagration pressure resulting from combustion of combustible gas in a defined region therein, wherein the defined region of the tubular reactor comprises attenuating material selected in accordance with the aforesaid method for attenuating deflagration pressure and which have a plurality of components which are placed such that void spaces and open pathways between the components are minimized. A method for performing gas phase reactions safely under flammable operating conditions is also provided, wherein a gas feed composition comprising a hydrocarbon and oxygen is subjected reaction in a reaction vessel having attenuating materials therein and the reaction is conducted at a temperature and a pressure which render the reaction system flammable.

To produce the novel isomer, ammonium dimolybdate (""ADM"") is combined with molybdenum trioxide (MoO.sub.3) and water to yield a mixture. When mixing these materials, optimum results are achieved if at least one of the foregoing molybdenum-containing reagents is added in a gradual, non-instantaneous manner so that the selected reagent is not added to the mixture in a single large mass. This gradual delivery procedure, along with a carefully controlled prolonged heating stage (e.g. in excess of 3 hours) contributes to a maximum yield of high purity X-AOM.",CYPRUS AMAX MINERALS CO,KHAN MOHAMED H;;COLE JAMES A;;BRUHL TIMOTHY G;;ELDER WENDELL S;;GLASGOW GARY A;;WAGH VIJAYKUMAR M,CLIMAX MOLYBDENUM COMPANY (2002-02-14),https://lens.org/127-249-555-449-928,Granted Patent,yes,19,8,16,16,0,C01G39/00;;C01G39/00,C01G39/00,423/593;;423/606;;502/305,1,0,,,"Robert Thornton Morrison & Robert Nelson Boyd, NY University entitled ""Organic Chemistry"" Allyn and Bacon, Inc., Boston-London-Sydney 3rd Ed. p. 37 (1973).",EXPIRED

   A gas-fired water heater has a combustion chamber with a bottom wall defined by a perforated flame arrestor plate forming a portion of a flow path through which combustion air may be supplied to a burner structure within the combustion chamber. During firing of the water heater a combustion air shutoff system senses an undesirable temperature increase in the combustion chamber, caused by for example a partial blockage of the flow path, and responsively terminates further air flow into the combustion chamber, thereby shutting down the burner, prior to the creation in the combustion chamber of a predetermined elevated concentration of carbon monoxide.

CONSTITUTION: Whether a waste stream having a feed rate and a fuel content is being fed into an incinerator, is discriminated. A CO emission rate of the emission products for calculating a delta CO, which is equal to the CO emission rate minus a target rate and is less than or greater than 0, is evaluated. A firebox temperature in response to increases or decreases in the deltaCO is adjusted. The target rate is less than 500 lbs/hr. An evaluation of the CO emission rate is accomplished by using a CO analyzer, an O2 analyzer, a Gas Chromatograph, a Mass Spectrometer, or a Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer combination. If deltaCO is greater than 0, the firebox temperature of the incinerator is increased by a deltaX. If deltaCO is less than 0, the firebox temperature of the incinerator is decreased by a deltaY.",ROHM & HAAS,COCHRAN MAYRA RODRIGUEZ;;DAFFT CHARLES ANTHONY;;DECOURCY MICHAEL STANLEY;;ELDER JAMES EDWARD;;FENDT FREDERICK PAUL;;HENDERSON JOHN EDWARD,,https://lens.org/155-434-559-022-542,Patent Application,no,0,1,17,17,0,F23G5/50;;F23G2207/103;;F23G2207/104;;F23G2207/112;;F23G2900/55003;;F23G2900/55011;;F23N5/003;;F23N5/02;;F23N2221/10;;F23N2225/16;;F23N2241/18;;F23G7/00;;F23G5/50;;F23G2207/112;;F23G2207/104;;F23N5/02;;F23G2207/103;;F23G2900/55011;;F23N5/003;;F23G2900/55003;;F23N2221/10;;F23N2225/16;;F23N2241/18,F23G5/50;;G01N27/62;;F23G7/00;;F23G7/04;;F23N5/00;;F23N5/02;;G01N30/88;;G01N33/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
