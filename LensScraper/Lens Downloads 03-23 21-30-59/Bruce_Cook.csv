Each sensor assembly includes a number of like sensors measuring the same parameters. The sets of process signals derived from the sensor assemblies (61, 69,...) are each in its turn transmitted from the protection system to the control system (55) which impresses control signals on the reactor or its components to counteract the tendency for conditions to drift off-normal status requiring operation of the protection system. A parameter signal selector (111, 113) is interposed between the protection system and the control system. This selector prevents a parameter signal of a set of signals, which differs from the other parameter signals of the set by more than twice the allowable variation of the sensors which produce the set, from passing to the control system. The selectors include a pair of signal selection units, one unit (111) sending selected process signals to primary control channels (141) and the other (113) sending selected process signals to back-up control channels (143). Test signals are periodically impressed by a test unit (115) on a selected pair of a selected unit and control channels. When test signals are so impressed the selected control channel is disabled from transmitting control signals to the reactor and/or its associated components. This arrangement eliminates the possibility that a single component failure which may be spurious will cause an inadvertent trip of the reactor during test.",WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC CORPORATION,"COOK, BRUCE M.",,https://lens.org/087-264-593-827-869,Search Report,yes,7,0,22,23,0,F22B35/004;;G05B9/03;;G21D3/10;;Y02E30/00;;Y02E30/30;;G21C17/00;;G21D3/10;;F22B35/004;;G05B9/03;;Y02E30/30,F22B35/00;;G21C7/00;;G05B9/03;;G21C17/00;;G21D3/10,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Sept. 1, 1962, No. 33632/62. Heading A5B. A diagnostic non-toxic fluent material comprises a mixture of a fluid silicone rubber and a catalyst capable of setting the said rubber, which mixture is introduceable into the intestine of a living animal, and capable of foaming and setting within said intestine at a temperature compatible with cell viability to a surface-conforming coherent, unplastic, pliant condition, with a sufficient by fine-grained surface to reproduce for diagnosis the physical features of abnormalities sought to be detected, and sufficient radiopaque substance to render the fluent material readily observable radiologically when said material is within the body of the living animal. In one example, the catalyst is stannous actoate, the radiopaque material is diatrizoate sodium and the room-temperature-vulcanizing silicone rubber consists of a mixture of a liquid prepolymer dimethyl silicone of 45,000 cs, fluid silicone rubber foam of 5000 cs and cyclic dimethyl polysiloxane of 20 cs. The radiopaque material may also be sodium acetriazoate, sodium diprotrizoate, diatrizoate methyl glucamine, ethyl iodophenylundecylate and barium sulphate. The material may be administered using a plastic bag 1 containing the settable liquid and a rupturable container of catalyst 2 associated with means for introducing the material into the intestine (Fig. 1).",BAXTER LABORATORIES INC,COOK GALEN BRUCE,,https://lens.org/186-728-444-753-28X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,A61K49/0447;;C08L83/04;;C08G77/04,A61K49/04;;C08L83/04,A5B B760          L;;A5B B776          L,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Stacking apparatus; endless conveyers. BUTTERLEY CO. Ltd. 11 Jan., 1966 [14 Oct., 1964], No. 41865/64. Headings B8A and B8C. Blocks of concrete, &c., to be stacked are transferred from a driven endless conveyer 15 on to a free-wheeling conveyer 21 having control means such as an adjustable friction disc 22 to limit the extent of free-running thereof, on which conveyer they move closer together. The leading block on the conveyer 21 operates a switch 24 which stops the drive of conveyer 15 and permits the assembled blocks to be lifted by a gripper 27 and carried to the stacking station, which may be on a further conveyer. In the embodiment there is a pair of parallel conveyers 21 and side members 23 alongside the conveyers 21 raise the blocks from the surface of the conveyers 21 prior to lifting by the gripper 27. A switch 21A operates an interlock which prevents the conveyer 15 from moving while the members 23 are elevated. The gripper 27, which may be rotatable through 90 degrees so that alternate layers of the stack may be of different orientation, runs on a gantry 26 either parallel to or perpendicular to the direction of the conveyers 15, 21. The blocks are delivered initially to the conveyer 15 by a gripper 12 running on a gantry 11, a switch 15A being provided to ensure that the gripper 12 does not lower blocks on to the conveyer 15 while other blocks are still stationary on it. Both grippers 27, 15 may be controlled either manually or by a system of switches. Delivery of blocks to the stacking apparatus may be made by a pallet conveyer 14.",BUTTERLEY CO LTD,COOK PETER BRUCE,,https://lens.org/114-577-414-889-429,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,B65G43/08,B65G43/08,B8A AED           AED;;B8A AT1           AED;;B8A A1C2E         -;;B8A A1C2L2A       -;;B8A A1C2L2B       -;;B8A A1C2Q         -;;B8A A1C2S         -;;B8A A1C3L2A       -;;B8A A1C3L2B       -;;B8A A1C3Q         -;;B8A A1C3S         -;;B8A A1D7A1        A1D7;;B8A A1N           -;;B8C CSF5          CSF5;;B8C C1B1A         1Z;;B8C C10B1A        1Z;;B8C C10B1D1       1Z;;B8C C10B1D2A      1Z;;B8C C10B1D3       1Z;;B8C C10B1F2       1Z;;B8C C10L1A        1Z;;B8C C10L2A        1Z;;B8C C40B1A        CSF5;;B8C C40B1D1       CSF5;;B8C C40B1D2A      CSF5;;B8C C40B1D3       CSF5;;B8C C40B1F2       CSF5;;B8C C9            1Z,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Each of the logic paths is constructed of basic logic units which in turn, each include a toroidal core of rectangular hysteresis loop magnetic material having a control winding which must be energized by a dc current in order for pulses applied to an input winding to appear at an output winding. Blockage of pulses through any one of the serially connected basic logic units in a logic path terminates the flow of pulses to the converter through that logic path. The control windings of corresponding logic units of the trip logic path in each channel are energized by one of a set of redundant sensors which monitor one of a plurality of reactor trip parameters. Dynamic voting logic appropriate for existing conditions is implemented in part by microprocessors in each channel which gather status information from the other channels through isolated, fiber optic, multiplexed data links and provide the switching logic for alternate paths for energization of the individual basic logic unit control windings, so that for instance, coincidence of trip signals from corresponding sensors in at least two out of four unbypassed channels is required to trip the reactor switchgear. Local bypasses provide additional energization paths for the control windings of basic logic units associated with sensors which are out of service or being repaired. Pulses propagate through the basic logic units of the global bypass path when an entire channel is taken out of service for treating or maintenance. Interlocks between logic units in the trip logic and global bypass logic paths permit only one path to deliver pulses to the converter at any given instant.",WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC CORP,COOK BRUCE M;;GUTMAN JERZY,WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC CO.

   A modified offset parabolic antenna is disclosed which provides improved gain when receiving satellite broadcasts from geosynchronous transmission sources spaced substantially 10 degrees apart. The surface of the reflector is defined by a Zernike expansion mapped to a unit circle. The values of the parameters of the Zernike expansion are selected to provide a shaped reflector surface which focuses beams from the three separate sources onto three focal points such that the gain of the antenna is maximized. A peak beam gain for an offset beam of substantially 33.9 dBi has been achieved.

Loads and moments acting on the rim of the wheel are transferred through the spoke-like load cells to the hub of the wheel. Sensors strategically positioned around the circumference of the tubular load cell monitor the intensity of the loads and moments. To detect angular position of the wheel, a light source generates a cone of polarized light to flood the wheel of the vehicle and detector-polarizing filter pairs detect an angle of the polarization relative to the wheel to determine its angular position.

A computing operation may be performed to generate a code (e.g., a hash code) for each attribute in the diagnostic data. The generated code(s) may be combined to form a diagnostic identifier to identify the diagnostic data. A comparison may be performed by comparing each code in one diagnostic identifier to a code in another diagnostic identifier corresponding to an attribute for which the codes were generated. A measure of a match between the two identifiers may be determined using a result of the comparison.

A control rod strategy computer provides for dynamic control of core power distribution in both radial and axial directions and forms the basis for a partial trip capability. Several microprocessor-based computation centers are combined together in a data-sharing network which processors determine local power density, determine the instantaneous differential and integral reactivity worth of each group of control rods, determine and effectuate partial trip for immediate power reduction, determine and provide for uniform core burnup, and effectuate core reactivity changes by directing the movement of groups of four control rods from zero to one hundred percent of travel while minimizing power distribution factors throughout the core. The power control circuitry to move the groups of control rods are bus arranged such that the power circuitry is shared among the groups of control rods. In this manner, the power to the control rod drive mechanisms is controlled and bus arranged for distribution to these drive mechanisms.

Transmission electron microscopy studies show that the as-deposited films are amorphous, regardless of substrate temperature; however, analysis of FTIR spectra suggests that the higher substrate temperature facilitates formation of the B 12 icosahedral framework, therefore leading to the higher hardness.",UNIV IOWA STATE RES FOUND INC,COOK BRUCE ALLAN;;TIAN YUN;;HARRINGA JOEL LEE;;CONSTANT ALAN PAUL;;RUSSELL ALAN MARK;;MOLIAN PALANIAPPA A,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FOUNDATION INC (2004-08-26),https://lens.org/149-739-177-053-239,Granted Patent,yes,4,13,2,2,0,B81B3/0075;;B81C2201/032;;C23C14/067;;C23C14/28;;Y10S428/938;;Y10T428/1275;;Y10T428/12736;;Y10T428/31678;;Y10T428/1275;;Y10T428/12736;;Y10T428/31678;;C23C14/067;;C23C14/28;;B81C2201/032;;B81B3/0075;;Y10S428/938,B32B15/20;;B32B15/04;;B81B3/00;;B81B7/00;;C22C21/00;;C23C14/06;;C23C14/16;;C23C14/28;;C23C14/34;;C23C16/00,428/650;;428/652;;428/938;;204/192.16;;427/250;;427/554,5,1,109-611-588-225-96X,10.1016/s0257-8972(02)00050-6,"Molian, Pal., et al., ""Nanocrystalline Thin Films of New Ultra-hard Borides for MEMS and Tooling Applications (DMI-0084969),"" Manuscript not published 2003; 10 pages; no date given.;;U.S. Appl.

   A component interface module (CIM) arbitrates through priority logic component command signals from redundant systems and integrates the selected priority command signal with component feedback signals in component logic to generate a control signal for a component in a complex plant. The non-software based CIM is programmable for use with a variety of plant components. The component logic includes blocking logic that prevents or terminates generation of the control signal such as when component activation has been completed. Diagnostics incorporated into the CIM include: an input port interface test, a pulse test that continuously checks for proper propagation of test pulses through the priority and component logic, and a test of the functioning of the CIM output device such as a relay.

The image is intact only when the sheet is in substantially a predetermined contour and viewed within a predetermined conical field of view. The figure shows a cross section of an embossed card (60) to the surface of which a microlens sheeting (62) comprising a monolayer of microspheres (64), a binder layer (66), and a layer of adhesive (68) was adhered before embossing. The card and adhered microlens sheeting have been embossed with desired characters (70, 72), such as with the account numbers on a credit card, and the sheeting has assumed a nonplanar contour. The embossing pattern has been altered by removing some characters (70, 72) and adding another (74). Due to the change of the contour of the card, the spatial arrangement between the individual axial markings has been altered, thereby disrupting the image, as represented by the nonparallel arrangement of the lines. Also a method for forming such sheets is presented.
