Automatic temperature control systems. VAPOR HEATING CORPORATION. June 21, 1956, No. 19269/56. Class 38 (4). [Also in Groups XIII and XXIX] In a combined space and water heating system (see Group XIII) for a railway car 10 a solenoid-actuated valve 82 is energized when the contacts 90 of a thermostat T are bridged by a mercury column and causes interruption of the steam supply to radiators 12 . . . 16. The valve 82 opens a by-pass 77 between a steam supply line 61 and a chamber containing a temperature responsive bellows and communicating with the steam return line from the radiators. Expansion of the bellows partly closes a valve in the steam supply line so that the resulting drop in pressure permits a relief valve supplying the radiators to close. Steam continues to flow through an exchanger 41 supplying hot water to wash-basins 45. The solenoid 82-is open-circuited and an electrical heater 85 is switched on by a switch S1 whenever a solenoid 88 is energized by opening of the contacts 90. The heater 85 provides a temperature rise, for example, of 2‹ F., to decrease the rate of rise in temperature in the car 10 before the contacts 90 close. A switch S enables the solenoid 82 to remain energized when car heating is not required.",VAPOR HEATING CORP,GILLICK LAURANCE HENRY;;LEHANE TIMOTHY JOHN,,https://lens.org/049-161-511-222-170,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,B61D35/002;;B61D27/0036;;F24D9/02,B61D27/00;;B61D35/00;;F24D9/02,F2V VW30          VW30;;F4A AB            AB;;F4U U42C          U42C;;G3R RBQ46         BQ46;;G3R RB4724        BQ46;;G3R RB482         BQ46,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
