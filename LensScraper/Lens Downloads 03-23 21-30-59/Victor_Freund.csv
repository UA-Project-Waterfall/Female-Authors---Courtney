The targeted agent is a cytotoxic agent, such as a ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) and an antisense nucleic acid, or is a therapeutic nucleic acid for targeted delivery to vascular endothelial cells. The targeted agent is attached to VEGF, or via a linker, through a chemical bond, or the conjugate is prepared as a chimera using techniques of recombinant DNA. The conjugates are used to target cytotoxic agents or therapeutic nucleotides to endothelial cells and are particularly useful for treating solid tumors, such as Kaposi's sarcoma, and for treating ophthalmic disorders with underlying vascular proliferation.",PRIZM PHARMA INC,SOSNOWSKI BARBARA A;;VICTOR KIMBERLY D;;HOUSTON L L;;NOVA MICHAEL P;;FREUND ERWIN;;FLEURBAAIJ GRAHAM A,,https://lens.org/134-234-202-175-53X,Patent Application,yes,7,100,2,25,105,A61K41/0042;;A61K38/168;;A61K47/642;;A61K47/6425;;A61K48/00;;C07K14/415;;C07K14/503;;C07K14/52;;C07K2319/00;;C07K2319/04;;C07K2319/09;;C07K2319/21;;C07K2319/50;;C07K2319/55;;C07K2319/75;;C07K2319/80;;C12N15/62;;C12N15/87,A61K38/16;;A61K41/00;;A61K47/48;;A61K48/00;;C07K14/415;;C07K14/50;;C07K14/52;;C12N15/62;;C12N15/87,,6,2,003-672-991-164-154;;068-894-209-173-299,7806514;;10.1016/s0021-9258(20)30073-9;;10.1021/bc00017a004;;1420437,"DATABASE BIOSIS BIOSCIENCES INFORMATION SERVICE, PHILADELPHIA, PA, US;;CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS, vol. 120, no. 25, 20 June 1994, Columbus, Ohio, US; abstract no. 316874, YANG, YADONG ET AL: ""Cloning of cDNA for human VEGF and its high-efficiency expression in E. coli"";;DATABASE MEDLINE US NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE (NLM), BETHESDA, MD, US;;ANDY J.

The intake valve is configured to have an intake valve closure (IVC) timing. The dual-fuel engine system is configured to operate in a single-fuel mode and a dual-fuel mode. The combustion chamber and a piston are designed to provide a compression ratio. The dual-fuel engine system also includes one or more processors that are operably coupled to and configured to control operation of the first fuel injector. The compression ratio and the IVC timing are selected to achieve a target pre-combustion temperature. The target pre-combustion temperature permits the dual-fuel engine system to operate at a high substitution rate in the dual-fuel mode and at a sufficient fuel efficiency in the single-fuel mode.,GEN ELECTRIC,LAVERTU THOMAS MICHAEL;;PRIMUS ROY JAMES;;GUPTA VENU GUMMADAVELLI;;FREUND SEBASTIAN WALTER;;AKINYEMI OMOWOLEOLA CHUKWUEMEKA;;KLINGBEIL ADAM EDGAR;;SALAZAR VICTOR MANUEL,GE GLOBAL SOURCING LLC (2018-11-01);;GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY (2016-10-31),https://lens.org/134-159-694-794-54X,Granted Patent,yes,26,3,1,1,0,F02M26/47;;F02M26/33;;F02D19/08;;F02M26/47;;F02M26/33;;F02D41/0027;;F02D41/38;;F02D41/005;;F02D2041/389,F02D19/08;;F02D41/00;;F02D41/38;;F02M26/33;;F02M26/47,,2,1,026-193-996-075-43X,10.1016/j.enconman.2011.04.012,"Qian et al., “Research of the influence of combustion chamber structure on performance of dual fuel engine”, Electric Information and Control Engineering (ICEICE), pp. 2498-2500, Apr. 15-17, 2011, Wuhan.;;Carlucci et al., “Combustion and emissions control in diesel—methane dual fuel engines: The effects of methane supply method combined with variable in-cylinder charge bulk motion”, Energy Conversion and Management, vol. 52, Issues: 8-9, pp. 3004-3017, Aug. 2011.",ACTIVE
