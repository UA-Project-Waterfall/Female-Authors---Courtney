GIRLING, Ltd. Nov. 30, 1954 [Dec. 1, 1953], No. 33313/53. Class 103 (1). In a vehicle hand brake of the type which comprises a rod 10, provided with a handle 11 on its outer end, mounted for axial sliding movement in a bracket 15 mounted on the dashboard 17 or other convenient part of the vehicle and adapted for connection at its inner end to a cable or other transmission member leading to the brake, a spring-pressed pivotally-mounted pawl 26 is provided to co-operate with notches 16 in the rod 10 to retain the rod in the brake applied position; the brake being released by turning the rod angularly to free the pawl 26 and bring the smooth portion of the rod into alignment with the pawl so that the rod is free to return to its normal "" off "" position, as shown in Fig. 1. The pawl 26 is pivotally mounted on a transverse pin 27, the axis of which is at right angles to the rod 10, in a sleeve 19 in which the rod 10 is slidably guided and which is retained in the bracket 15 by a resilient sheet-metal plate 20. To apply the brake, the handle 11 is pulled outwards from the ""off "" position shown in Fig. 1 so that the rod 10 moves outwards and the pawl 26 rides over the successive notches 16 in the rod such that when the handle is released the rod is moved inwardly through a small distance by the tension in the transmission line until the pawl has engaged a notch and rocks over to the position shown in Fig. 2. The rod cannot then be released accidentally solely by angular movement of the handle since the sleeve 19 moves with it and the pawl remains in engagement with the associated notch. To release the brake the rod must first be drawn outwards a short distance in the brake-applying direction allowing the notches 22 and 23 in the sleeve 19 to engage lugs 24 and 25 respectively in the housing and so key the sleeve against angular movement. At the same time the pawl is rocked over into an inclined position and the rod can be moved angularly relative to the sleeve to carry the notches 16 out of engagement with the pawl, as shown in Fig. 3, so that on release of the handle, the rod will return to its normal release position as illustrated in Fig. 1.",GIRLING LTD,BONNER DAVID GORDON,,https://lens.org/163-583-376-065-805,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,B60T7/101,B60T7/10,E2A AAMA          AAMA/C;;E2A A106          AAMA/C;;E2A A163          AAMA/C;;E2A A414          AAMA/C;;F2E EMB           EMB;;F2Y YSL           SL;;F2Y Y3122         SL;;U1S S2013,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Detector circuitry then develops a signal which is indicative of the noise level, this signal substantially corresponding to the minimum peak magnitude of the amplified input audio signal. During pauses between audio tones in the input audio signal, this minimum signal magnitude coincides the residual background noise level of the input audio signal. Control circuitry couples the noise level indicative signal to the variable attenuator and constitutes a negative feedback loop for inversely and nonlinearly varying the amplification of the input signal in response to the magnitude of the noise indicative signal. In essence, the signal floor level circuit functions as an AGC circuit where the AGC control voltage is minimum level dependent and also corresponds to the noise floor indicative signal.

Television; transistor monostable circuits. MARCONI CO. Ltd. June 28, 1963 [Aug. 28, 1962], No. 32978/62. Headings H3T and H4F. Television.-The invention relates to a circuit for generating a composite (line and frame) blanking pulse train in response to a composite synchronizing pulse train, the circuit being of particular application where direct access to the system blanking and synchronizing generator unit is not possible, e.g. at a remote point or where signals are obtained from a magnetic tape recorder. The invention is stated to be applicable to the British 405-line system, but is described only as operating with the 525- and 625-line type of synchronizing waveform, Fig. 2 (line IN), where normal line synchronizing pulses SP occur but the frame synchronizing pulses (not shown) are preceded by equalizing pulses EP. The circuit, Fig. 1, consists of four pulse generators A, B, C, and D and a three-input OR gate E which produces an output when any one or more of generators B, C and D produces an output of appropriate polarity. Generator A responds to the composite synchronizing pulse train, and produces an output, A2, in response to only the equalizing pulses. The generator comprises a special transistor monostable circuit (see below) and an AND gate A2 which combines the output of A1 of the transistor circuit with the original synchronizing pulse train to produce the difference A2. The transistor circuit triggers "" ON "" and "" OFF "" in response to the front and back edges respectively of the line synchronizing pulses SP, but only triggers on in response to the equalizing pulses EP and reverts to off in its own time. Generator C is a long pulse generator in the form of a monostable multivibrator which triggers in response to waveform A2 to produce waveform C which determines the frame blanking pulses. Generator B is a monostable multivibrator which responds to each pulse of the composite synchronizing pulse train to produce a pulse train B, the trailing edges of which correspond in time with the trailing edges of the desired line blanking pulses. Generator D is a further monostable multivibrator which responds to the trailing edges of pulse train B and produces pulse D which determine the leading edges of desired blanking pulses. Waveform E comprises the desired composite blanking waveform formed at the output of the OR gate in response to wave forms B, C and D. Transistor monostable circuit.-Transistors 4 and 5, Fig. 1, form a monostable circuit with D.C. coupling in one direction and RC coupling 6, 7 in the other direction, the time constant of which determines the trigger time. The circuit is triggered by the composite synchronizing waveform IN, Fig. 2, which is differentiated in CR circuit 1, 2 to produce waveform 12. The negative-going transients are transmitted by diode 3 to the base of transistor 4 to trigger the circuit "" ON,"" whilst the positive-going transients are by-passed via capacitor 8 so as to be available to trigger the circuit "" OFF."" The waveform at the base of transistor 4 is as shown at 4. With the line synchronizing pulses SP (waveform IN) the transients are effective to trigger the circuit, but with the shorter equalizing pulses EP the transients appear too early on the exponential discharge curve and are ineffective. The circuit then reverts to "" OFF "" in its own time determined by time-constant 6, 7.",MARCONI CO LTD,ILES GORDON DAVID,,https://lens.org/064-773-660-187-015,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H04N5/073,H04N5/073,H3P PPDB          PPDB;;H3T TPST          TPST;;H3T T1M1          -;;H3T T1M2P         -;;H3T T1P6          -;;H3T T2A1N         -;;H3T T2B1          -;;H3T T2B3          -;;H3T T2B4          -;;H3T T2F1          -;;H3T T2F5          -;;H3T T2T3J         -;;H3T T3F1          -;;H3T T3X           -;;H3T T4C           -;;H3T T4M           -;;H4F FD12M         4-;;H4F FD69          4-,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

[Also in Division F2] Apparatus especially for mixing an abrasive solid with a liquid, of the kind comprising a rotatable impeller 2 immersed in the mixture which is drawn in axially and expelled through apertures 4 in a surrounding stator 3, with exertion of shear forces on the mixture and reduction of particle size, has a bearing 16 for the impeller shaft 6 carried in a support 9 depending from the motor housing. At each end of the bearing is a seal 21, 22 comprising a non-rotatable carbon member 23, 26 having a reduced annular bearing surface, and a cooperating member 24, 27 rotating with the shaft. Lubricant is supplied to the bearing and seals from a pressurized reservoir (51, see Fig. 2 not shown) at a pressure at least one atmosphere in excess of the hydrostatic pressure of the liquid by a conduit 56 and is urged by rotation of the shaft along in helical groove 19 in the bearing to a return conduit 59 with cooling of the bearing. A passage 47 with plug 48 enables air to be bled from the system during filling. The seal members are shaped so that they are maintained in contact by the resultant pressure of the lubricant on them as well as by spring 29, ingress of mixture to the sealing and tearing surfaces being prevented by centrifugal force and lubricant pressure. A vent 49 relieves pressure of mixture above the impeller.",SILVERSON MACHINES LTD,LOVE GORDON DAVID,,https://lens.org/154-249-200-987-857,Granted Patent,no,0,3,1,1,0,B01F33/862;;B01F2035/3513,B01F15/00,B1C CAR           CAR;;B1C CX8           -;;B1C C111          CAR;;B1C C18A1         -;;B1C C625          CAR;;B1C C632          CAR;;B1C C642          CAR;;F2A AD36          AD36;;F2A ALEX          ALEX;;F2A A35A1         -;;F2A A35A2         -;;F2A A6E2          AD36;;F2B B13C2E3A      -;;F2B B13C2G3       -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

GIRLING Ltd. June 24, 1958 [July 3, 1957], No. 20962/57. Addition to 724,663. Class 80 (3). [Also in Group XXXIV] In a locking device for a vehicle hand-brake actuating mechanism as claimed in the parent Specification, in which the hand brake is of the straight-pull type in which a spring-pressed detent co-operates with ratchet teeth on an actuating-rod and the brake may be released by moving the rod further in the brake-applying direction such that it takes the detent with it until the detent is clear of an abutment, whereupon the rod can be moved angularly to disengage the ratchet teeth from the detent, the detent for the axially-movable hand brake rod 12 comprises a roller 17 which has its ends guided in aligned recesses 18 mounted on opposite sides of the rod in a housing 10 secured to the vehicle; the recesses 18 being stepped so that the roller remains in the wider ends of the recesses during outward brake-applying movement of the rod 12 riding over the crests of the ratchet teeth 16 on the rod 12 and when the rod is released, with the brake applied, the roller passes into the narrower ends of the recesses and locks the rod against inward movement. There are two rollers 17, shown in Figs. 8, 9 and 10, spaced apart a distance equal to (n+¢) times the spacing between the ratchet teeth of the rod (where n=the number of teeth between the axially-spaced rollers). The rollers are spring-urged towards the teeth by a leaf-spring 20. The angular movement of the rod in the housing is limited by a peg in the housing engaging in an arcuate notch in the rod.",GIRLING LTD,BONNER DAVID GORDON,,https://lens.org/111-103-314-572-404,Granted Patent,no,0,4,1,1,0,G05G5/24,G05G5/24,E2A AAMA          AAMA/C;;E2A A106          AAMA/C;;E2A A164          AAMA/C;;E2A A193          AAMA/C;;E2A A414          AAMA/C;;F2E EMB           EMB;;F2Y YSL           SL;;F2Y Y3129         SL;;U1S S2013,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Estimated deviant voltage levels that the supplied electricity will not drop below or exceed as a result of varying electrical consumption by the one or more electrical devices are continuously computed. The deviant voltage levels may be computed based on a predetermined confidence level and specific properties of the effects on measured voltage due to varying consumption computed from the detected measurements. A voltage level output of the electricity supplied to the electrical device may be adjusted based on the computed deviant voltage level. In an additional implementation, the deviant voltage levels may be based on measurements obtained from each of the three phases in a three-phase electric power distribution system.

Acoustic directional apparatus. NATIONAL RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. May 15, 1957 [May 16, 1956], No. 15215/56. Class 40(7) A directional acoustic pulse-echo locating system comprises a directional or non-directional transmitting transducer and a separate receiving linear-array transducer having a vertical fan beam directivity pattern which is oscillated rapidly in azimuth about a reference axis 15 with an oscillation period not greater than the duration # of each transmitted pulse by coupling the elements of the receiving array to a combining amplifier through respective phase shift elements such that the phase shifts produced are varied electrically at the azimuthal scan frequency; the bearing and range of a reflecting object are indicated by the X and Y co-ordinates of an image spot on a type B cathode-ray tube display whose X and Y timebases are synchronized respectively with the pulse recurrence frequency and the azimuthal scan. As described the phaseshift elements comprise an electrical delay line with a linear phase-shift/frequency characteristic, the transducer elements being coupled to equispaced tappings on the line through respective frequency changers coupled to a common local oscillator whose frequency is varied at the azimuthal scan frequency such that the relative phases of the signals from the transducer elements when combined at one end of the delay line vary cyclically; alternatively the phase-shift elements may comprise thermionic valve reactance elements or inductances with magnetic cores whose permeability is varied by a D.C. polarising current. Also as described the azimuthal scan period is equal to the pulse duration # but it may be a submutiple of said duration. The invention is applicable to terrestrial, subterranian and subsqueous locating systems (e.g. fish location) and to locating flaws in solid objects. In one embodiment, Fig. 1, utilizing a double beam C.R.T. an output is taken from each end of the delay line, the two outputs corresponding respectively to two fan beams B1, B2, Fig. lb, oscillating symmetrically with respect to the axis 15 between the directions 15, 15a and 15, 15b respectively and in a second embodiment, Fig. 8, utilizing a single beam C.R.T. a single output is taken from one end of the delay line corresponding to a single beam oscillating symmetrically about the axis 15. A shown in Fig. 1 a 1 c/s. pulse generator 10 is coupled to the transmitting transducer 11 and to a range timebase generator 9 whose output is applied to a single set of Y deflection plates 24 of the double-beam C.R.T., a sawtooth bearing timebase of recurrence period equal to the pulse duration being applied from a generator 27 to the two sets of X deflection plates 23a, 23b thereby causing the two cathode-ray beams to scan symmetrically outwards from the centre line 28 of the screen. The receiving transducer array comprises five contiguous elements 12a ... 12e each having a directivity pattern (a), Fig. 15, the diffraction pattern due to the spacing of the elements being shown by the curve (b). The signal of frequency q=50 kc./s. received by each element of the array, e.g. element 12a, is applied in phase quadrature to a respective pair of balanced ring modulators 18a, 19a, Fig. 2 (not shown), together with phase quadrature components of a common local oscillation of frequency p varying synchronously with the bearing timebase between the limits 3 q/2=75 kc./s. and (1+k)q(=150 kc./s. when k=2), Fig. 5 (not shown), and derived, Fig. 3 (not shown), by heterodyning a 3À525 mc/s. fixed oscillation with phase quadrature outputs from an oscillator whose frequency is varied cyclically between 3À6 and 3À675 mc/s. by the bearing timebase voltage. The outputs from the modulators 18a, 19a are combined to give a resultant signal whose frequency (p-q) varies cyclically between the limits q/2 and kq and whose phase is determined by the phase of the signal received by the transducer element 12a. The amplitudes of the local inputs to the modulators 18a, 19a are controlled in units 21a, 21b, Fig. 2 (not shown), by an inverted sawtooth signal from the range timebase 9 to maintain a constant amplitude ratio between the received and local input signals to the modulators. According to the Provisional Specification spurious outputs from the frequency changers due to third order modulation may be avoided by using a local oscillation having a square waveform as shown in Fig. 8 (Prov.). The resultant output from each pair of modulators is applied to a respective tapping on a lowpass delay line 13, Fig. 4 (not shown), having a linear positive phase-shift/frequency characteristic, Fig. 7 (not shown) and it is shown that when the total phase shift of the line at the frequency q is 2# then the output from the right-hand end of the delay line corresponds to the signal received by a beam Bl, Fig. 16, scanning between the directions 15 and 15a and the output from the left-hand end of the line corresponds to the signal received by a beam B2 scanning between the directions 15 and 15b, the angular width of the scan sector bounded by the directions 15a and 15b being 2 k# where is the horizontal beam width of each beam B1 and B2. The left- and right-hand outputs are applied through respective detectors and amplifiers 14a, 25a and 14b, 25b to intensity modulate the cathode-ray beams scanning the right and left halves of the C.R.T. screen. A target on the axis 15 will produce a signal at each end of the delay line 13 at the beginning of each bearing sweep and in order to prevent an excessive response under these conditions the gain of the amplifiers 14a and 14b is reduced between the frequencies q and q/2, Fig. 6 (not shown). In order to minimise the effect of the second order maximum lobes of the array diffraction pattern (b), Fig. 15, the scan angle 2 k# should not exceed n# where n is the number of elements in the array. The effect of side lobes is also reduced by making the transmitting transducer 11 directional and such a transducer may comprise a strip array of elements with an energization (1+2 cos x#) where x is the distance from the centre of the array and is unity at the ends of the array. In the second embodiment, Fig. 8, comprising a single beam C.R.T., the bearing timebase is applied to a single pair of X deflection plates. Each frequency changer, Fig. 10 (not shown), connected between an element of the receiving transducer array 12 and a corresponding tapping on a delay line 30 comprises a first transformerless modulator 31a supplied with a fixed frequency S=1À05 mc/s. from a common oscillator 32, the resultant difference frequency S-q=1 mc/s. being selected by a filter 33a and applied to a similar modulator 34a together with the output from a common oscillator 35, Fig. 10 (not shown), whose frequency p is varied cyclically between 3À165 and 3À675 mc/s. by an output from the bearing timebase generator 27; the resultant difference frequency p+q-S which varies, Fig. 12 (not shown), between 2À165 and 2À675 mc/s. is selected by a filter 36a. In order to avoid distortion of the signal the frequency sweep should be greater than n/#. The delay line 30, Fig. 11 (not shown), is of the band-pass type with a phase-shift varying linearly from negative through zero to positive over the pass-band such that the output from one end of the line corresponds to the signal received by a beam oscillating symmetrically about the axis 15 and this output is applied to intensity modulate the cathode-ray beam. The relative amplitudes of the inputs to the delay line 30 are adjusted by variable gain amplifiers, Fig. 9 (not shown), interposed between the filters 33 and second modulators 34 to compensate for the attenuation in the line. Suitable component values are given for the delay lines 13, 30, the units 21a, 21b, Fig. 1, and the units 31-36, Fig. 8. The type of frequency changer used in the second embodiment may be employed in the first embodiment and vice-versa.",NAT RES DEV,TUCKER DAVID GORDON,,https://lens.org/039-333-488-731-203,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,G01S15/42,G01S15/42,G1G GER           ER;;G1G G1A           ER;;G1G G4A4          ER;;G1G G5A3A         ER;;G1G G7F           ER;;G1G G7P           ER;;G1G G7T           ER,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Washing floors etc.; reservoir brushes. UNITED KINGDOM ATOMIC ENERGY AUTHORITY. Oct. 21, 1957 [July 30, 1956], No. 23524/56. Classes 19 and 138(1). A washing device comprises a hollow head portion 1 having an inlet for cleansing liquid, a skirt 3 of resilient flexible substance extending from the head portion to make contact with the surface being cleaned and to contain the cleansing liquid delivered by the inlet, and an outlet 4 to which suction means can be attached to draw up soiled cleansing liquid to reduce the air-pressure in the hollow head portion 1 and over the surface being cleaned. In one form on an inlet manifold 2 having rubber end-pieces 11 are spaced stub tubes 19 from each of which hangs a rubber tube 5. The skirt 3 is a rubber wiper blade and has ribs 10, studs or dimples. Through the skirts 3 and plates 8 and the brass head portion 1 pass spaced bolts 6 each carrying a nut and a spacer sleeve 9. In a second form the head portion carries a copper pipe 2 soldered to a brass block 12 with inlet holes 13. Bolts 6 each pass through plates 14 as well as rubber wiper blades 15 having ribs 16. Bristles 17 are bunched to form brushes in holes in the block 12. A cylindrical brush may be provided in the head portion rotated by a motor carried thereby. The suction means, e.g. an exhauster driven by a motor, may be carried on a trolley, also carrying a large cyclone interceptor for trapping soiled cleansing liquid, fresh liquid, e.g. in a tank, being drawn through a valve to the device by a pump driven by the same motor.",ATOMIC ENERGY AUTHORITY UK,STEVENSON DAVID GORDON,,https://lens.org/158-034-545-894-370,Granted Patent,no,0,4,1,1,0,A47L11/4088;;A47L11/30;;A47L11/302;;A47L11/4036;;A47L11/4044;;A47L11/4077,A47L11/30,A4K KBA           KBA;;A4K K153          KBA;;A4K K158          KBA;;A4K K161          KBA;;A4K K164          KBA;;A4K K191          KBA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The proxy DMA unit is provided with check summing circuitry which calculates a check sum for the data transferred between system memory and an external peripheral device. The check sum is subsequently used by the computer system to validate the data when it is read back to the system memory via the proxy DMA unit thus generating a second check sum. If the two check sums are the same the data is uncorrupted whereas if they are different the data is corrupted and remedial procedures can be initiated.

The present invention requires reading an old data block from a storage unit and an old redundancy data block from the SSD, then combining the old data block, a new data block, and the old redundancy data block to generate a new redundancy data block, and thereafter writing the new data block to a storage unit and the new redundancy data block to the SSD. However, reading the old redundancy data block from the SSD and writing the new redundancy data block to the SSD at electronic speeds takes a negligible amount of time compared to the Read and Write times of a typical rotating disk storage unit. While the storage unit on which a new data block will be stored is involved for the duration of each data modification operation, the involvement of the SSD in the operation ceases upon writing the new redundancy data block.

Transistor pulse frequency dividing circuits. MARCONI CO. Ltd Nov. 5, 1963 [Jan. 28, 1963], No. 3361/63. Heading H3T. A pulse frequency divider comprises two capacitors 1, 2 and a rectifier diode 3 connected in series as shown across input terminals, a transistor 4 having its base-emitter circuit connected across the diode 3 and a bi-stable circuit comprising two reciprocally coupled transistors 5, 6 of opposite conductivity types, the bi-stable circuit being connected across the capacitor 2 and being triggered thereby when the staircase voltage waveform developed across the capacitor reaches a predetermined value to provide an output pulse at the collector of transistor 6. Each input pulse of amplitude +V places a predetermined value of charge on each of capacitors 1 and 2, the transistor 4 being rendered conductive at the termination of the pulse to charge capacitor 1 to the voltage level already established on capacitor 2. The voltage on capacitor 2 thus builds up by equal increments for each applied pulse until the voltage thereacross momentarily exceeds the value +V whereupon the bi-stable circuit 5, 6 is triggered and the capacitor 2 is discharged so that the cycle may repeat. Triggering of the bistable pulse develops a pulse of amplitude -V at the collector of transistor 6. In Fig. 3 (not shown) the circuit of Fig. 1 is followed by a similar but inverted circuit using transistors of the complementary conductivity type as the input thereto consists of pulses of amplitude -V. Fig. 4 (not shown) shows a circuit similar to that of Fig. 3, but in which a silicon diode is connected in series in the emitter circuits of each transistor 5 to prevent reverse-voltage breakdown and in which the collectors of the transistors 6 are returned to points on potential dividers connected across the supply to ensure positive triggering of the bi-stable circuits without the necessity for saturation in the transistors 4.",MARCONI CO LTD,ILES GORDON DAVID,,https://lens.org/108-112-344-741-690,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,H03K25/00,H03K25/00,H3P PLSS          PLSS,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The delivery vector may also be attenuated, non-pathogenic, low pathogenic, or a probiotic bacterium. The chimeric proteins include chimeras of, e.g., phage coat and/or colicin proteins, bacterial toxins and/or enzymes, autotransporter peptides, lytic peptides, multimerization domains, and/or membrane transducing (ferry) peptides. The active portion of the immunogenic chimeric proteins can include antigens against a wide range of parasites and infectious agents, cancers, Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases, and have enhanced activity when secreted or released by the bacteria, and/or have direct anti-parasite or infectious agent activity. The activity of the secreted proteins is further increased by co-expression of a protease inhibitor that prevents degradation of the effector peptides. Addition of an antibody binding or antibody-degrading protein further prevents the premature elimination of the vector and enhances the immune response.",BERMUDES DAVID GORDON,BERMUDES DAVID GORDON,,https://lens.org/175-338-442-412-366,Granted Patent,yes,104,15,4,4,51,A61K35/74;;A61K35/74;;A61K38/00;;A61K38/00;;A61K39/0208;;A61K39/07;;A61K39/12;;A61K39/12;;A61K39/145;;A61K2039/522;;A61K2039/522;;A61K2039/523;;A61K2039/523;;A61K2039/542;;A61K2039/542;;C12N15/74;;C12N15/74;;C07K14/005;;C07K14/47;;C07K14/81;;C07K14/81;;C07K14/811;;C07K2319/02;;C07K2319/33;;C07K2319/40;;C07K2319/50;;C07K2319/55;;C12N2760/16134;;C12N2760/16134;;Y02A50/30,C07K14/81;;A61K35/74;;A61K39/00;;A61K39/02;;A61K39/07;;C12N15/00;;C12N15/62,,51,42,062-178-056-900-874;;101-983-598-782-23X;;063-504-244-445-861;;058-110-913-500-563;;029-524-730-642-508;;134-792-057-776-975;;117-003-971-677-505;;016-818-315-124-561;;042-264-210-686-198;;008-257-422-933-244;;010-458-329-988-50X;;058-670-613-139-863;;101-983-598-782-23X;;016-663-238-364-92X;;087-688-317-341-722;;056-549-171-572-522;;160-475-196-827-81X;;024-206-015-299-565;;093-565-125-293-233;;052-177-655-221-93X;;013-585-438-821-515;;074-603-194-901-605;;004-774-097-289-474;;044-933-241-505-220;;040-585-201-588-144;;020-226-085-485-104;;063-504-244-445-861;;085-800-424-766-43X;;062-178-056-900-874;;008-996-941-604-126;;001-952-927-098-897;;024-285-866-551-958;;064-060-844-798-769;;058-110-913-500-563;;040-238-365-390-402;;132-093-447-868-677;;034-911-349-161-976;;051-821-362-073-206;;018-964-123-967-415;;038-677-027-890-845;;005-511-569-293-28X;;015-281-735-692-107,12598644;;pmc151414;;10.1073/pnas.0538072100;;10.1128/aem.56.3.823-825.1990;;pmc183429;;16348153;;10.1021/jf00094a051;;8898333;;10.1016/0166-6851(96)02703-x;;10.1073/pnas.94.24.13128;;pmc24274;;9371811;;17336999;;10.1016/j.jinsphys.2006.12.015;;10.1016/0006-291x(90)91023-l;;2306254;;10.1007/s00262-006-0162-6;;16636812;;2680606;;10.1016/0014-5793(89)81785-5;;15499377;;10.1038/sj.cgt.7700779;;pmc7110110;;10.1111/j.1745-7270.2008.00470.x;;10.1093/abbs/40.10.848;;18850049;;10.1074/jbc.m212996200;;12621047;;10.1128/aem.56.3.823-825.1990;;pmc183429;;16348153;;10.1007/bf01092199;;23835175;;10.1128/aem.01854-13;;pmc3754169;;10.1080/02648725.2001.10648014;;11530689;;9377566;;pmc1138787;;10.1042/bj2610099;;2549968;;18594008;;10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-07-4800;;18158158;;10.1016/j.jip.2007.11.004;;10837181;;10.1086/315497;;11544217;;pmc95446;;10.1128/jb.183.19.5554-5561.2001;;10.1074/jbc.m010170200;;11278631;;10772643;;10.1172/jci9818;;pmc300839;;pmc3688533;;10.1371/journal.pntd.0002263;;23818995;;0006996568;;6996568;;10.1146/annurev.bi.49.070180.003113;;10.1021/jf00094a051;;23771044;;10.3390/md11062069;;pmc3721222;;12598644;;pmc151414;;10.1073/pnas.0538072100;;23145203;;10.1371/journal.pntd.0001900;;pmc3493396;;10.1128/aem.58.2.525-531.1992;;1610177;;pmc195279;;2200522;;10.1016/0167-4781(90)90098-m;;25340556;;10.3390/toxins6103005;;pmc4210883;;8898333;;10.1016/0166-6851(96)02703-x;;pmc2064865;;11773163;;10.1200/jco.2002.20.1.142;;10.1200/jco.20.1.142;;10.1158/0008-5472.can-12-4719;;23832662;;pmc3804125;;10.1158/0008-5472.can-13-1274;;23832663;;pmc3153225;;10.3390/toxins2050935;;22069618;;8814783;;10.1016/0965-1748(95)00102-6;;10.1002/(sici)1520-6327(199909)42:1<1::aid-arch2>3.0.co;2-;;10.1002/(sici)1520-6327(199909)42:1<1::aid-arch2>3.0.co;2-#;;10467052;;21268232;;10.1002/ps.2099;;16391085;;pmc1352293;;10.1128/aem.72.1.506-515.2006,"Wei et al, PNAS 100(5):2760-2765, 2003.;;Honee et al, Appl.

The armature voltage is supplied from a power source via one of many taps of a regulating transformer. The armature voltage being supplied from the power source to the machine is changed by selecting one of the voltage levels from the taps of the regulating transformer. The tap voltage levels are selected based on the determined applied armature voltage to minimize power consumption of the machine while ensuring based on a predetermined confidence level that the pull-out torque of the machine will not be exceeded.,PROGRAMMABLE CONTROL SERVICES,BELL DAVID GORDON,UTILIDATA INC (2012-01-31);;PROGRAMMABLE CONTROL SERVICES INC (2010-02-17),https://lens.org/170-343-156-499-282,Patent Application,yes,3,8,6,15,0,H02J3/00;;H02P2205/03;;H02P2207/05;;H02P23/0004;;H02P25/024;;Y04S20/222;;Y02B70/3225;;H02J3/00;;H02P2205/03;;H02P2207/05;;H02P25/024;;H02P23/0004,H02P1/46;;H02P23/02;;H02P27/02,318/720,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

   An electronic game for multiple, preferably two, players requires that the players act independently and cooperatively at different points in the game in order to complete the game. Different modes of cooperation are provided within the context of the game story and include, for example, holding a door for a player, handing a tool to a player, giving an item to a player, helping a player lift an object, etc. The cooperation required by the game includes requiring the result that only both players can complete the game together; neither player can complete the game without the other. A split-screen mode and a single-screen mode are utilized to enhance the difference between independent action and cooperative action. When players are cooperating, generally a single-screen mode is used and when players are acting independently, generally a split-screen mode is used. The game is preferably embodied in a medium readable by a personal computer such as a CDROM or DVD. However, the game may be embodied in any of several types of electronic game formats such as video game cartridges, dedicated hardware device, etc.

The combined treatment gives brightnesses comparable with those achieved with stabilized alkaline hydrogen peroxide. By comparison the reaction of di-oxygen and alkali alone darkens high-yield pulps; and treatment with alkaline borohydride in the absence of added di-oxygen bleaches to give only about half the brightness gained if di-oxygen is added. The bleaching may possibly occur through the conversion of di-oxygen molecules (O.sub.2) to hydroperoxide ions (HOO-) utilizing ionized phenolic groups or hydroquinones in the lignin. The hydroperoxide ions are thus generated in situ in the lignin and can destroy colored lignin chromophores. Without the addition of borohydride the lignin phenolic groups would be irreversibly oxidized. The primary role of the borohydride is to regenerate the phenolic groups and maintain a di-oxygen hydroperoxide (O.sub.2)(HOO-) cycle. In a secondary role, the borohydride also contributes to the bleaching by reducing radicals, organic peroxides and carbonyl compounds in the pulps.",PULP PAPER RES INST,LEARY GORDON;;GIAMPAOLO DAVID,,https://lens.org/166-315-307-120-813,Granted Patent,yes,7,6,2,2,0,D21C9/1084;;D21C9/147;;D21C9/163;;D21C9/1084;;D21C9/163;;D21C9/147,D21C9/10;;D21C9/147;;D21C9/16,162/65;;162/78;;162/80,11,3,010-085-983-987-051;;017-099-790-672-426;;122-432-018-765-670,10.3183/npprj-1990-05-03-p148-154;;10.1007/bf00350692;;10.1039/j39670000611,"D.H.

The valve I controls the quantity of water in the tank 3 between a predetermined upper level 9a and a 5 predetermined lower level 9b. The valve I has an inlet 2b and an outlet 1 interconnected by a restricted passage 16 controlled by a diaphragm 14. The restricted passage 16 is formed by a bore 16b and a reciprocally operative rod 23 is mounted in the bore 16b. The rod 23 is connected to a support lever 12 which is biased, by spring 27 to tend to close the valve I. The support lever 12 has an operating weight element 7 suspended therefrom by a depending cord 10 8. The operating weight 7 is of two sections, 7a and 7b, having a combined weight providing for substantially neutral buoyancy in the water. The length of the cord 8 between the support lever 12 the lower operating weight sections 7b determines the lower water level threshold 9b. The length of the cord 8 between the two weight sections 7a and 7b determines the differential between the lower level 9b and upper level 9a. In other words the length of the cord 8 15 between the lever 12 and the upper weight section 7a determines the upper water level 9a. When the quantity of water in the tank 3 falls below the lower threshold level 9b both sections 7a and 7b of the weight element 7 are supported by lever 12 overcoming the bias of spring 27 thereon and opening the valve 1. As the water level rises the support lever 12 the lower weight section 7b is buoyed up thereby but this is insufficient to enable the spring 27 to close 20 the valve 1.

The combined treatment gives brightnesses comparable with those achieved with stabilised alkaline hydrogen peroxide. By comparison the reaction of di-oxygen and alkali alone darkens high-yield pulps; and treatment with alkaline borohydride in the absence of added di-oxygen bleaches to give only about half the brightness gained if di-oxygen is added. The bleaching may possibly occur through the conversion of di-oxygen molecules (O2) to hydroperoxide ions (HOO-) utilising ionised phenolic groups or hydroquinones in the lignin. The hydroperoxide ions are thus generated in situ in the lignin and can destroy coloured lignin chromophores. Without the addition of borohydride the lignin phenolic groups would be irreversibly oxidised. The primary role of the borohydride is to regenerate the phenolic groups and maintain a di-oxygen hydroperoxide (O2) (HOO-) cycle. In a secondary role, the borohydride also contributes to the bleaching by reducing radicals, organic peroxides and carbonyl compounds in the pulps.",,LEARY GORDON;;GIAMPAOLO DAVID,,https://lens.org/188-106-029-474-298,Patent Application,no,0,4,2,2,0,D21C9/1084;;D21C9/147;;D21C9/163;;D21C9/1084;;D21C9/163;;D21C9/147,D21C9/10;;D21C9/147;;D21C9/16,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   A method for detecting specific DNA sequences and discriminating single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide probes is disclosed. Oligonucleotide probes are labelled with a reporter molecule preferentially attached to an internal nucleotide residue. The fluorescence emission of oligonucleotide probes varies significantly when in single-stranded and double-stranded states despite the absence of quencher moieties, allowing reliable detection of complementary DNA targets. The melting temperature of probe/target duplexes permits discrimination of targets that differ by as little as a single nucleotide residue, such that polymorphic targets may be discriminated by fluorescence quantitation and Tm. The hybridisation probes of this invention have been demonstrated to accurately identify homozygous and heterozygous samples using a single fluorescent oligonucleotide and direct investigation of saliva with hybridisation probes permits ultra-rapid genotypic analysis within 35-40 minutes. Target detection and SNP discrimination assays have been achieved in homogeneous, heterogeneous, real-time and solid-phase formats.
