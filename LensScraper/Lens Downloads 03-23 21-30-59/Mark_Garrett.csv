The spatial light modulator includes photoresponsive layers of amorphous silicon and light modulating layers of ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLCs). The present invention is particularly charactierized in that the problems due to large capacitances of thin layers of the amorphous silicon and FLC are overcome by preventing excessive spurious signals from being applied to the light modulating layer. This is accomplished by combining thin light modulating with thick photoresponsive layers, using asymmetric driving waveforms, using slow driving waveforms combined with conductive light modulators, and by using suitable materials constants such as high polarization or high dielectric constant FLCs. According to such arrangements, the characteristic response time of the light modulator for a reversal of an applied electric field polarity is substantially shorter than its characteristic response time caused by the removal of an applied electric field. Also, the present invention has the benefit that when the state of the electrical driver is changed from a first state to a second state so as to switch the light modulator from a first optical state to a second optical state, charges are prevented from accumulating on the light modulator so as to prevent spurious signals.",MODDEL GARRETT;;HANDSCHY MARK A,MODDEL GARRETT;;HANDSCHY MARK A,,https://lens.org/194-948-510-400-576,Granted Patent,yes,12,30,1,1,0,G02F1/135;;G02F1/141;;G02F1/135;;G02F1/141,G02F1/135;;G02F1/141,359/85;;359/62;;359/72;;359/104,11,7,024-500-917-750-121;;102-180-754-094-031;;005-952-840-860-397;;047-819-585-778-476;;104-436-539-553-580;;036-029-562-639-363;;047-819-585-778-476,10.1063/1.334487;;10.1117/12.946920;;10.1364/ao.26.000241;;20454119;;10.1364/ao.27.001797;;20531655;;10.1557/proc-118-405;;10.1088/0022-3727/21/10s/045;;10.1364/ao.27.001797;;20531655,"U.

The first Mach-Zehnder type interferometer in the series is responsive to the sinusoidal electrical modulation signal being applied, to generate a series of optical pulses having controllable chirp. Each successive Mach-Zehnder interferometer is responsive to the sinusoidal electrical modulation signal being applied, to shape the series of optical pulses that are input to it from the previous Mach-Zehnder type interferometer, and produce an output train of optical pulses having a duty cycle that is dependant on the waveform of the electrical modulation signal being applied to at least one of the Mach-Zehnder type interferometers.

    An optical reading system is described herein which can be used to detect the presence of a biological substance (e.g., cell, drug, chemical compound) on a surface of a grating-based waveguide sensor. In one embodiment, the reading system includes a light source (e.g., laser, diode) for directing a light beam into the grating-based waveguide sensor and a detector (e.g., spectrometer, CCD imaging device) for receiving a reflected light beam from the grating-based waveguide sensor and analyzing the reflected light beam so as to detect a resonant wavelength/angle which corresponds to a predetermined refractive index that indicates whether a biological substance is located on the surface of the grating-based waveguide sensor. The grating-based waveguide sensor is tuned to have a resonant wavelength/angle at a predetermined spectral location by adjusting a skew angle defined as an angle between a plane of incidence of the light beam directed into the grating-based waveguide sensor and a grating vector which is perpendicular to the lines of a diffraction grating within the grating-based waveguide sensor. In another embodiment, the reading system is capable of performing a multiplexed interrogation of an array of grating-based waveguide sensors.

In one embodiment, the reading system includes a light source (122) (e.g., laser, diode) for directing a light beam (126) into the grating-based waveguide sensor and a detector (124) (e.g., spectrometer, CCD imaging device) for receiving a reflected light beam (128) from the grating-based waveguide sensor and analyzing the reflected light beam so as to detect a resonant wavelength/angle which corresponds to a predetermined refractive index that indicates whether a biological substance is located on the surface of the grating-based waveguide sensor. The grating-based waveguide sensor is tuned to have a resonance at a predetermined wavelength/angle by adjusting a skew angle defined as an angle between a plane of incidence of the light beam directed into the grating-based waveguide sensor and a grating vector which is perpendicular to the lines of a diffraction grating within the grating-based waveguide sensor. In another embodiment, the reading system is arranged to perform a multiplexed interrogation of an array of grating-based waveguide sensors.",CORNING INC;;PIECH GARRETT A;;KROL MARK F,PIECH GARRETT A;;KROL MARK F,,https://lens.org/166-182-000-670-216,Patent Application,yes,3,12,4,4,0,G01N21/7743;;G01N21/7743;;G01N21/431;;G01N21/431,G01N21/43;;G01N21/77,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The high creep resistance plastic material is oriented during the injection molding process around the entire circumference of the support ring, to provide sufficient strength to withstand the radial forces from the clamping ring.",CONTINENTAL AUTOMOTIVE SYSTEMS INC,JERISK JOSEPH G;;PNIEWSKI GARRETT MARK;;MAKKAR SUNNY,CONTINENTAL AUTOMOTIVE SYSTEMS INC (2018-01-22),https://lens.org/015-998-905-985-18X,Granted Patent,yes,10,2,5,5,0,B60G11/27;;B29C45/16;;B29C45/16;;B29K2077/00;;B29K2995/0083;;B29L2031/721;;B29L2031/721;;B60G11/27;;B60G11/27;;B60G11/28;;B60G2202/152;;B60G2202/152;;B60G2202/152;;B60G2206/424;;B60G2206/424;;B60G2206/7104;;B60G2206/7104;;B60G2206/81012;;B60G2206/81012;;B60G2800/162;;B60G2800/162;;F16F9/0463;;F16F9/0454;;F16F9/0454;;F16F9/05;;F16F9/05;;F16F9/38;;F16F2224/02;;F16F2226/04,F16F9/36;;B29C45/16;;B29K77/00;;B29L31/00;;B60G11/27;;F16F9/04;;F16F9/05;;F16F9/38,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

    This invention provides an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope comprising a fiber-coupled, angled-dual-axis confocal head and a vertical scanning unit. The angled-dual-axis confocal head is configured such that an illumination beam and an observation beam intersect optimally at an angle within an object. The vertical scanning unit causes the angled-dual-axis confocal head to move towards or away from the object, thereby yielding a vertical scan that deepens into the object, while keeping the optical path lengths of the illumination and observation beams unchanged so to ensure the optimal intersection of the illumination and observation beams in the course of vertical scanning. The angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope may further comprises a transverse stage, causing the object to move relative to the angled-dual-axis confocal head along transverse directions perpendicular to the vertical direction, thereby producing a transverse scan. By assembling various transverse and/or vertical scans in a suitable manner, two-dimensional transverse and/or vertical cross-section images of the object can be obtained. A three-dimensional volume image of the object can be accordingly constructed. The angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope of the present invention provides a versatile and high resolution imaging tool, well suited for tissue and other biological imaging applications. Moreover, by employing relatively low numerical aperture focusing elements, fiber-optic components and a fiber-coupled laser, the present invention provides an assembly of fiber-based angled-dual-axis confocal systems that can be particularly powerful tools for performing low noise confocal scanning microscopy in a scattering medium.

The angled-dual-axis confocal head is configured such that an illumination beam and an observation beam intersect optimally at an angle υ within an object. The vertical scanning unit causes the angled-dual-axis confocal head to move towards or away from the object, thereby yielding a vertical scan that deepens into the object, while keeping the optical path lengths of the illumination and observation beams unchanged so to ensure the optimal intersection of the illumination and observation beams in the course of vertical scanning. The angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope may further comprises a transverse stage, causing the object to move relative to the angled-dual-axis confocal head along transverse directions perpendicular to the vertical direction, thereby producing a transverse scan. By assembling various transverse and/or vertical scans in a suitable manner, two-dimensional transverse and/or vertical cross-section images of the object can be obtained. A three-dimensional volume image of the object can be accordingly constructed. The angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope of the present invention provides a versatile and high resolution imaging tool, well suited for tissue and other biological imaging applications.

   A wireless receiver including a receive chain, a synchronization processor, a memory, a combiner and a soft decision processor. The synchronization processor determines a frequency response of the wireless channel using synchronization data transmitted in the wireless channel. The memory stores a compensation vector indicative of a frequency response of receive chain filtering. The combiner combines the compensation vector with the wireless channel frequency response to provide a compensated frequency response. The soft decision processor uses the compensated frequency response to evaluate data decisions. The compensation vector is based on measurement or estimation of the frequency response of the receive chain. The combiner may be based on multiplication or addition. The wireless receiver may include an FEQ. The synchronization processor generates FEQ coefficients for programming the FEQ taps. The FEQ provides an equalized data value and a compensated frequency response value to the soft decision processor for each sub-carrier.

    This invention provides an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope comprising a fiber-coupled, angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head and a vertical scanning unit. The angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head is configured such that an illumination beam and an observation beam intersect optimally at an angle within an object and the scanning is achieved by pivoting the illumination and observation beams using a single scanning element, thereby producing an arc-line scan. The vertical scanning unit causes the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head to move towards or away from the object. By integrating the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope of the present invention with fiber-optic components and a fiber-coupled laser, the present invention also provides an assembly of fiber-based angled-dual-axis confocal scanning systems that can be particularly powerful tools in biological and medical imaging applications, such as instruments for performing optical coherence microscopy and in vivo optical biopsies.

    This invention provides an angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope comprising a fiber-coupled, high-speed angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head and a vertical scanning unit. The angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head is configured such that an illumination beam and an observation beam intersect optimally at an angle within an object and the scanning is achieved by pivoting the illumination and observation beams jointly using a high-speed scanning element, thereby producing an arc-line scan. The vertical scanning unit causes the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head to move towards or away from the object. Optical coherence detection is employed to provide temporal gating, thus detecting mostly single-scattered light and preventing multiple-scattered light from dominating the signal when imaging in a scattering medium. By incorporating MEMS scanning mirrors and fiber-optic components, the angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope can be miniaturized to provide a particularly powerful tool for in vivo medical imaging applications.

   This invention provides an angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope comprising a fiber-coupled, high-speed angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head and a vertical scanning unit. The angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head is configured such that an illumination beam and an observation beam intersect optimally at an angle within an object and the scanning is achieved by pivoting the illumination and observation beams jointly using a high-speed scanning element. The vertical scanning unit causes the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head to move towards or away from the object, thereby yielding a vertical cross-section scan of the object, while keeping the optical path lengths of the illumination and observation beams unchanged. By incorporating MEMS scanning mirrors and fiber-optic components, the angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope of the present invention can be miniaturized to provide a particularly powerful tool for in vivo medical imaging applications.

    The present invention provides a novel class of integrated angled-dual-axis confocal scanning endoscopes. An integrated angled-dual-axis confocal scanning endoscope according to the present invention advantageously exploits an angled-dual-axis confocal arrangement in a silicon micro-machined and fiber-coupled construction, rendering it enhanced resolution, faster scanning, higher sensitivity, highly integrated and scalable structure. An integrated angled-dual-axis confocal scanning endoscope thus constructed can be readily miniaturized for many applications, such as in vivo imaging of biological specimens. One or two illumination beams may be employed in an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning endoscope of the present invention, thereby providing an assortment of reflectance and fluorescence images. An angled-dual-axis confocal scanning endoscope of the present invention is further capable of providing various line and cross-sectional-surface scans with fast speed and high precision. As such, the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning endoscopes of the present invention provide advantages of high-speed and versatile scanning, larger dynamic range of detection, larger field of view and longer working distance, a compact and integrated construction, and versatile imaging capabilities. These novel devices are particularly suitable for biological and medical imaging applications.

    The present invention provides a novel class of integrated angled-dual-axis confocal scanning endoscopes. An integrated angled-dual-axis confocal scanning endoscope according to the present invention advantageously exploits an angled-dual-axis confocal arrangement in a silicon micro-machined and fiber-coupled construction, rendering it enhanced resolution, faster scanning, higher sensitivity, highly integrated and scalable structure. An integrated angled-dual-axis confocal scanning endoscope thus constructed can be readily miniaturized for many applications, such as in vivo imaging of biological specimens. One or two illumination beams may be employed in an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning endoscope of the present invention, thereby providing an assortment of reflectance and fluorescence images. An angled-dual-axis confocal scanning endoscope of the present invention is further capable of providing various line and cross-sectional-surface scans with fast speed and high precision. As such, the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning endoscopes of the present invention provide advantages of high-speed and versatile scanning, larger dynamic range of detection, larger field of view and longer working distance, a compact and integrated construction, and versatile imaging capabilities. These novel devices are particularly suitable for biological and medical imaging applications.

The apparatus preferably includes a single output light source to illuminate a sample with a probe beam and to provide a reference beam. The reference beam is routed into a long arm of an interferometer by a polarizing beamsplitter. A reflected beam is collected from the sample. A 90.degree. double pass polarization rotation element located between the light source and the sample renders the polarizations of the probe beam and reflected beam orthogonal. The polarizing beamsplitter routes the reflected beam into a short arm of the interferometer. The interferometer combines the reference beam and the reflected beam such that coherent interference occurs between the beams. The apparatus ensures that all of the reflected beam contributes to the interference, resulting in a high signal to noise ratio.",OPTICAL BIOPSY TECHNOLOGIES IN,MANDELLA MICHAEL J;;GARRETT MARK H;;KINO GORDON S,OPTICAL BIOPSY TECHNOLOGIES INC (1998-03-12),https://lens.org/181-148-434-018-537,Granted Patent,yes,9,100,5,5,0,A61B3/102;;A61B3/102,A61B5/00,356/491;;356/495;;356/73.1,16,13,097-721-179-514-22X;;011-962-001-560-226;;122-755-472-891-817;;057-068-633-351-521;;141-837-922-753-955;;052-556-080-100-204;;077-040-728-458-277;;037-538-878-743-468;;136-173-834-991-603;;027-936-340-324-465;;051-549-021-036-474;;103-458-263-924-168;;002-220-000-732-701,18079803;;10.1364/ol.24.001358;;10.1109/2944.577331;;10.1364/ol.25.000111;;18059799;;10.1364/ol.24.001221;;18073990;;10.1364/bio.1999.jwa2;;10.1364/ol.24.000531;;18071562;;18087429;;10.1364/ol.23.001060;;20332965;;18084468;;10.1364/ol.23.000228;;10.1364/ol.19.000590;;19844382;;18188315;;10.1364/ol.22.001618;;10.1364/ol.23.000147;;18084441;;10.1109/84.661382;;10.1364/ol.21.000764;;19876151,"Fujimoto, et al., Optical Coherence Tomography, Optics & Photonics News, Jan. 2000, pp. 24-31.;;Rollins et al., Real-time in vivo imaging of human gastrointestinal ultrastructure by use of endoscopic optical coherence tomography with a novel efficient interferometer design, Optics Letters, 24(19), pp. 1358-1360, 1999.;;Izatt, et al., Optical Coherence Tomography and Microscopy in Gastrointestinal Tissues, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics, 2(4), pp. 1017-1028, 1996.;;Drexler, et al., Subcellular optical coherence tomography with a kerr lens mode-locked Ti:Al2O3 laser, Proceedings of the SPIE Conference on Coherence Domain Optical Methods in Biomedical Science and Clinical Applications III, San Jose, California, Jan. 1999, pp. 216-223.;;Wang, et al., High Speed, full field optical coherence microscopy, Proceedings of The SPIE Conference on Coherence Domain Optical Methods in Biomedical Science and Clinical Applications III, San Jose, California, Jan. 1999, pp. 204-212.;;Morgner, et al., Spectroscopic optical coherence tomography, Optics Letters, 25(2), pp. 111-113, 2000.;;Drexler, et al., In vivo ultrahigh-resolution optical coherence tomography, Optics Letters, 21(17), pp. 1221-1223, 1999.;;Bouma, et al., Power-efficient nonreciprocal interferometer and linear-scanning fiber-optic catheter for optical coherence tomography, Optics Letters, 24(8), pp. 531-533, 1999.;;Schmitt, et al., Cross-polarized backscatter in optical coherence tomography of biological tissue, Optics Letters, 23(13), pp. 1060-1062, 1998.;;Park, et al., High resolution optical ranging system, Applied Optics, 20(14), pp. 2389-2394, 1981.;;Everett, M. et al., Birefringence characterization of biological tissue by use of optical coherence tomography, Optics Letter, 23(3), pp. 228-230, 1998.;;Izatt, J. et al., Optical coherence microscopy in scattering media, Optics Letters, 19(8), pp. 590-592, 1994.;;Boppart, S. et al., Forward-imaging instruments for optical coherence tomography, Optics Letters, 22(21), pp. 1618-1620, 1997.;;Podoleanu, A. et al., En-face coherence imaging using galvanometer scanner modulation, Optics Letters, 23(3), pp. 147-149, 1998.;;Dickensheets, D. et al., Silicon micromachined scanning confocal optical microscope, Jrnl.

   This invention provides an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope comprising a fiber-coupled, angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head and a vertical scanning unit. The angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head is configured such that an illumination beam and an observation beam intersect optimally at an angle within an object and the scanning is achieved by pivoting the illumination and observation beams using a single scanning element, thereby producing an arc-line scan. The vertical scanning unit causes the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head to move towards or away from the object. By integrating the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope of the present invention with fiber-optic components and a fiber-coupled laser, the present invention also provides an assembly of fiber-based angled-dual-axis confocal scanning systems that can be particularly powerful tools in biological and medical imaging applications, such as instruments for performing optical coherence microscopy and in vivo optical biopsies.

    This invention provides a method and apparatus for spectral power monitoring by use of a polarization diversity scheme. In the present invention, a multi-wavelength optical signal is first decomposed into first and second polarization components, and the second polarization component is subsequently rotated by 90-degrees, prior to impinging onto a diffraction grating that provides a higher diffraction efficiency for the first polarization component. The diffraction grating separates the first and second polarization components by wavelength respectively into first and second sets of optical beams, impinging onto an array of optical power sensors. The inventive optical spectral power monitoring apparatus thus is able to minimize the insertion loss, while providing enhanced spectral resolution. Further, by modulating the first and second sets of optical beams prior to impinging onto the optical power sensor array, the present invention enables an optical power spectrum associated with each polarization component in the multi-wavelength optical signal to be separately determined.

    This invention provides an angled-dual-illumination-axis confocal scanning microscope comprising a fiber-coupled, angled-dual-illumination-axis confocal scanning head and a vertical scanning unit. The angled-dual-illumination-axis confocal scanning head is configured such that two illumination beams intersect optimally at an angle within an object and the scanning is achieved by pivoting the illumination beams and their corresponding observation beams using a single scanning element, thereby producing an arc-line scan. The vertical scanning unit causes the angled-dual-illumination-axis confocal scanning head to move towards or away from the object, thereby yielding a vertical cross-section scan of the object. The angled-dual-illumination-axis confocal scanning microscope have advantages of enhanced resolution, faster scanning, higher sensitivity and larger dynamic range of detection, a larger field of view and a longer working distance, and a compact and integrated construction.

    This invention provides an angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope comprising a fiber-coupled, high-speed angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head and a vertical scanning unit. The angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head is configured such that an illumination beam and an observation beam intersect optimally at an angle within an object and the scanning is achieved by pivoting the illumination and observation beams jointly using a high-speed scanning element. The vertical scanning unit causes the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head to move towards or away from the object, thereby yielding a vertical cross-section scan of the object, while keeping the optical path lengths of the illumination and observation beams unchanged. By incorporating MEMS scanning mirrors and fiber-optic components, the angled-dual-axis optical coherence scanning microscope of the present invention can be miniaturized to provide a particularly powerful tool for in vivo medical imaging applications.

    This invention provides an angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope comprising a fiber-coupled, angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head and a vertical scanning unit. The angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head is configured such that an illumination beam and an observation beam intersect optimally at an angle within an object and the scanning is achieved by pivoting the illumination and observation beams using a single scanning element, thereby producing an arc-line scan. The vertical scanning unit causes the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning head to move towards or away from the object. By integrating the angled-dual-axis confocal scanning microscope of the present invention with fiber-optic components and a fiber-coupled laser, the present invention also provides an assembly of fiber-based angled-dual-axis confocal scanning systems that can be particularly powerful tools in biological and medical imaging applications, such as instruments for performing optical coherence microscopy and in vivo optical biopsies.

    A system and method for controlling amplification of a signal received by a ZIF radio having a power level within a full power range relative to a minimum noise floor. The ZIF radio includes a ZIF receiver front end, an overload detector, an ADC, a saturation detector, a DC and power estimator, and control logic. The control logic utilized full visibility of the ADC to limit gain of the baseband amplifier to a maximum gain setting sufficient to view the minimum noise floor and to view a received signal having a power level within any of several segments of the power spectrum. The segmentation of the power spectrum is based on an overload condition of the ZIF receiver front end and a saturation condition of the ADC. The control logic further employs limited gain stepping of the baseband amplifier to avoid exceeding a DC budget of the ADC.

The architecture affords hitless switching, near notchless operation, ITU channel alignment, high passband, stability over a broad temperature range, and minimum insertion loss through the optimal coupling efficiency enabled by the feedback control system.",CAPELLA PHOTONICS INC;;DAVIS JOSEPH E;;GARRETT MARK H;;TREMAINE BRIAN;;DARLING MICHAEL,DAVIS JOSEPH E;;GARRETT MARK H;;TREMAINE BRIAN;;DARLING MICHAEL,,https://lens.org/035-202-538-796-377,Patent Application,no,0,0,14,16,0,G02B6/2706;;G02B6/29311;;G02B6/29313;;G02B6/29383;;G02B6/29395;;G02B6/3512;;G02B6/356;;G02B6/3588;;G02B6/3594;;G02B6/356;;G02B6/29383;;G02B6/2706;;G02B6/29311;;G02B6/3512;;G02B6/29313;;G02B6/3594;;G02B6/3588;;G02B6/29395,G02B6/26;;H04B10/27;;H04B10/29;;H04B10/40;;H04B10/43;;H04B10/50;;H04B10/60,,0,0,,,,PENDING

   This invention provides a novel wavelength-separating-routing (WSR) apparatus that uses a diffraction grating to separate a multi-wavelength optical signal by wavelength into multiple spectral channels, which are focused onto an array of corresponding channel micromirrors. The channel micromirrors are individually controllable and continuously pivotable to reflect the spectral channels into selected output ports. As such, the inventive WSR apparatus is capable of routing the spectral channels on a channel-by-channel basis and coupling any spectral channel into any one of the output ports. The WSR apparatus of the invention may further employ a polarization diversity scheme, whereby polarization-sensitive effects become inconsequential and insertion loss is minimized. The WSR apparatus of the invention may additionally be equipped with servo-control and channel equalization capabilities. The WSR apparatus of the invention can be used to construct a novel class of dynamically reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (OADMs) for WDM optical networking applications.

    This invention provides a novel wavelength-separating-routing (WSR) apparatus that uses a diffraction grating to separate a multi-wavelength optical signal by wavelength into multiple spectral channels, which are focused onto an array of corresponding channel micromirrors. The channel micromirrors are individually controllable and continuously pivotable to reflect the spectral channels into selected output ports. As such, the inventive WSR apparatus is capable of routing the spectral channels on a channel-by-channel basis and coupling any spectral channel into any one of the output ports. The WSR apparatus of the invention may further employ a polarization diversity scheme, whereby polarization-sensitive effects become inconsequential and insertion loss is minimized. The WSR apparatus of the invention may additionally be equipped with servo-control and channel equalization capabilities. The WSR apparatus of the invention can be used to construct a novel class of dynamically reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (OADMs) for WDM optical networking applications.

During symbol reading operations, the bar code symbol reading mechanism automatically generates a visible laser scanning pattern for repeatedly reading one or more bar code symbols on an object during a bar code symbol reading cycle, and automatically generating a new symbol character data string in response to each bar code symbol read thereby. During system operation, the user visually aligns the visible laser scanning pattern with a particular bar code symbol on an object (e.g. product, bar code menu, etc.) so that the bar code symbol is scanned, detected and decoded in a cyclical manner. Each time the scanned bar code symbol is successfully read during a bar code symbol reading cycle, a new bar code symbol character string is produced, while an indicator light on the hand-supportable housing is actively driven. During the bar code symbol reading cycle, the user actuates the data transmission switch producing a data transmission control activation signal and enabling a currently or subsequently produced symbol character data string to be automatically selected and transmitted to the host system.
