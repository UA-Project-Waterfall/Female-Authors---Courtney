During the time delay, a temporary display of the trajectory is created, preferably in light gray or another distinguishable color. Each x,y-coordinate position is compared (32) with an immediately preceding coordinate position to determine whether the pen has moved. If so, the new coordinate is stored in a memory (36) which stores a preselected number of the most recent coordinate positions and to a toggle circuit (38) which toggles a preselected bit of the display information stored in the corresponding memory cell of the memory array. After a preselected time, determined by clocking the recent coordinate position memory (36), the oldest stored coordinate position is clocked out and display information in the memory cell corresponding to the clocked out coordinate position is retrieved (42) and analyzed (44).

Such pumps may be particularly useful in pumping fluids that may be damaged by such shear forces (e.g., blood, and particularly heated blood, which is prone to hemolysis) or turbulence (e.g., surfactants or other fluids that may foam or otherwise be damaged or become unstable in the presence of turbulence).",TRACEY BRIAN;;GRAY LARRY B;;DEMERS JASON A;;DALE JAMES D;;PERRY N CHRISTOPHER;;WILT MICHAEL J;;LEONARD SCOTT A;;DEKA PRODUCTS LP,TRACEY BRIAN;;GRAY LARRY B;;DEMERS JASON A;;DALE JAMES D;;PERRY N CHRISTOPHER;;WILT MICHAEL J;;LEONARD SCOTT A,DEKA PRODUCTS LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (2007-06-25),https://lens.org/179-011-161-173-179,Granted Patent,yes,106,202,47,638,0,A61F2007/126;;A61M1/3626;;A61M1/369;;A61M2205/127;;A61M2205/3368;;A61M2205/3606;;A61M2205/3653;;A61M2205/502;;F04B43/0736;;G01K1/08;;G01K1/16;;G01M3/188;;A61M2205/12;;A61M2205/3334;;F04B43/073;;A61M60/113;;A61M60/43;;A61M60/892;;A61M60/894;;G05D7/0682;;Y02A90/10;;A61M60/554;;A61M60/851;;A61M60/36;;A61M60/847;;A61M60/837;;A61M60/849;;A61M1/362227;;A61M1/362265;;A61M1/362263;;A61M1/36225;;F04B43/0081;;F04B43/073;;F04B23/06;;F04B43/0736;;F04B39/123;;F04B53/22;;F04B39/12;;F04B7/02;;F04B53/16;;F04B39/14;;A61M1/1605;;A61M1/16;;A61M1/1656;;A61M1/287;;A61M2205/12;;A61M2205/128;;A61M2205/3317;;A61M2205/3324;;A61M2205/3368;;A61M1/362227;;A61M1/36225;;A61M1/362265;;A61M1/362263,A61M60/113;;F04B49/00;;A61M60/268;;A61M60/36;;A61M60/43;;A61M60/554;;A61M60/837;;A61M60/847;;A61M60/849;;A61M60/851;;F04B43/10;;F04B45/00,417/43;;417/395,55,4,041-783-503-611-702;;065-640-004-670-890;;001-619-920-501-189;;043-144-139-685-028,10.1145/302405.302684;;10.1049/ip-sen:20045061;;10.1109/51.897827;;11211660;;10.1016/0167-6423(87)90035-9,"International Preliminary Report on Patentability mailed Oct. 23, 2008 for Application No. PCT/US2007/009107.;;International Preliminary Report on Patentability mailed Sep. 11, 2009 for Application No. PCT/US2008/055000.;;International Search Report and Written Opinion mailed Aug. 1, 2008 for Application No. PCT/US2008/055000.;;International Preliminary Report on Patentability mailed Sep. 11, 2009 for Application No. PCT/US2008/055168.;;International Search Report and Written Opinion mailed Nov. 10, 2008 for Application No. PCT/US2008/055168.;;Invitation to Pay Additional Fees mailed Aug. 5, 2008 for Application No. PCT/US2008/055168.;;International Preliminary Report on Patentability mailed Apr. 22, 2010 for Application No. PCT/US2008/011663.;;International Search Report and Written Opinion mailed Feb. 20, 2009 for Application No. PCT/US2008/011663.;;Invitation to Pay Additional Fees mailed Nov. 27, 2009 for Application No. PCT/US2009/004866.;;International Search Report and Written Opinion mailed Jan. 27, 2010 for Application No. PCT/US2009/004866.;;Invitation to Pay Additional Fees mailed Dec. 8, 2009 for Application No. PCT/US/2009/004877.;;International Search Report and Written Opinion mailed Feb. 12, 2010 for Application No. PCT/US/2009/004877.;;Office Action for U.S. Appl.

    A stator assembly for a rotary machine having a shroud for a stator vane is disclosed. Various construction details are developed which limit movement of the stator vane into the flowpath by reason of the stator vane being restrained by the shroud. In one particular embodiment, a clip member extends through an opening in the tip of the vane and is disposed at a location adjacent a nonflowpath surface of the shroud to restrain the tip of the vane against inward movement through the shroud.

The speed of a pump stroke can be adjusted by altering a frequency of pressure pulses delivered to the pump membrane during a fill stroke or a delivery stroke of the pump. A pumping algorithm may divide a pump stroke into an initial pumping period and a end-of-stroke pumping period, with the pressure pulse duration being longer during the initial pumping period. This arrangement may allow for a minimum pump flow rate while also providing a pressure ripple that can be used to detect the end of a pump stroke.",DEKA PRODUCTS LP,TRACEY BRIAN D;;GRAY LARRY

The pumps may be configured specifically to impart low shear forces and low turbulence on the fluid as the fluid is pumped from an inlet to an outlet. Such pumps may be particularly useful in pumping fluids that may be damaged by such shear forces (e.g., blood, and particularly heated blood, which is prone to hemolysis) or turbulence (e.g., surfectants or other fluids that may foam or otherwise be damaged or become unstable in the presence of turbulence).",DEKA PRODUCTS LP,TRACEY BRIAN D;;GRAY LARRY B;;DEMERS JASON A;;DALE JAMES D;;PERRY N CHRISTOPHER;;WILT MICHAEL J;;LEONARD SCOTT A,DEKA PRODUCTS LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (2007-06-25),https://lens.org/159-486-972-382-779,Patent Application,yes,2,17,47,638,0,A61F2007/126;;A61M1/3626;;A61M1/369;;A61M2205/127;;A61M2205/3368;;A61M2205/3606;;A61M2205/3653;;A61M2205/502;;F04B43/0736;;G01K1/08;;G01K1/16;;G01M3/188;;A61M2205/12;;A61M2205/3334;;F04B43/073;;A61M60/113;;A61M60/43;;A61M60/892;;A61M60/894;;G05D7/0682;;Y02A90/10;;A61M60/554;;A61M60/851;;A61M60/36;;A61M60/847;;A61M60/837;;A61M60/849;;A61M1/362227;;A61M1/362265;;A61M1/362263;;A61M1/36225;;F04B43/0081;;F04B43/073;;F04B23/06;;F04B43/0736;;F04B39/123;;F04B53/22;;F04B39/12;;F04B7/02;;F04B53/16;;F04B39/14;;A61M1/1605;;A61M1/16;;A61M1/1656;;A61M1/287;;A61M2205/12;;A61M2205/128;;A61M2205/3317;;A61M2205/3324;;A61M2205/3368;;A61M1/362227;;A61M1/36225;;A61M1/362265;;A61M1/362263,F04B43/073;;A61M60/113;;A61M60/268;;A61M60/36;;A61M60/43;;A61M60/554;;A61M60/837;;A61M60/847;;A61M60/849;;A61M60/851;;F04B23/06;;F04B43/00,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The lever may also provide a force on the platen to raise the platen and compress the tube (3210) between a plunger (3091) of the pump and the platen. When the lever is used to hold the door closed it also engages with the carrier to move the slide clamp so that fluid may flow through the tube. When the lever is released it also moves the slide clamp such that it clamps shut the tube and prevents flow through the tube.",DEKA PRODUCTS LP,KAMEN DEAN;;PERET BOB D;;KANE DEREK G;;YOO BRIAN H;;TRACEY BRIAN D;;LANGENFELD CHRISTOPHER C;;LANIGAN RICHARD J;;KERWIN JOHN M;;SLATE MICHAEL J;;GRAY LARRY B;;PLACE MICHAEL S;;LANIER GREGORY R JR;;DURAND KEVIN A;;SMITH STANLEY B III;;MURPHY COLIN H;;SCARPACI JACOB W;;BLUMBERG DAVID JR;;DEMERS JASON A;;BEAVIS RUSSELL H;;CANNAN DAVID D B;;PERRY N CHRISTOPHER;;MANDRO MARC A,,https://lens.org/136-448-781-809-184,Patent Application,no,0,0,26,815,0,A61M5/14216;;A61M5/1452;;A61M5/16809;;A61M5/1684;;A61M5/1689;;A61J3/002;;G01B11/026;;F04C2270/041;;A61M2205/3375;;A61M2205/3306;;A61M2205/18;;A61M5/14216;;A61M5/1452;;A61M5/16809;;A61M5/1684;;A61M5/1689;;A61J3/002;;G01B11/026;;A61M2205/18;;A61M2205/3306;;A61M2205/3375;;G01F22/00;;F04C2270/041,F04B43/12;;A61M1/28;;A61M5/142;;A61M5/145;;A61M5/168,,0,0,,,,PENDING
