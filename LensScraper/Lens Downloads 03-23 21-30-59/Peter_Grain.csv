There are multiple grid based modules meant to teach math concepts from preK thru college level math. There are modules for teaching how to count, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and fraction manipulation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, equivalencies and LCD.) The system provides a physical, and visual model of math and lends itself to self-discovery/self-assistance by the student. The system is attractive to the student because coloring by the student is a part of the learning process, so the student is having fun while learning. This system exceeds the criteria for an ideal math model. These criteria are discussed in the definitive article (Murata, Aki (2008) ‘Mathematics Teaching and Learning as a Mediating Process: The Case of Tape Diagrams’, Mathematical Thinking and Learning, 10:4, 374-406.) This system is easy to use, inexpensive, and puts the student on math learning auto-pilot.",GRAIN PETER GREGORY,GRAIN PETER GREGORY,,https://lens.org/090-977-796-244-610,Patent Application,yes,0,1,1,1,0,G09B19/02;;G09B23/02;;G09B19/02;;G09B23/02,G09B19/02,434/191,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
