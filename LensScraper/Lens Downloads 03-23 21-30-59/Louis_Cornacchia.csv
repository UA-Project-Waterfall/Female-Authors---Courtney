Actuator assembly adapted for use with bipolar electrosurgical instrument, comprises connector, intended for installation of actuating mechanism assembly on tool fork, and switch on connector, which is made with possibility of movement between open position and closed position, wherein the connector is configured to be connected to the electric current generating device for supplying electric current to the tool yoke in response to the switch movement from the open position to the closed position, and actuator lever characterized by the presence of a proximal portion which is configured to be mounted on the connector to move the actuator lever by the user's hand to the switch in order to bring the breaker into a closed position by contacting the switch with the actuator lever, wherein the actuator lever and the connector are made so that the actuator lever extends from its proximal portion towards the distal portion of one of the plates and is spaced from outer surface of said plate to allow movement of actuator lever in direction of said outer surface and into contact with switch when actuator assembly is mounted on tool yoke. Electrosurgical device comprises a bipolar electrosurgical instrument comprising tweezers, having a tool fork on the proximal portion and two plates mounted on the instrument yoke, with opposing inner surfaces, wherein each said plate passes from the instrument plug to the electrode on its distal portion and is characterized by the presence of an outer surface with a handle on its intermediate portion so that the user can force the tweezers by hand, wherein tool yoke is electrically connected with electrodes for application of electric current applied to tool yoke when user drives tweezers by means of handles and actuator assembly.EFFECT: use of inventions enables reducing a risk and delaying an operation.19 cl, 11 dwg",BIPAD LLC,CORNACCHIA LOUIS,,https://lens.org/109-651-279-433-948,Granted Patent,no,6,0,19,19,0,A61B18/1206;;A61B18/1442;;A61B2018/00178;;A61B2018/00589;;A61B2018/00595;;A61B2018/00601;;A61B2018/00708;;A61B2018/00922;;A61B2018/00928;;A61B2018/00958;;A61B2018/1462;;A61B18/1206;;A61B18/1442;;A61B18/1206;;A61B18/1442;;A61B2018/00178;;A61B2018/00589;;A61B2018/00595;;A61B2018/00601;;A61B2018/00708;;A61B2018/00922;;A61B2018/00928;;A61B2018/0094;;A61B2018/00958;;A61B2018/1462;;A61B2018/00946;;A61B2018/00952;;A61B2018/126,A61B18/12,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Each of these syringes is driven by a motor which compresses the plunger of the syringe causing it to inject its contents. The motors receive an activation signal from a computer controller which initiates the injection sequence upon receipt of a trigger signal which is provided either by a separate seizure detection computer, by activation by the patient who recognizes an aura indicative of an imminent seizure, or by activation by medical personnel observing the patient. The computer implements a delay cycle to permit verification of the trigger to avoid initiating the injection sequence in the event of false alarms. Since the radionuclide is placed in the syringe in advance of the actual injection, decay of the radioactive element is compensated for by storing more radionuclide in the syringe than is needed, then calculating the quantity of radionuclide to be injected based upon the time delay from the filling of the syringe to the occurrence of the seizure and the half life of the radionuclide.",UNIV CALIFORNIA,CORNACCHIA LOUIS;;ALKSNE JOHN K;;OZAKI GEORGE;;YEUNG DAVID W,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THE (1993-09-14),https://lens.org/125-599-039-084-894,Granted Patent,yes,4,187,1,1,0,A61M5/007;;A61M5/1407;;A61M5/1452;;A61M5/16827;;A61M2205/50;;A61M5/1407;;A61M5/16827;;A61M2205/50;;A61M5/007;;A61M5/1452,A61M5/00;;A61M5/145,600/4;;128/655,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
