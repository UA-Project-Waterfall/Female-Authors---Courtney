A 3-D model of the exterior surface of the human body is created, and the scanned data is analyzed by characteristics of reflectance and surface topology to identify unhealthy characteristics. Because people will use a cosmetics system widely and frequently, base lines of patients' conditions can be created through frequent monitoring over a long time period, so that potentially dangerous changes from the base line can identified quickly and reported on. When appropriate, precise applications of medications to treat affected areas may be made automatically.

Because people will use a cosmetics system widely and frequently, base lines of patients' conditions can be created through frequent monitoring over a long time period, so that potentially dangerous changes from the base line can identified quickly and reported on.
