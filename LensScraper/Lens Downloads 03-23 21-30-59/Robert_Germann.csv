In this connection, the method relates to the fabricating and the provision of a wire-grid polarization beam splitter within an optical waveguide, which utilizes a diblock copolymer template to formulate the wire-grid.",IBM,BLACK CHARLES T;;BONA GIAN-LUCA;;DALTON TIMOTHY J;;FULLER NICHOLAS C M;;GERMANN ROLAND;;MCGLASHAN-POWELL MAURICE;;NARAYAN CHANDRASEKHAR;;SANDSTORM ROBERT L,GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. INC (2020-10-22);;GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. 2 LLC (2015-06-29);;GLOBALFOUNDRIES INC (2015-09-10),https://lens.org/170-954-775-111-737,Granted Patent,yes,6,2,4,4,0,B29D11/00759;;G02B6/126;;G02B6/136;;G02B2006/1215;;G02B6/126;;B29D11/00759;;G02B6/136;;G02B2006/1215,G02B6/00;;G02B6/10,385/11;;385/130;;385/131;;359/495,5,1,160-980-847-759-302,10.1002/pola.10977,"C.
