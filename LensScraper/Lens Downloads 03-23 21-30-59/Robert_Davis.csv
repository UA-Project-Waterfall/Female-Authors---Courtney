REED & CO., Ltd., A. E. Oct. 15, 1954 [Oct. 15, 1953], No. 28499/53. Class 31 (1). A machine employing rotary knives 3 for cutting a continuously - fed web 2 into lengths is provided with a drive mechanism between the knives and the means 1 for feeding the web comprising a differential gear 26 which through two of its connections conveys the drive to or from a gear-box 10 affording positive drive at two or more velocity ratios and has its third connection coupled through a variable gear 29 coupled directly or indirectly to one of the first two connections, the two gears 10, 29 thereby permitting continuous variation in the velocity ratio between the knives and feed means and therefore the cutting of the webs into accurate lengths. The gear-box 10 is shown as having its input shaft 9 driven from a motor through bevel gears 7 and comprises (a) two gears 11 fast on the shaft 9 for driving a layshaft 13 through either of two gears 12 as determined by a clutch 14 on the latter shaft, and (b) two further gears 20 on the layshaft for driving an output shaft 18 through either of two gears 19 as determined by a clutch 20 on the layshaft. The output shaft 18 is connected to one shaft 25 of the differential gear 26, the other shaft 27 of which drives the web-feeding rolls 1 through bevel gears 8 ; the casing of the differential gear is connected by a chain drive 28 to the continuously-variable gear 29 which is driven by a chain 30 from a sprocket 31 on either the layshaft 13 or output shaft 28 on the gear-box 10. In the form shown, the motor driving the input shaft 9 of the gear-box 10 also drives the cutter rolls 3 through variable-speed gearing 6, such as elliptical gearing or a four-bar kinetic chain, to ensure that the speed of the knives at the actual point of cutting is the same as that of the web. The gear-box 10 provides for drive at any of four velocity ratios and it is stated to be advantageous to select the gear ratios so that when the machine is set to cut comparatively short lengths the unit 29 takes a smaller part of the load than it does when the machine is set to cut longer lengths. The two sections of the gear-box 10 and the gear 29 are controlled by handles 16, 22, 32, the handle 32 for the gear 29 being coupled to a pointer 33 movable over a dial 34 which is provided with four scales each calibrated to read directly the cut-off lengths corresponding to one of the four gear ratios of the gear-box 10. Instead of connecting the drive motor to the cutting knives, it may be connected to the feed means or at an intermediate point in the transmission ; usually, however, it is connected at the end of the mechanism where the greater power is required. In further modifications : (a) the gear-box 10 is of epicyclic type, (b) separate drive motors may be provided for the knives and feed mechanism, the above-described mechanism then being interconnected between the knives and feed mechanism so that while it transmits only a relatively small proportion of the drive it serves to correlate the speeds of the knives and feed rolls, and (c) two of the drive mechanisms are arranged to connect two sets of cutting knives to a common feed mechanism whereby a sheet previously cut into two strips may be cut into the same or different lengths according to the setting of the two mechanisms.",ALBERT E REED & COMPANY LTD,DAVIS ROBERT,,https://lens.org/010-770-802-792-892,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,B26D5/22;;D06H7/02,B26D5/22;;D06H7/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Workman, R. D. June 14. Moulding bricks. - Relates to apparatus for separating or spacing bricks on the pallets or receiving boards of brick-cutting tables. The column of clay from the pug-mill or extrusion machine is pushed through the cutting-wires W on to a series of metal plates P by a board M actuated by a lever H. The plates are attached to a series of concentric tubes C arranged to slide one within another, and are separated by a stepped cone which is mounted on a central rod or spindle C<1>. On the return movement of the lever H, a spindle E carrying a lever A and crank arms is rotated by an endless belt and ratchet arrangement G ; the spindle C' is slid longitudinally by bell-crank levers ; and the stepped cone is brought against the ends of the tubes in succession so as to separate the plates. The crank arms on the spindle E act on a sliding frame S carrying the cone, tubes, and plates so as to withdraw the plates from under the bricks B<2> which are left on the pallet Q. A fixed bar K prevents the cut bricks from moving when the plates are withdrawn. The pallet with the out spaced bricks on it is removed by hand, a fresh pallet is placed in position, and the cone and plates are returned to their original position by the lever A. The plates may be connected to a series of parallel bars operated in a like manner, or they may be arranged to slide on a rod or tube and be separated by a racked sliding bar. An endless carrier band or other device having periodic motion may be substituted for the removable pallets.",WORKMAN ROBERT DAVIS,WORKMAN ROBERT DAVIS,,https://lens.org/197-029-848-580-65X,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Both the samples from the tapped delay line and the contents of the prior decision register are coupled to a weighting matrix processor which is updated to permit adaptation to different channels conditions. When initially placed into operation, a training sequence is coupled to a reference register and differences between arrived-at decisions and the true symbols are employed to provide an error vector which is then used to update the weighting matrix in the processor. Decisions on the data estimates are hard-limited to form a set of M prior decisions which are placed into the prior decision register. The training sequence is employed over a suitable acquisition time so that the weights of the processor matrix will have stabilized at values suitable for the channel through which unknown digital data will be transmitted. Because the equalizer of the invention is non-linear, it can remove intersymbol interference without the severe noise enhancement problem of linear equalizers on some channels. Moreover, not only can it remove intersymbol interference from both precursors and postcursors, but it has the ability to modify previously made decisions upon the receipt of additional data from the channel.",HARRIS CORP,DAVIS ROBERT C,HARRIS CORPORATION (1982-08-25),https://lens.org/139-475-674-067-00X,Granted Patent,yes,13,51,1,1,0,H04L25/03146;;H04L25/03146,H04L25/03,375/11;;333/18;;364/724,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The casing of an axial-flow compressor of a gas turbine engine is stiffened by annular bands 54, Fig. 6, preferably of channel section as shown, which encircle the casing, one at each row of stator blades 22. The blades may be fixed or, as shown, adjustable. Each band 54 is clamped against the casing wall 12 by a series of bushing assemblies 56, each comprising an inner bush 62 and an outer bush 58, formed with flanges 64, 60 respectively, which are passed through holes in the casing wall 12 and band 54 and then deformed as shown at 92a, 94a. A cylindrical member 66 is secured to each vane stub by a controlled-torque nut 90. In the case where the blades 22 are adjustable, each member 66 forms a journal, a carbon bearing sleeve 86 being interposed between it and the bushing assembly 56. A flange 78 on the journal 66 seats against a bearing flange 86a, and a washer 88 is interposed between the flange 60 and a bearing surface 42 of the blade stub. The blades are adjusted in unison by an actuating ring 32 and lever arms 30. Preferably, each lever arm 30 is apertured to fit closely on a recessed annular seat 80, to which it is brazed or otherwise joined. The compressor casing may be split on a horizontal plane, the two halves 10a, 10b, Fig. 7, being joined by a pair of channel bars 100a, 100<SP>b</SP> which are bolted together.

    A compound autogyro has a unique system of rotor blade retraction and vectored thrust. Redundant thrust systems provide for emergency conditions. Located in the upper mast are twin gas lines leading to a hub section of the rotor. In the hub, they divide the mass flow into two additional gas lines reaching to the tip ends of rigid rotor blades. A revolving, upper section of the rotor mast is attached to a lower, non-rotating section by a spherical bearing. Directly beneath this attach bearing is a distribution plenum, which receives the mass flow from each of three or four turbofan engines. To achieve high levels of propulsion, the turbofans are equipped with vectoring vanes that direct the mass flow to a plenum or, in the alternative, out a jet pipe for conventional flight. Another set of vectoring vanes can direct the mass flow downwardly, in case of a serious failure upon takeoff.

    A zipper closure system is disclosed comprising one or more slider bodies with a reinforced bracing integrated with a lock eyelet, a closed bail, slider body top and bottom platforms and a slider body diamond. A releasing pull tab assembly comprised of a pull tab channeled to receive a pull tab connector attaches to the slider body. The connector's head portion encompasses the slider body's bail and the connector's lower portion is mated with the pull tab securely attaching connector to the pull tab. At a predetermined force, the connector will release from the pull tab, releasing the slider body with no loss of functionality. The other components are designed to withstand a force in excess of the predetermined force. This release prevents damage to other components. The predetermined release force ranges from 25 to 200 pounds in alternate embodiments. A consumer can easily repair the unit by mating the original or replacement connector piece with the pull tab. The pull tab can be retro fit to other slider body systems. A lock eyelet designed to dock with a facing, opposing lock eyelet in a flush manner so as to lock without twisting the slider bodies is also disclosed. In another embodiment, a lock eyelet is designed to dock in a flush manner with a seam lock eyelet so as to lock without twisting seam lock or slider body. The seam lock is attached to a reinforced seam at the end of the zipper track.

   Currently migratory fisheries are impeded in their upstream and downstream movements by one or more dams across rivers. A method and structure is described that overcomes the shortcomings of currently employed methods such as fish ladders, water spilling and barging. A channel of sufficient dimensions to simulate a natural stream bed is employed to parallel the entire length of river and reservoirs and provide passage for the fish. This is accomplished without the breaching and destruction of the dams bypassed.

A dual satellite antenna receives the signals from two separate satellites, each of which can correspond to a respective satellite communication service. The received satellite signals are processed into two separate frequency bands. A frequency converter using frequency division multiplexing converts at least one of the received frequency bands so as to position both of the frequency bands adjacent to each other. A summer receives the adjacent frequency bands and distributes them on a single cable line to receivers so that the receivers have access to the separate multiple satellite communication service signals on a single cable line.

   A disc screen apparatus is disclosed for separating mixed recyclable materials of varying sizes and shapes. The disc screen apparatus has an enclosure or frame with an input, a container discharge location and a paper discharge location. A first plurality of shafts and second plurality of shafts are rotatably supported by the frame. The first plurality of shafts form a first disc screen disposed in a first plane and the second plurality of shafts form a second disc screen at least a portion of which is disposed in a second plane. The second plane is disposed beneath and angled with respect to the first plane such that the planes at least partially overlap. One or more motors rotate the first and second plurality of shafts. Each shaft has a plurality of discs positioned along it. The discs are offset between adjacent shafts such that discs on each shaft interleave with discs on an adjacent shaft but do not touch the adjacent shaft. The discs are substantially square in shape with radiused corners. The radiused corners have a texture, such as ridges. The arrangement of the discs on the shafts creates a screening pattern capable of screening a portion of the mixed recyclable materials. Each disc is assembled about a shaft from two identical portions. The portions are clamped together, about the shaft to form the disc. If the disc is damaged or worn, it may be removed from the shaft for repair or replacement without disassembly of the shaft from the apparatus or removal of other discs.

For Instance, all Water and Wastewater Plants are designed to accommodate influent flow rates that are not consistent from one hour to the next. These flow rates are generally expressed as low flow rate, average daily flow rate, and maximum flow rate. In both types of plants there are generally pump stations, screenings and grit removal, clarifiers, filters, odor control, various types of chemical injections, and storage tanks. In addition there are typically local control panels communicating information about a particular process to a Central Control Room. Generally the major local control panels are provided with programmable logic controllers that interface through software with operator work stations that are located in the Central Control Room. Due to the flow not being consistent flowing into plants, there needs to be a provision that equipment such as a pump can be started or stopped utilizing a level monitoring device to control the pump when an increasing or decreasing level change occurs in the tank. If an amount of various chemical needs to be injected in the process line depending on the influent flow rate then a flow meter needs to be in the process line monitoring and controlling the dosing rate into the pipe line. These are some examples in why the Process Loop Sheets play a role in both Water and Wastewater Plant design. There needs to be a communication device that engineers, plant operators, and contractors can review and come to the same conclusion on the operation of that process. However not all loop sheets depict what is necessary for a complete operation. What is provided for your review is a better innovated design. In a previous attachment that I have sent, there are drawings showing designs of other consultants in 11″×17″ sheets. You may want to review their approach and mine for a better comparison.

The noise is reduced as a consequence of its inherent negative correlation properties (utilized in the accumulation of successive samples of the recovered signal).",HARRIS CORP,DAVIS ROBERT C,HARRIS CORPORATION MELBOURNE FL (1987-04-23),https://lens.org/125-289-593-634-407,Granted Patent,yes,5,20,1,1,0,H04L27/2017;;H04L27/2334;;H04L27/2017;;H04L27/2334,H04L27/20;;H04L27/233,375/80;;375/94;;375/99;;375/46;;375/79,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In an embodiment, the at least one angular edge occurring on the rear surface can be machined to a radius of approximately 1.5"", and the at least one angular edge occurring on the front surface can be machined to a radius of approximately 0.35"". At least one attachment structure can be provided on at least one terminal end of the support member basic form. In an embodiment, the attachment structure can be provided as a pair of cylindrical pegs, each of which extends from a respective terminal end of the support member basic form. The elongate support member basic form can be fabricated from an inert crystalline material, such as polycrystalline silicon or monocrystalline silicon. A support member for wafer processing fixtures is also disclosed. The support member can include an elongate body portion having a pair of opposite terminal ends, an arcuate front surface with a first radius of curvature, and an arcuate rear surface with a second radius of curvature. The first radius of curvature can be substantially smaller than the second radius of curvature. A plurality of mutually parallel wafer-retaining slots are formed in the front surface of the body portion.",INTEGRATED MATERIALS INC,ZEHAVI RAANAN;;DAVIS ROBERT,FERROTEC (USA) CORPORATION (2011-09-01);;HANGZHOU DUNYUANJUXIN SEMICONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY CO.

Such vehicles are usually fitted with a levelling valve operated by rise or fall of one axle to admit pressure air to or release it from the air springs to maintain a constant ride height. The tyres on a lifted axle lose their deflection when load is removed from them, reducing their clearance from the road surface. An extensible member 49 is provided in the operating linkage for levelling valve 47. Extension of member 49 as or when an axle is lifted causes operation of valve 47 to admit pressure air to the air springs of the laden axle(s). These springs extend and in so doing neutralise valve 47 so that trailer then runs at an increased ride height. <IMAGE>",RUBERY OWEN ROCKWELL LTD,DAVIS ROBERT CLIVE BROWNING,,https://lens.org/108-337-353-240-81X,Patent Application,no,0,8,4,4,0,B60G17/0523;;B62D61/125,B60G17/052;;B62D61/12,B7D DTL           DTL;;B7D D2A6B         DTL;;B7D D2A6F         DTL,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
