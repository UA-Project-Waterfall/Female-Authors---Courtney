    Apparatus and method for manufacturing a filter element by winding a fluted media into a coreless roll. The fluted filter media is transported forwardly and a front edge is lifted upwardly by a rearwardly facing inclined ramp. A rearwardly facing surface pushes the front edge rearwardly, and then a downwardly facing surface pushes it downwardly, thereby forming an incipient log, or roll start. The remaining portion of the fluted media is then rolled around the incipient log, thereby making a coreless cylindrical fluted filter media.

In particular, identification and quantification of possibly malignant regions identified in these high-resolution images is essential for accurate and timely diagnosis. However, careful quantitative assessment of lung and liver lesions is tedious and time consuming.
