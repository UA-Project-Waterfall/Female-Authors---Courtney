The method also includes the step of inserting a distal end of the disk prosthesis into a gap between the first and second vertebrae. The disk prosthesis includes a first part with a convexly-shaped and rounded outer surface and an inner surface having a concavely-shaped socket. The disk prosthesis also includes a second part that has a convexly-shaped and rounded outer surface and an inner surface that has a convexly-shaped portion that at least partially engages with the socket thereby allowing at least two-degrees of freedom of movement of the first part with respect to the second part.

The frame has an upper portion (16) and a lower portion (18). The upper and lower portions are partially convex, spaced from each other and joined together by distal and proximal supports (14,22). A housing is comprised of a second material for minimizing interference with imaging. The housing (38) has a convexly tapered distal end and two generally parallel side walls (40,42) spaced from each other and extending from the tapered distal end. The housing is coupled to the frame by cooperatively surrounding at least a portion of the frame and oriented such that the side walls are generally perpendicular to the upper and lower portions of the frame when assembled.

The method also includes the step of inserting a distal end of the disk prosthesis into a gap between the first and second vertebrae. The disk prosthesis includes a first part with a convexly-shaped and rounded outer surface and an inner surface having a concavely-shaped socket. The disk prosthesis also includes a second part that has a convexly-shaped and rounded outer surface and an inner surface that has a convexly-shaped portion that at least partially engages with the socket thereby allowing at least two-degrees of freedom of movement of the first part with respect to the second part. The method further includes the step of permitting the top of the first part to contact the first vertebra and the bottom of the second part to contact the second vertebra.,CONCEPT MATRIX LLC,ECKMAN WALTER W,,https://lens.org/153-580-971-427-173,Patent Application,no,0,0,14,14,0,A61F2/30907;;A61F2/4425;;A61F2/4611;;A61F2002/30112;;A61F2002/30242;;A61F2002/30253;;A61F2002/30331;;A61F2002/30462;;A61F2002/3049;;A61F2002/30649;;A61F2002/30685;;A61F2002/30784;;A61F2002/30797;;A61F2002/30807;;A61F2002/4627;;A61F2002/4629;;A61F2220/0025;;A61F2220/0033;;A61F2220/0075;;A61F2230/0004;;A61F2230/0071;;A61F2230/0076;;A61F2310/00017;;A61F2310/00023;;A61F2310/00029;;A61F2310/00179;;A61F2310/00796;;A61F2/4603;;A61F2/4425;;A61F2002/30331;;A61F2310/00017;;A61F2310/00179;;A61F2002/30807;;A61F2310/00796;;A61F2002/3049;;A61F2230/0071;;A61F2002/4629;;A61F2220/0025;;A61F2002/30649;;A61F2002/30253;;A61F2310/00029;;A61F2002/30462;;A61F2002/4627;;A61F2002/30242;;A61F2002/30784;;A61F2220/0033;;A61F2230/0076;;A61F2310/00023;;A61F2/30907;;A61F2/4611;;A61F2002/30685;;A61F2230/0004;;A61F2220/0075;;A61F2002/30797;;A61F2002/30112;;A61F2/4603,A61B17/58;;A61F2/00;;A61F2/30;;A61F2/44;;A61F2/46,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
