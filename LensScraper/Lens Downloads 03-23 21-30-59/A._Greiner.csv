The gyroscope is mounted in an integrated test and correction apparatus comprising an angularly positionable mount supported on a shaker table. The mount supports a test chamber in which the spinning gyroscope is located in a low viscosity, low density atmosphere. Windows are formed in the chamber on opposite sides permitting lasers fixed on the mount to be aimed at the flywheel to burn off selected portions of its mass. A safety system is arranged within the chamber to detect whether the spot at which a given laser beam is aimed has already received a laser burn. Mass unbalance is determined, with the spin axis polar, by rotating the gyroscopic reference axes 90 DEG and recording the drift at two orientations. Radial unbalance is determined by imparting a reciprocating motion along the spin axis by means of the shaker table at the same rate as the rotation of the flywheel. By shifting the phase of the vibratory motion relative to the rotation of the flywheel, a maximum signal proportional to the radial unbalance is sensed by one of the gyro pick-offs. Modulation is determined directly by detecting the amplitude of a modulating signal on the pick-off signal. An automated closed-loop procedure determines the correct pattern of laser burns on the flywheel to minimize the unbalances.",SINGER CO,MOLL D;;GREINER A,KEARFOTT GUIDANCE AND NAVIGATION CORPORATION (1988-04-25),https://lens.org/092-822-225-245-405,Granted Patent,no,7,10,8,10,0,G01C25/005;;G01M1/22;;G01M1/30;;G01M1/34;;G01M1/30;;G01C25/005;;G01M1/22;;G01M1/34,G01C25/00;;G01M1/30;;G01M1/34;;G01M1/38,219-121   L,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The apparatus includes a chamber with an orifice plate at one end and a pair of tubular pressure taps located on either side of the orifice plate whereby one tap is located on the upstream side of the orifice plate and the other is located at the downstream side. Both taps have a particular location and configuration to avoid clogging whenever the bags are cleaned. The apparatus is used in a sequentially timed and controlled system for measuring and recording bag performance of many bags in a baghouse. The system is formed by attaching the above apparatus to a plurality of bags in a baghouse and connecting the pressure taps from each apparatus to a sequentially activated and controlled valve system which individually measures the pressure drop at each bag through the use of a single differential pressure-measuring device. The controlled valve system also allows purge gas to pass through the taps while isolating the pressure-measuring device from the taps through which the purged gas is passing. The system also includes a baghouse temperature sensor, a baghouse pressure drop measuring device and a recording device so that individual bag flow and fabric drag can be calculated and recorded.",ETS INC,GREINER GARY;;FURLONG DALE A,ETS INC (1986-12-01),https://lens.org/051-233-612-165-330,Granted Patent,yes,17,29,8,8,0,B01D46/0086;;B01D46/02;;B01D46/44;;B01D46/0086;;B01D46/02;;B01D46/44,G01N15/08;;B01D46/02;;B01D46/04;;B01D46/42;;B01D46/44,73/38,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The computer system uses T to hill climb from the initial fault hierarchy KB0, through successive hierarchies, KB1... KBm, with successively higher empirical accuracies over C. At each stage, to go from a fault hierarchy KBk to its neighbor KBk+1, the computer system must evaluate KBk's accuracy over C, as well as the accuracy of each KB' ELEMENT N(KBk). The computer system provides an efficient way of evaluating the accuracy of KBk, and each θi(KBk), towards determining which, if any, θi(KBk) is more accurate than KBk. It exploits a few key observations. First, as each transformation used to map one hierarchy to a related one performs only local changes to the hierarchy, it will have only minor and easily computed effects on any instance. Second, most transformations will have no effect on many instances. Finally, one can bound how much the accuracy score for a knowledge base can change based on any instance, which means branch-and-bound techniques can be used to avoid computing the accuracy scores for various hierarchies that cannot be optimal. <IMAGE>",SIEMENS CORP RES INC,GREINER RUSSELL;;RAO R BHARAT;;MEREDITH GLENN A,,https://lens.org/063-498-375-309-212,Granted Patent,no,0,0,10,10,0,G06N5/025;;G06N5/01;;G06N5/025;;G06N5/01,G06N5/00;;G06N5/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The computer system uses T to hill climb from the initial fault hierarchy KB0, through successive hierarchies, KB1... KBm, with successively higher empirical accuracies over C. At each stage, to go from a fault hierarchy KBk to its neighbor KBk+1, the computer system must evaluate KBk's accuracy over C, as well as the accuracy of each KB' ELEMENT N(KBk). The computer system provides an efficient way of evaluating the accuracy of KBk, and each θi(KBk), towards determining which, if any, θi(KBk) is more accurate than KBk. It exploits a few key observations. First, as each transformation used to map one hierarchy to a related one performs only local changes to the hierarchy, it will have only minor and easily computed effects on any instance. Second, most transformations will have no effect on many instances. Finally, one can bound how much the accuracy score for a knowledge base can change based on any instance, which means branch-and-bound techniques can be used to avoid computing the accuracy scores for various hierarchies that cannot be optimal. <IMAGE>",SIEMENS CORP RES INC,GREINER RUSSELL;;RAO R BHARAT;;MEREDITH GLENN A,,https://lens.org/132-905-725-008-759,Granted Patent,no,0,0,10,10,0,G06N5/025;;G06N5/01;;G06N5/025;;G06N5/01,G06N5/00;;G06N5/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Preferred CD154 antagonists and CD8+ T cell depleting agents are anti-CD154 and CD8 antibodies. The CD154 antagonists and CD8+ T cell depleting agents are typically administered to a transplant recipient following transplantation of the tissue or organ. The methods of the invention can be used to induce T cell tolerance to transplants such as pancreas, pituitary, liver, kidney, heart, lung, skin, muscle, brain tissue, nerve tissue, stomach, intestines, Adenosine Deaminase-expressing cells, and leptin-expressing cells. A method for treating a skin disorder comprising administering to a subject allogeneic or xenogeneic tissues, organs, or cells expressing donor antigens, CD154 antagonists and CD8+ T cell depleting agents and allogeneic skin graft cells is also disclosed.",UNIV MASSACHUSETTS;;ROSSINI ALDO A;;IWAKOSHI NEAL;;MORDES JOHN P;;GREINER DALE L,ROSSINI ALDO A;;IWAKOSHI NEAL;;MORDES JOHN P;;GREINER DALE L,,https://lens.org/022-555-269-823-868,Patent Application,yes,0,2,3,3,0,A61K38/00;;A61K2039/505;;A61P17/00;;A61P37/00;;C07K16/2875;;C07K16/2815,A61K38/095;;C07K16/28,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The methods involve administering to a subject antagonists of the receptor which inhibit interaction of the ligand with the receptor, and CD8+ T cell depleting agents. In a preferred embodiment, the molecules on the surface of the T cell which mediate contact-dependent helper effector function are CD154. Preferred CD154 antagonists and CD8+ T cell depleting agents are anti-CD154 and CD8 antibodies. The CD154 antagonists and CD8+ T cell depleting agents are typically administered to a transplant recipient following transplantation of the tissue or organ. The methods of the invention can be used to induce T cell tolerance to transplants such as pancreas, pituitary, liver, kidney, heart, lung, skin, muscle, brain tissue, nerve tissue, stomach, intestines, Adenosine Deaminase-expressing cells, and leptin-expressing cells. A method for treating a skin disorder comprising administering to a subject allogeneic or xenogeneic tissues, organs, or cells expressing donor antigens, CD154 antagonists and CD8+ T cell depleting agents and allogeneic skin graft cells is also disclosed.",UNIV MASSACHUSETTS;;ROSSINI ALDO A;;IWAKOSHI NEAL;;MORDES JOHN P;;GREINER DALE L,ROSSINI ALDO A;;IWAKOSHI NEAL;;MORDES JOHN P;;GREINER DALE L,,https://lens.org/016-652-247-339-896,Search Report,yes,2,0,3,3,0,A61K38/00;;A61K2039/505;;A61P17/00;;A61P37/00;;C07K16/2875;;C07K16/2815,A61K38/095;;C07K16/28,,5,5,051-857-583-713-750;;021-678-711-055-624;;007-779-863-587-895;;038-066-621-682-202;;021-702-152-826-898,10.1172/jci2703;;pmc508834;;9616216;;10.1152/physrev.1999.79.1.99;;9922369;;10.1097/00007890-199901150-00022;;9921809;;8751584;;10.1016/s0039-6060(96)80289-3;;10.4049/jimmunol.164.1.512;;10605049,"MARKEES THOMAS G ET AL: ""Long-term survival of skin allografts induced by donor splenocytes and anti-CD154 antibody in thymectomized mice requires CD4+ T cells, interferon-gamma, and CTLA4."", JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION, vol. 101, no. 11, 1 June 1998 (1998-06-01), pages 2446 - 2455, XP000943840, ISSN: 0021-9738;;ROSSINI ALDO A ET AL: ""Induction of immunologic tolerance for transplantation."", PHYSIOLOGICAL REVIEWS, vol. 79, no. 1, January 1999 (1999-01-01), pages 99 - 141, XP000943509, ISSN: 0031-9333;;HE GANG ET AL: ""The role of CD8 and CD4 T cells in intestinal allograft rejection."", TRANSPLANTATION (BALTIMORE), vol. 67, no. 1, 15 January 1999 (1999-01-15), pages 131 - 137, XP000943475, ISSN: 0041-1337;;REHMAN ATIQ ET AL: ""Long-term survival of rat to mouse cardiac xenografts with prolonged blockade of CD28-B7 interaction combined with peritransplant T-cell depletion."", SURGERY (ST LOUIS), vol. 120, no. 2, 1996, pages 205 - 212, XP000943512, ISSN: 0039-6060;;IWAKOSHI N.

SOLUTION: A self-commissioning controller is constituted by a self- commissioning logic 48, and the logic 48 automatically calculates P-I control parameters (KI, KP, and GC) and a motor parameter (τR) and supplies them to a line 149 and then supplies a parameter Id REF to a control device 14. Also, the controller receives a start instruction signal from a service tool 80 through a link 82 and performs control when automatic calibration is started, thus eliminating the need for separating a motor from the field or for special testing facility or especially trained engineer and hence adjustment time and expenses are reduced.",OTIS ELEVATOR CO,COLBY ROY STEPHEN;;VECCHIOTTI ALBERTO;;GREINER NEIL A;;LAMONTAGNE LESLIE M;;THEBEAU RONNIE E,,https://lens.org/117-447-252-365-326,Patent Application,no,0,0,9,9,0,H02P21/06;;H02P21/16;;H02P21/06;;H02P21/16,H02P21/00;;H02P21/06;;H02P21/14;;B66B1/30;;H02P27/04;;H02P29/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

    The temperature (  25, 33, 43  ) of solid state switching devices in variable speed motor drives (  11, 18  ), such as elevator motor drives, are utilized to reduce the load on the drive, by reducing the switching frequency (  50  ) or the commanded load (  110  ). The choice between the preferred non-switching zero state and an alternative zero state is determined (  60  ) by temperature (  28, 34, 56  ) of the switched transistor's anti-parallel diode. The rate of recognizing reduced temperatures is limited (  33, 34  ) to avoid motor speed and/or load variations. The temperature may either be measured (  24, 27  ) or determined (  70  ) from models utilizing manufacturer product specification and normalized thermal transient response from the transistor/diode package to a heat sink.

In either preferred configuration, an electric motor contained within the latch housing operates to open or unlock the latch. Latch closure may be provided by spring actuation in a slam configuration or by further motor operation in a dead bolt configuration.

The methods involve contacting a T cell with: 1) a cell which presents antigen to the T cell, wherein a ligand on the cell interacts with a receptor on the surface of the T cell which mediates contact-dependent helper effector function; and 2) an antagonist of the receptor on the surface of the T cell which inhibits interaction of the ligand on the antigen presenting cell with the receptor on the T cell. In a preferred embodiment, the cell which presents antigen to the T cell is a B cell and the receptor on the surface of the T cell which mediates contact-dependent helper effector function is gp39. Preferably, the antagonist is an anti-gp39 antibody or a soluble gp39 ligand (e.g., soluble CD40). The methods of the invention can be used to induce T cell tolerance to a soluble antigen or to an allogeneic cell.

Fremgangsmåtene omfatter å administrere til en transplantatmottaker: 1) en allogeneisk eller xenogeneisk celle som uttrykker minst ett donorantigen og som har en ligand på celleoverflaten som vekselvirker med en receptor på overflaten av en mottaker T~celle som medierer berøringsavhengig hjelperutløsningsfunksjon og 2) en antagonist av receptoren, som hemmer vekselvirkning mellom liganden og receptoren. I en foretrukken utførelsesform er den allogeneiske eller xenogeneiske celle en B-celle, fortrinnsvis en hvilende Bcelle, og molekylet på overflaten av T-cellen som medierer berøringsavhengig hjelper-utløsningsfunksjon, er gp39. En foretrukken gp39-antagonist er et anti-gp39-antistoff. Den allogeneiske eller xenogeneiske celle og gp39-antagonisten administreres vanligvis til en transplantatmottaker før transplantasjonen av vevet eller organet. Fremgangsmåtene ifølge oppfinnelsen kan anvendes for å indusere Tcelletoleranse for transplantater så som lever, nyre, hjerte, lunge, hud, muskel, neuronalvev, mage og tarmer.
