    An insert is disclosed that is placed in the slit in a slit tipped catheter during storage of the catheter. This insert prevents opposite of the slit from contacting and forming bonds that tend to close the slit. When the catheter is to be used, the insert is removed and the catheter is used in its intended way.

   A display node in a graphical program may be used to automatically transfer an image from an embedded device lacking display capabilities to another device having a display. A method for displaying an image involves creating a graphical program on a display in response to user input and executing the graphical program on a first embedded system. The graphical program may include a first node for acquiring an image and a second node for displaying the image. If the first embedded system is coupled to a second system having a display device, executing the graphical program involves the second node transferring the image to the second system and directing the second system to display the image on the display device of the second system. If the first embedded system is not coupled to a second system having a display device, the second node may perform no display operation during execution.
