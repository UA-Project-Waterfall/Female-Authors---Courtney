A first hinge element engages the center section and the forward section and has a first rotational centerline that is above the center section. The first hinge element enables the forward section to be folded relative to the center section. A second hinge element engages the center section and the rearward section and has a second rotational centerline. The second rotational centerline is longitudinally spaced apart from the first rotational centerline and above the center section. The second rotational centerline is vertically offset from the first rotational centerline and enables the rearward section to be folded relative to the center section. The rearward section engages the second hinge element for rotation about the second rotational centerline relative to the center section. When the trailer is in a folded position, the rearward section is positioned between the center section and the forward section.",FAHRBACH JOHN G,FAHRBACH JOHN G,,https://lens.org/012-724-943-021-907,Granted Patent,yes,66,32,1,1,0,B62D63/061;;B62D63/061,B62B1/00,280/656;;280/789,18,0,,,"Photograph, www.atvconnection.com/atvconnection/images/59784702.jpg; Dec. 11, 2005.;;Folding ramp sales literature, www.sportsmansguide.com/cb/cb.asp?a=247717; Jan. 28, 2006.;;Photograph, www.countryatv.com/5400b.jpg; Nov. 19, 2005.;;Photograph, www.countryatv.com/flatbedatv3.jpg; Nov. 19, 2005.;;Photographs, www.pawprint-trailers.com/pawprint/2-place.htm; Jan. 21 2006, 2 pgs.;;Sales literature, www.etrailerpart.com/spindles.htm; Jan. 28, 2006, 2 pgs.;;Photographs, www.pawprint-trailers.com/pawprint/subframe.htm; Jan. 21, 2006.;;Photographs, www.pawprint-trailers.com/pawprint/atv-trailer.htm; Jan. 21, 2006.;;Sales literature, www.pawprint-trailers.com/pawprint/index2.htm; Jan. 21, 2006.;;Sales literature, www.cyclecountry.com/products/trailers/5thwheel.htm; Jan. 18,2006.;;Photographs, www.pawprint-trailers.com/pawprint/accessories/boom.htm; Jan. 20, 2006.;;Sketch, www.pawprint-trailers.com/pawprint/stdfeatures/e-zlube.htm; Jan. 20, 2006.;;Photograph, www.pawprint-trailers.com/pawprint/accessories/extension.htm; Jan. 20, 2006.;;Product description, www.etrailerpart.com/halftorsionaxles.htm; Jan. 28, 2006.;;Product description, www.southwestwheel.com/sidebar/Promo3.htm; Jan. 29, 2006, 2 pgs.;;Photograph, www.pawprint-trailers.com/pawprint/stdfeatures/axle.htm; Jan. 20, 2006.;;Article, ""Flexible Rubber Torsion Axles"", 198.173.89.79/flexride.html; Jul. 2, 2006, 2 pgs.;;Sales literature, www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/templates/pod/horizontal-pod.jsp?-DARGS=/cabelas/en/co...
