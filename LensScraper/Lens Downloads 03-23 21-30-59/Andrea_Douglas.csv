    The invention relates to a document analysis method to detect BW/color areas comprising the following steps: getting an input image data to be split in elementary information; analysing the input data to get the colorfulness of each elementary information; creating a first and a second output layers corresponding to the BW and color elementary information respectively; applying a first set of atomic operations to the BW layer and a second different set of atomic operations to the color layer; and combining the BW and color layers in order to obtain a desired format for the output data. The invention also relates to a scanning device to acquire documents including an input that receives an input image data, and is connected to a layer creator component, which in turn outputs a first and a second layer, such layers having different data compression rate. Finally, the invention relates to a method for acquiring a document based on the analysis of the content of the document itself.

   The present invention relates generally to a method for the treatment or prophylaxis of animals including humans suffering from or predisposed to breast cancer or other related cancers which comprises the use of cytokines and/or functionally active derivatives, hybrids and/or analogs thereof and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising same as therapeutic agents. In particular, but not exclusively, the present invention is directed to the use of cytokines which are ligands of members of the haemopoietin receptor super family or their derivatives, hybrids or analogues as therapeutic agents. The present application also contemplates breast cancer therapies and methods of suppressing growth of normal breast cells or breast cancer cells by the use of one or more cytokines optionally in combination with other therapeutic agents as well as the use of agonists or antagonists of cytokine activity. Particularly preferred are oncostatin M (OSM) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF).

The non-overlapping clock generator circuit (41, 61) increases time for circuit operation by minimizing delays between non-overlapping clock signals and simultaneously transitioning rising edges of clock signals. A non-overlapping clock generation circuit (41) comprises six NOR gates (43-48) and an inverter (42). Three NOR gates form a first delay line (43-45) and the remaining three NOR gates form a second delay line (46-48). The inverter (42) provides an inverted clock signal to the second delay line. A clock signal propagates through one delay line while the other delay line is non-responsive due to a feedback signal from the active delay line. Once the clock signal has propagated through the active delay line, the feedback signal changes and allows NOR gates of the remaining delay line to simultaneously provide a clock signal and a delayed clock signal.",MOTOROLA INC,GARRITY DOUGLAS A;;RAKERS PATRICK L;;EBERHARDT ANDREA,FREESCALE SEMICONDUCTOR INC (2004-12-10);;MOTOROLA INC (1996-02-29),https://lens.org/011-934-759-031-119,Granted Patent,yes,9,22,1,1,0,H03K5/1515;;H03K5/1515,H03K5/151,327/259;;327/172,1,0,,,"Low Power Low Voltage Analog To Digital Conversion Techniques Using Pipelined Architectures , Electronics Research Laboratory, College of Engineering, University of California, Berkeley 94720, Memorandom No. UCB/ERL M95/23, 2 Apr. 1995.",EXPIRED

   A system and method automates and simplifies tasks associated with setting up a user self-activating network-based service. A configurable input engine is configured to define the service. The service may, for example, use a plurality of networking devices and/or computing devices. After the service is defined, an offer of the service is published to a user. The offer includes values of commercial terms and/or values of configuration parameters associated with the offer. Upon receiving an acceptance of the offer from the user, the configurable input engine automatically generates activations for the devices to be used by the service. The activations are sent to policy distribution points (PDPs) where the activations are translated into device-specific instructions. The device-specific instructions are in turn sent to the devices (networking devices and/or computing devices) to be configured. The device-specific instructions configure the devices, thereby automatically setting up the service for the user.

Upon receiving an acceptance of the offer from the user, the configurable input engine automatically generates activations for the devices to be used by the service. The activations are sent to policy distribution points (PDPs) where the activations are translated into device-specific instructions.
