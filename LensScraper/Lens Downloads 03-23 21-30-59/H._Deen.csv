An exemplary method begins by selectively loading computing task segments into a first node, wherein the number of computing task segments is the maximum number of computing task segments that will fit within the first node. The computing task segments are enclosed within wrappers, wherein the wrappers are streamed into the first node at a maximum rate that a disk can read and write data. Further, the wrappers comprise priority wrappers that must be computed in order to process the computing task segments; and thus, the priority wrappers are loaded into the first node first. In addition, the computing task segments comprise computing task segment block collections, wherein the method creates a list of computing task segment block collection jobs that must be completed in order to process one of the computing task segments.",IBM,DEEN ROBERT G KAUFMAN JAMES H,,https://lens.org/023-495-285-095-869,Patent Application,no,0,0,4,4,0,G06F9/5016;;G06F9/5016;;G06F9/5066;;G06F9/5066;;G06F2209/5017;;G06F2209/5017,G06F9/46,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The system dynamically optimizes a message pathway according to various criteria such as, for example, efficiency, economy, data requirements, auditing requirements, security, data size, etc. The system can direct a message to bypass an infrastructure messaging server, using a direct message pathway. The system can also switch from an infrastructure messaging server to a direct method. The system can also utilize an infrastructure messaging pathway either as an alternative or in parallel with the direct message pathway. The system allows an application to use a single communication system for both a direct mode and an infrastructure mode of data transfer.

The elongated image is converted into a binary image composed of a row of image elements, each with its own grey value, which binary image is obtained by assigning a first logic state to image elements having a grey value above a pre-determined threshold value and a second logic state to image elements below this threshold value.

In addition, the computing task segments comprise computing task segment block collections, wherein the method creates a list of computing task segment block collection jobs that must be completed in order to process one of the computing task segments.",IBM,DEEN ROBERT G;;KAUFMAN JAMES H;;LEHMAN TOBIN J,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (2006-01-05),https://lens.org/128-838-937-390-978,Granted Patent,yes,6,2,4,4,0,G06F9/5016;;G06F9/5016;;G06F9/5066;;G06F9/5066;;G06F2209/5017;;G06F2209/5017,G06F15/167;;G06F15/16,709/213;;709/202;;709/215;;709/214;;709/216,4,2,089-529-690-716-419;;125-098-389-213-531,10.1109/acw.2003.1210199;;10.1109/clustr.2003.1253312,"Deen et al., U.S. Appl.

The system can direct a message to bypass an infrastructure messaging server, using a direct message pathway. The system can also utilize an infrastructure messaging pathway either as an alternative or in parallel with the direct message pathway. The system allows an application to use a single communication system for both a direct mode and an infrastructure mode of data transfer. The present system can bypass the infrastructure message pathway, this reducing message latency and the number of messages to be sent, and improving overall bandwidth. <P>COPYRIGHT: (C)2007,JPO&INPIT",IBM,TOBIN JOHN LEHMAN;;ROBERT GLENN DEEN;;JAMES H KAUFMAN,,https://lens.org/183-341-741-046-690,Patent Application,no,5,0,6,6,0,H04L45/12;;H04L51/214;;H04L67/63;;H04L45/12;;H04L67/63;;H04L51/214,H04L12/56;;G06F13/00,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE
