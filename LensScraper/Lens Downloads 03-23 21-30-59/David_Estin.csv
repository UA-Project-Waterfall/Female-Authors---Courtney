The keepout map identifies portions of the area through which the robot can safely navigate, and likewise identifies portions of the area through which the robot is unable to navigate. The keepout map can be generated based on external data (such as blueprints or local area maps) or based on data from sensors included on or within the robot (such as cameras or LIDAR sensors). The keepout map can also be updated as the robot navigates within the area, for instance to identify new obstacles within the area. The robot navigates through the area by selecting a route that avoids the portions of the area that the robot is unable to navigate identified by the keepout map. The updated keepout map can be provided to a central server, for storage or distribution to one or more other robots.",MAIDBOT INC,MORONITI DAVID;;SWEET NICHOLAS;;GREEN MICAH ESTIN,,https://lens.org/094-724-910-457-784,Patent Application,no,0,1,6,6,0,G05D1/0274;;G05D1/0248;;G01C21/206;;G01C21/3807;;G01C21/387;;G06V20/64;;G06V20/20;;G05D1/0214;;G05D1/0274;;G05D1/0246,G05D1/02;;A47L11/40;;G01C21/20,,0,0,,,,PENDING
