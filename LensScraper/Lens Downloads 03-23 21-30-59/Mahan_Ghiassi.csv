Mechanical Thrombectomy improved by balloon occlusion prevents thrombus showers and follows 10 years of interventional cardiology and diagnostic use of improved radial approach (TRA) with better systems, making trans-femoral (TFA)less safe and effective than this revised treatment paradigm, unexpectedly better than literature predicted in early parts of the decade. Likewise, carotid stenting may be performed during these intracranial arterial occlusion procedures without swapping out guide catheters as required by the prior art.",CROSSROADS NEUROVASCULAR,GHIASSI MAHAN,,https://lens.org/108-706-642-529-274,Patent Application,yes,0,0,1,1,0,A61B2090/3966;;A61B17/3207;;A61B2017/320716;;A61M25/06;;A61B2017/22079;;A61M25/0054;;A61M25/10;;A61B17/3423;;A61B2090/3966;;A61B2017/22038;;A61B2017/22079;;A61B2017/22067,A61B17/34,,0,0,,,,PENDING
