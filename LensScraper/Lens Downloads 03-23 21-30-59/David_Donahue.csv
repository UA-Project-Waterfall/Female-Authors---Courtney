The hopper and its cargo are pulled out manually until a point of equilibrium is reached. As the hopper and load are pulled out past the point of equilibrium, a break in the top of the channel rails allows the rear axle on the carriage to rise up out of the track, and because the carriage and hopper are now over balanced, the hopper tilts up thereby dumping the load behind the truck.

The system generally includes a charcoal canister (122) and a carburetor (42, 170) with a fuel circuit shutoff valve (80, 222, 240). The charcoal canister is in fluid communication with the air space above the liquid fuel within the engine fuel tank (30), and optionally, with the air space above the liquid fuel within the fuel bowl (58) of a fuel bowl-type carburetor (42). The charcoal canister contains charcoal media (138) which absorbs fuel vapors when the engine is not running. During running of the engine, vacuum within the carburetor induces a flow of atmospheric air through the charcoal canister to purge the collected fuel vapors from the charcoal media, and the fuel vapors pass into the engine for consumption. The carburetor of the engine, which may be either a fuel bowl-type carburetor (42) or a diaphragm carburetor (170), includes a fuel circuit shutoff valve (80, 222, 240) controlled either by a vacuum signal produced within the engine or by a user-actuated mechanical linkage (36, 238). The fuel circuit shutoff valve closes the fuel circuit (72, 186) of the carburetor upon engine shutdown to prevent escape of fuel vapors from the carburetor to the atmosphere. In another embodiment, a weir-type carburetor (270) is disclosed which contains a minimal amount of fuel when the engine is not running to reduce or eliminate evaporative emissions.",TECUMSEH PRODUCTS CO,KIRK DAVID J;;DONAHUE RONALD J;;CARPENTER TODD L,,https://lens.org/016-427-580-748-481,Patent Application,yes,1,2,6,6,0,F02M25/0809;;F02M25/0836;;F02M25/0854;;F02M25/089;;F02M25/0809;;F02M25/0854;;F02M25/089;;F02M25/0836,F02M25/08,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

A presente invenção refere-se a um sistema para controle de emissões evaporativas para pequenos motores de combustão interna. O sistema geralmente inclui um filtro de carvão vegetal e um carburador com uma válvula de fechar o circuito de combustível. O filtro de carvão vegetal está em comunicação fluida com o espaço de ar acima do combustível líquido dentro do tanque de combustível do motor, e opcionalmente, com o espaço de ar acima do combustível líquido dentro do depósito de combustível de um carburador do tipo depósito de combustível. O filtro de carvão vegetal contém meios de carvão que absorvem vapores de combustível quando o motor não está funcionando. Durante o funcionamento do motor, o vácuo dentro do carburador induz um fluxo de ar atmosférico através do filtro de carvão vegetal para purgar os vapores de combustível coletados dos meios de carvão vegetal, e os vapores de combustível passam no motor para consumo. O carburador do motor, que pode ser ou um carburador do tipo depósito de combustível ou um carburador com diafragma, inclui uma válvula de fechar o circuito de combustível controlada ou por um sinal a vácuo produzido dentro do motor ou por uma ligação mecânica acionada pelo usuário. A válvula de fechar o circuito de combustível fecha o circuito de combustível do carburador mediante interrupção do motor para impedir escape de vapores de combustível do carburador para a atmosfera.

    An exhaust treatment device is provided for an internal combustion engine of a marine propulsion system. An outer chamber contains a first inner chamber within it and slidably supports the inner chamber. An exhaust inlet conduit directs a stream of exhaust gases from a cylinder of the internal combustion engine directly into the inner chamber. The inner and outer chambers are supported relative to each other to allow relative movement of these two components in response to changes in the differential temperature between the two components. A rail system slidably supports the inner chamber relative to the outer chamber. The exhaust treatment device comprises a liquid cooled housing surrounding the inner and outer chambers. Exhaust gas is directed through the inner chamber and then into the outer chamber at a closed end of the exhaust treatment device. Exhaust gases then flow through the outer chamber to an exhaust conduit of the marine propulsion system.

The charcoal canister is in fluid communication with the air space above the liquid fuel within the engine fuel tank, and optionally, with the air space above t he liquid fuel within the fuel bowl of a fuel bowl-type carburetor. The charcoal canister contains charcoal media which absorbs fuel vapors when the engine is not running. During running of the engine, vacuum within the carburetor induces a flow of atmospheric air through the charcoal canister to purge the collected fuel vapors from the charcoal media, and the fuel vapors pass into the engine for consumption. The carburetor of the engine, which may be either a fuel bowl-type carburetor or a diaphragm carburetor, includes a fuel circuit shutoff valve controlled either by a vacuum signal produced within the engine or by a user-actuated mechanical linkage. The fuel circuit shutoff valve closes the fuel circuit of the carburetor upon engine shutdown to prevent escape of fuel vapors from the carburetor to the atmosphere.

The printer has a row of jet forming nozzles which produce a row of spaced drop streams. The drops in the streams are selectively charged, deflected and caught, so that uncharged drops produce intelligible graphic information on the printing medium. The spacing between the jets is such that they cannot print contiguous traces upon an ordinary transported printing medium. Contiguous printing is accomplished by lateral oscillation of the printing medium. The oscillation of the printing medium causes each jet to be directed at a plurality of lateral printing positions on a sequential basis, and data representing printing information for the different printing positions is multiplexed into the drop switching system in synchronism with the oscillation of the printing medium. Oscillation of the printing medium may be accomplished by a web transport system including a cylindrical roller and an axially driven oscillator connected thereto. The roller has an internal cavity large in diameter at the midpoint of the roller and relatively small in diameter at the support points of the roller. This causes an axially varying roller cross-sectional area which reduces roller distortion at the relative high axial vibration frequency.",MEAD CORP,HUFFMAN HAROLD W;;LYON RICHARD H;;HOLMES DAVID G;;DONAHUE JOHN W,EASTMAN KODAK COMPANY A NJ CORP (1983-12-06),https://lens.org/171-333-579-753-26X,Granted Patent,yes,1,20,1,1,0,B41J2/505;;B41J2/505;;G01D15/18;;G01D15/18,B41J2/505;;G01D15/18,346/75,1,0,,,"Hoekstra, J.

   A method of determining the quality of subsystems of an electronic engine control system is provided. The method monitors an engine parameter representative of a subsystem of interest and compares the parameter to at least one quality limit. The at least one quality limit represents an acceptable performance boundary for a fully functional engine control system. The method then indicates, based on the result of the comparison, whether the subsystem is of satisfactory quality. The method is arranged, without limitation, to determining the quality of start time, start flare, idle control during transmission shift, and speed control.
