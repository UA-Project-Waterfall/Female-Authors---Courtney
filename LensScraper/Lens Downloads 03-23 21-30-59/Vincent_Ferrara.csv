filling said gap with molten thermoplastic material; 
allowing the thermoplastic material to harden; 
collapsing the core so that the maximum diameter of the core side walls is appreciably smaller than that of the opening and sliding the core axially from the outer mold section through said opening, and 
splitting the outer mold section and removing the set thermoplastic material therefrom to reveal said impact-energy management structure as a thin-wall enclosure having an end wall, a flange and side walls extending between the enclosure and wall and flange.
