SOLUTION: A high speed jet of saline solution ejected from a circular loop- shaped jet generator (46) or other jet generator located at the distal end (38) of a catheter accompanies fluid into a flow-in opening (34) and generates a cross current jet (82) eddying in the direction of ejection through a flow-out opening (30) with the backing pressure created by the flow resistance of the fluid. By applying he vertical force and resistance of the fluid to a thrombotic deposit or a focus lesion (78) in a blood vessel (76) or in other lumina in the body, the thrombotic deposit or focus lesion is broken to pieces and particles of the thrombus are accompanied into the flow-in opening (34). The particles of the thrombus soaked and softened in the high speed jet either pass through a discharge lumen or recycle by way of a flow-out opening (32).",POSSIS MEDICAL INC,BONNETTE MICHAEL J;;MORRIS JOHN EDWARD;;WIESEL STEVEN E;;BRIDGEMAN JOHN B;;KOZAK DEBRA M;;BEAUPRE ROSEMARY C;;JENSON MARK L;;SETUM CINDY M;;DUTCHER ROBERT G,,https://lens.org/108-658-550-648-790,Patent Application,no,0,17,10,43,0,A61B17/32037;;A61M1/85;;A61B17/32037;;A61M1/85,A61B17/00;;A61B17/22;;A61M1/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING
