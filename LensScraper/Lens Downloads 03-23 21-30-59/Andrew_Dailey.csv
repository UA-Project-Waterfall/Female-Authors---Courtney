In such circumstances, an end surface 209 of the projection 208 increases the available surface area for heat exchange with a cross flow 204 whilst a coolant air flow 206 jetted from the jet aperture 205 can transgress a proportion of the air flow 204a passing between the end surface 209 and a junction surface 203 incorporating the jet aperture 205. By providing a spacing gap B between the end surface 209 and the junction surface 203 it is possible to avoid localised distortions to the cross flow 204 whilst the projection 208 still provides that the coolant air flow 206 projected from the jet aperture 205 mostly passes through a lower turbulence wake downstream of the projection 208 for greater impingement upon a target surface 202 for heat transfer and cooling efficiency. Typically the impingement cooling arrangement 200 is incorporated within turbine blades or vanes of a jet engine such that a multitude of such arrangements 200 are provided in a particular sizing and distribution to achieve the desired operational performance.

A spacing gap B between the end surface and the junction surface avoids localised distortions to the cross flow whilst the projection provides that the coolant air flow projected from the jet aperture mostly passes through a lower turbulence wake downstream of the projection for greater impingement upon a target surface for heat transfer and cooling efficiency.

A plurality of uppermost layers, likewise including a metal foil, form a thin barrier member that is sealingly attached to the substrate's other layers. In this manner, a plurality of electronic components, mounted on the substrate's other layers so as to be electrically interconnected with the traces before sealingly attaching the barrier member, are encapsulated within metal foil to provide an environmentally-sealed assembly featuring improved resistance to moisture diffusion and penetration/permeation of other substances characteristic of the assembly's service environment into the assembly. A filler material, also encapsulated within the metal foil, is operative to neutralize a predetermined amount of a penetrant, further improving the operability and service life of the assembly. Preferably, a relatively-rigid polymeric material is formed in touching contact with the substrate, as by overmolding the plastic material on the environmentally-sealed assembly, to thereby provide a plastic part incorporating the assembly.",VISTEON GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY INC,GLOVATSKY ANDREW ZACHARY;;NATION BRENDA JOYCE;;SCHWEITZER CHARLES FREDERICK;;DAILEY DANIEL PHILLIP;;LI DELIN;;BAKER JAY DEAVIS;;GOENKA LAKHI NANDLAL;;KNEISEL LAWRENCE LEROY;;LEMECHA MYRON,VISTEON GLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES INC (2000-06-15);;FORD MOTOR COMPANY (2000-05-18),https://lens.org/194-335-110-610-775,Granted Patent,yes,16,39,6,6,0,H01L23/5387;;H05K1/189;;H05K3/284;;H05K5/0095;;H01L2924/0002;;H05K3/284;;H01L23/5387;;H05K1/189;;H05K5/0095;;H01L2924/0002,H01L23/538;;H05K1/18;;H05K3/28;;H05K5/00,174/52.2;;174/52.3;;257/682;;257/693;;257/789;;257/712;;361/749;;361/752;;439/77,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
