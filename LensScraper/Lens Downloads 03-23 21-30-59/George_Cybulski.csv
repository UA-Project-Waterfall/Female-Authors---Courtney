    A tension-adjusting mechanism for the elongated earpieces of a stethoscope comprises a neckpiece and, for each earpiece, a pivot mechanism portion between the proximal end of the earpiece and the neckpiece, a spring mechanism portion between the proximal end of the earpiece and the neckpiece, and a tension-adjusting mechanism portion between the spring member and the neckpiece. For each earpiece, the pivot mechanism portion defines a pivot axis about which the earpiece pivots, and the spring mechanism portion comprises a resilient blade deforming upon spreading apart of the earpieces. This deformation produces a tension on the earpieces opposing to further spreading apart thereof. The tension-adjusting mechanism portion defines a plurality of interchangeable point of contacts with the resilient blades, which contact points having different positions relative to the neckpiece.
