Conversely, the user may enter descriptive textual information, and the locations of responsive features are indicated. The data processing and memory storage requirements are minimized by encoding information about the image as a pixel bit map, and a color map in which the addresses or indices of the color map are correlated with the addresses or pointers to strings of descriptive information. Each color map address corresponds to a predefined set of features and descriptive information about those features. Since the pixel bit map defines a color map address for each location on the image, suitable programming of the color map can insure proper correlation of descriptive information with corresponding locations on the image. The correlation between color map addresses and the descriptive information about the features is represented most compactly by arranging or sorting the entries in the color map so that there is a correspondence between each predefined feature and a continuous range of color map addresses.

Conversely, the user may enter descriptive textual information, and the locations of responsive features are indicated. The data processing and memory storage requirements are minimized by encoding information about the image as a pixel bit map, and a color map in which the addresses or indices of the color map are correlated with the addresses or pointers to strings of descriptive information. Each color map address corresponds to a predefined set of features and descriptive information about those features. Since the pixel bit map defines a color map address for each location on the image, suitable programming of the color map can insure proper correlation of descriptive information with corresponding locations on the image. The correlation between color map addresses and the descriptive information about the features is represented most compactly by arranging or sorting the entries in the color map so that there is a correspondence between each predefined feature and a continuous range of color map addresses. Therefore, for a specified color map address, the corresponding set of features and their pointers can be found by comparing the specified color map address to the limits of the color map address ranges for the various features.",DOYLE MICHAEL D,DOYLE MICHAEL D,,https://lens.org/163-774-291-845-572,Granted Patent,no,0,0,5,5,0,G06F3/033;;G06F3/033,G06F3/033,D13750013    M;;3540236    S,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

This is coupled with additional sections of pipe and routed vertically thru the dwellings roof. The heating element creates convection, which draws the air beneath the slab up exiting the dwelling at the roof. At the opposite end orifice a fresh air inlet pipe is placed drawing air from outside of dwelling. A suitable layer of gas permeable material is required under the slab for fresh air to flow. One major advantage of the heating element opposed to a fan is its indefinite life span.

Conversely, the user may enter descriptive textual information, and the locations of responsive features are indicated. The data processing and memory storage requirements are minimized by encoding information about the image as a pixel bit map (13), and a color map (25) in which the addresses or indices of the color map (25) are correlated with the addresses or pointers (27) to strings (26) of descriptive information. Each color map (25) address corresponds to a predefined set of features and descriptive information about those features. Since the pixel bit map (13) defines a color map (25) address for each location on the image, suitable programming of the color map (25) can insure proper correlation of descriptive information with corresponding locations on the image (21). The correlation between color map (25) addresses and the descriptive information about the features is represented most compactly be arranging or sorting the entries in the color map (25) so that there is a correspondence between each predefined feature and a continuous range of color map (25) addresses. Therefore, for a specified color map (25) address, the corresponding set of features and their pointers (27) can be found by comparing the specified color map (25) address to the limits of the color map (25) address ranges for the various features.

The cell uses multiple alternating layers of a dense metal and light metal separated by a mesh of non-conducting material such as fiberglass. The gamma ray interacts with the dense metal to free a recoil electron (to be captured by the light metal) and a somewhat lower energy photon that still usually would pass through the light metal layer. This lower energy photon can again undergo Compton scattering in the dense metal layer, until it is finally absorbed by the photoelectric effect.

A selective switching between a normal large pull-up device and a smaller one in a wordline driver path allows limiting the current in the pull-up circuit to a low value so as to detect shorts because the shorts will cause the active wordline voltage level to drop, while a wordline without shorts will operate well. A GIDL (Gate Induced Drain Leakage) reduction circuit may be used as a pull-up circuit connected to supply a bias voltage to the wordline driver associated with a wordline being tested for shorts or other defects. A test signal may be selectively generated during testing so as to supply a lower strength voltage output of the GIDL circuit (the VccpRDec output) as the bias voltage to the wordline driver. The test signal, when latched, may limit the Vccp current (by generating VccpRDec) to the row to be tested so as to detect row-to-row shorts without disturbing the VNWL (negative wordline voltage) and to reduce unnecessary stress and the P-channel breakdown in the row decodes during burn-in testing of a memory chip.

H., [Doyle, M., and Gebbie, F.]. May 29. Metal sheet, seaming and joining.-Relates to a machine for securing, without solder, lids upon cans in which are preserved condensed milk, fruits, vegetables, &c. The lids when placed in position are hat-shaped as shown at B, Figs. 17 and 19, the action of the machine being to turn down the horizontal flange of the lid over the vertical flange of the can-mouth, with or without the formation of a.bead b<1>. Fig. 3 shows in vertical section the main operative portions of the machine, and Fig. 4 a vertical section through the crimping-rollers, which are alternately in and out of action. The can A to be capped is placed upon the support D, which is loosely mounted upon the rotating shaft E, the shaft also being capable of vertical movement through the lever H and treadle-actuated rod I. The flange of the lid is then pressed over the flange of the mouth of the tin by the roller L, the operation being completed by bringing the squareedged roller M into position. These rollers, mounted on rock-shafts, are operated by cams upon the shaft N, which is rotated through a friction clutch, and pulley from the shaft C<2>. To retain automatically the can-support in its elevated position during the time of closing the can mouth, the locking-bar I is employed. At its upper end, a shoulder P engages a fixed part of the frame of the machine, the shoulder being thrown into engagement by the rearward pull of the link connecting the bar I to the treadle. By pressing the upper end of the locking-bar backwards, it is released when the spring of the treadle comes into action and raises the locking-bar and lowers the cansupport. The bar is automatically released from its locked position by means of a cam upon the shaft N. The cam carries upon its oblique face a lug which, after the locking-bar has been released, engages against the side of the bar, and stops the further rotation of the frictionally driven shaft N. This occurs after the crimping-rollers have completed one cycle of operation. The friction clutch may comprise rings of leather with a clamping ring and nut. For returning the crimping-rollers to their inactive positions, adjustable springs may be attached to lugs upon the arms that carry the rollers. To enable the can to be moved laterally to the mandrel, which is inserted in the cover, the can support is rendered capable of receiving a tilting movement. It is formed with a screwed socket larger than the end of its shaft, upon which are longitudinal grooves for taking a locking-bolt. Upon the withdrawal of the bolt, the can support can be readily adjusted.",MICHAEL DOYLE;;FRANK GEBBIE,DOYLE MICHAEL;;GEBBIE FRANK,,https://lens.org/035-103-460-181-538,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

A selective switching between a normal large pull-up device and a smaller one in a wordline driver path allows limiting the current in the pull-up circuit to a low value so as to detect shorts because the shorts will cause the active wordline voltage level to drop, while a wordline without shorts will operate well. A GIDL (Gate Induced Drain Leakage) reduction circuit may be used as a pull-up circuit connected to supply a bias voltage to the wordline driver associated with a wordline being tested for shorts or other defects. A test signal may be selectively generated during testing so as to supply a lower strength voltage output of the GIDL circuit (the VccpRDec output) as the bias voltage to the wordline driver. The test signal, when latched, may limit the Vccp current (by generating VccpRDec) to the row to be tested so as to detect row-to-row shorts without disturbing the VNWL (negative wordline voltage) and to reduce unnecessary stress and the P-channel breakdown in the row decodes during burn-in testing of a memory chip.

FFA may range from very low, 1% or less, to more than 40% in some rendered animal oils. Corn oil from the wet or dry process of ethanol production may have from 7 to 15% FFA. The varying amount of FFA presents numerous process issues for downstream users of these oils especially in the production of biodiesel, fatty acid methyl ester (FAME). FFA about 1 or 2% requires esterification as well as transesterification for the production of FAME. What is needed is a method to perform Glycerolysis.

The first or last key segment teeth to engage or disengage, respectively, are shortened or completely trimmed, and the adjacent pulley segment to the key segment is elongated such that the inward portion of the tooth profile extends toward the key segment. Shortened tooth or teeth and an elongated adjacent segment together allow for many pulley segments to be designed as key segments. Completely trimmed teeth may be engineered to create a supporting surface for the endless member on the key segment. The elongated adjacent segment may have an extending portion which slidably mates with the supporting surface of the key segment, thereby receiving radial support therefrom. Multiple pulley segments from different pulley segment sets may be connected or constructed to move together in a unified stack, and may be staggered such that any one segment may be in an engaging position with the endless member when the unified stack is moved along the axis of rotation. Unified stacks may have guiding rails on both inner and outer radial surfaces, and the pulley assembly may have mating features that receive such guiding rails. Any number of the pulley segments in a unified stack may be key pulley segments. Pulley segments of a stack may be vertically separated into one or more unified stacks. Unified stacks may be moved by way of a cam or roller cam system, where each unified stack has a slidably or ratably attached roller and roller-arm. Chassis-mounted cams engage the rollers outside of the contact zone, rollers and roller-arms are moved into and out of engagement with the cams, and individual segments of a unified stack are moved into or out of engagement. Rollers may be actuated into and out of engagement by electromagnets, fixably mounted in an array. Rollers may discretely engage with multiple cams, by way of several electromagnet-arrays, and thereby complete several stack axial motions. Electromagnets in an array may be selectively energized to move selected rollers to an active position in order to effect key pulley segment engagement, stack axial movement and transition.",1783590 ONTARIO LTD D/B/A INMOTIVE,WONG ANTHONY;;BOTTERO PAUL;;DOYLE MICHAEL,,https://lens.org/045-878-007-878-317,Granted Patent,no,7,0,20,20,0,F16H9/24;;F16H55/54;;F16H9/24;;F16H55/52;;F16H7/22;;F16H9/06;;F16H9/24;;F16H7/22;;F16H9/12;;F16H55/42;;F16H9/24;;F16H9/06;;F16H55/56,F16H55/56;;F16H7/22;;F16H9/06;;F16H9/24,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The first or last key segment teeth to engage or disengage, respectively, are shortened or completely trimmed, and the adjacent pulley segment to the key segment is elongated such that the inward portion of the tooth profile extends toward the key segment. Shortened tooth or teeth and an elongated adjacent segment together allow for many pulley segments to be designed as key segments. Completely trimmed teeth may be engineered to create a supporting surface for the endless member on the key segment. The elongated adjacent segment may have an extending portion which slidably mates with the supporting surface of the key segment, thereby receiving radial support therefrom. Multiple pulley segments from different pulley segment sets may be connected or constructed to move together in a unified stack, and may be staggered such that any one segment may be in an engaging position with the endless member when the unified stack is moved along the axis of rotation. Unified stacks may have guiding rails on both inner and outer radial surfaces, and the pulley assembly may have mating features that receive such guiding rails. Any number of the pulley segments in a unified stack may be key pulley segments. Pulley segments of a stack may be vertically separated into one or more unified stacks. Unified stacks may be moved by way of a cam or roller cam system, where each unified stack has a slidably or ratably attached roller and roller-arm. Chassis-mounted cams engage the rollers outside of the contact zone, rollers and roller-arms are moved into and out of engagement with the cams, and individual segments of a unified stack are moved into or out of engagement. Rollers may be actuated into and out of engagement by electromagnets, fixably mounted in an array.

In order to automate the counting of biological agents, a biological growth plate is inserted into a biological scanning unit. Upon insertion of the biological growth plate, the biological scanning unit generates an image of the plate. Then, the amount of biological agents that appear in the image, such as a number of bacteria colonies, can be counted or otherwise determined using image processing and analysis routines performed either by the scanning unit or an external computing device, such as a desktop computer, workstation or the like. A variety of counting rules are described herein that can be used to improve the accuracy of automated counts of biological agents on a biological growth plate.",3M INNOVATIVE PROPERTIES CO,MICHAEL PLUMB;;CHRISTINE BINSFELD;;DOYLE POTTER,,https://lens.org/169-560-748-837-922,Patent Application,no,0,0,39,39,0,G06T7/0012;;G06T2207/30004;;G06T2207/30024;;G06V20/69;;G06F1/00;;G06F18/00;;G06T7/0012;;G06T2207/30004;;G06T2207/30024;;G06V20/69,G06K9/00,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The invention is particularly useful in the commercial trucking industry where multiple electronic applications require the identification of a vehicle operator. Each vehicle operator in the communication system is preassigned a unique identification code which is used to request a login or logoff from the validation system. A database of all vehicle operator identification codes is stored at a central station. The identification code is transmitted from the vehicle to the central station when a login or logoff is desired. If the identification code of the requesting operator is found in the database, any electronic system requiring the vehicle operator's identification is notified of the login of logoff event and the identification of the vehicle operator requesting the event.",QUALCOMM INC,SEGAL MICHAEL;;CHESAVAGE DAVID;;DOYLE THOMAS,,https://lens.org/116-498-189-918-525,Granted Patent,no,0,0,15,15,0,G07C5/008;;G08G1/127;;G08G1/127;;G07C5/008,G07C5/00;;G08G1/127,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The first or last key segment teeth to engage or disengage, respectively, are shortened or completely trimmed, and the adjacent pulley segment to the key segment is elongated such that the inward portion of the tooth profile extends toward the key segment. Shortened tooth or teeth and an elongated adjacent segment together allow for many pulley segments to be designed as key segments. Completely trimmed teeth may be engineered to create a supporting surface for the endless member on the key segment. The elongated adjacent segment may have an extending portion which slidably mates with the supporting surface of the key segment, thereby receiving radial support therefrom. Multiple pulley segments from different pulley segment sets may be connected or constructed to move together in a unified stack, and may be staggered such that any one segment may be in an engaging position with the endless member when the unified stack is moved along the axis of rotation. Unified stacks may have guiding rails on both inner and outer radial surfaces, and the pulley assembly may have mating features that receive such guiding rails. Any number of the pulley segments in a unified stack may be key pulley segments. Pulley segments of a stack may be vertically separated into one or more unified stacks. Unified stacks may be moved by way of a cam or roller cam system, where each unified stack has a slidably or ratably attached roller and roller-arm. Chassis-mounted cams engage the rollers outside of the contact zone, rollers and roller-arms are moved into and out of engagement with the cams, and individual segments of a unified stack are moved into or out of engagement.

Once selected the program object executes on the user's (client) computer or may execute on a remote server or additional remote computers in a distributed processing arrangement. After launching the program object, the user is able to interact with the object as the invention provides for ongoing interprocess communication between the application object (program) and the browser program. One application of the embedded program object allows a user to view large and complex multi-dimensional objects from within the browser's window. The user can manipulate a control panel to change the viewpoint used to view the image. The invention allows a program to execute on a remote server or other computers to calculate the viewing transformations and send frame data to the client computer thus providing the user of the client computer with interactive features and allowing the user to have access to greater computing power than may be available at the user's client computer.",UNIV CALIFORNIA,DOYLE MICHAEL;;MARTIN

The first or last key segment teeth to engage or disengage, respectively, are shortened or completely trimmed, and the adjacent pulley segment to the key segment is elongated such that the inward portion of the tooth profile extends toward the key segment. Shortened tooth or teeth and an elongated adjacent segment together allow for many pulley segments to be designed as key segments. Completely trimmed teeth may be engineered to create a supporting surface for the endless member on the key segment. The elongated adjacent segment may have an extending portion which slidably mates with the supporting surface of the key segment, thereby receiving radial support therefrom. Multiple pulley segments from different pulley segment sets may be connected or constructed to move together in a unified stack, and may be staggered such that any one segment may be in an engaging position with the endless member when the unified stack is moved along the axis of rotation. Unified stacks may have guiding rails on both inner and outer radial surfaces, and the pulley assembly may have mating features that receive such guiding rails. Any number of the pulley segments in a unified stack may be key pulley segments. Pulley segments of a stack may be vertically separated into one or more unified stacks. Unified stacks may be moved by way of a cam or roller cam system, where each unified stack has a slidably or ratably attached roller and roller-arm. Chassis-mounted cams engage the rollers outside of the contact zone, rollers and roller-arms are moved into and out of engagement with the cams, and individual segments of a unified stack are moved into or out of engagement. Rollers may be actuated into and out of engagement by electromagnets, fixably mounted in an array. Rollers may discretely engage with multiple cams, by way of several electromagnet-arrays, and thereby complete several stack axial motions. Electromagnets in an array may be selectively energized to move selected rollers to an active position in order to effect key pulley segment engagement, stack axial movement and transition.",1783590 ONTARIO LTD D B A INMOTIVE,WONG ANTHONY;;BOTTERO PAUL;;DOYLE MICHAEL,,https://lens.org/132-520-664-759-294,Patent Application,no,0,0,20,20,0,F16H9/24;;F16H55/54;;F16H9/24;;F16H55/52;;F16H7/22;;F16H9/06;;F16H9/24;;F16H7/22;;F16H9/12;;F16H55/42;;F16H9/24;;F16H9/06;;F16H55/56,F16H55/56;;F16H7/22;;F16H9/06;;F16H9/24,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The first or last key segment teeth to engage or disengage, respectively, are shortened or completely trimmed, and the adjacent pulley segment to the key segment is elongated such that the inward portion of the tooth profile extends toward the key segment. Shortened tooth or teeth and an elongated adjacent segment together allow for many pulley segments to be designed as key segments. Completely trimmed teeth may be engineered to create a supporting surface for the endless member on the key segment. The elongated adjacent segment may have an extending portion which slidably mates with the supporting surface of the key segment, thereby receiving radial support therefrom. Multiple pulley segments from different pulley segment sets may be connected or constructed to move together in a unified stack, and may be staggered such that any one segment may be in an engaging position with the endless member when the unified stack is moved along the axis of rotation. Unified stacks may have guiding rails on both inner and outer radial surfaces, and the pulley assembly may have mating features that receive such guiding rails. Any number of the pulley segments in a unified stack may be key pulley segments. Pulley segments of a stack may be vertically separated into one or more unified stacks. Unified stacks may be moved by way of a cam or roller cam system, where each unified stack has a slidably or ratably attached roller and roller-arm. Chassis-mounted cams engage the rollers outside of the contact zone, rollers and roller-arms are moved into and out of engagement with the cams, and individual segments of a unified stack are moved into or out of engagement. Rollers may be actuated into and out of engagement by electromagnets, fixably mounted in an array.

The first or last key segment teeth to engage or disengage, respectively, are shortened or completely trimmed, and the adjacent pulley segment to the key segment is elongated such that the inward portion of the tooth profile extends toward the key segment. Shortened tooth or teeth and an elongated adjacent segment together allow for many pulley segments to be designed as key segments. Completely trimmed teeth may be engineered to create a supporting surface for the endless member on the key segment. The elongated adjacent segment may have an extending portion which slidably mates with the supporting surface of the key segment, thereby receiving radial support therefrom. Multiple pulley segments from different pulley segment sets may be connected or constructed to move together in a unified stack, and may be staggered such that any one segment may be in an engaging position with the endless member when the unified stack is moved along the axis of rotation. Unified stacks may have guiding rails on both inner and outer radial surfaces, and the pulley assembly may have mating features that receive such guiding rails. Any number of the pulley segments in a unified stack may be key pulley segments. Pulley segments of a stack may be vertically separated into one or more unified stacks. Unified stacks may be moved by way of a cam or roller cam system, where each unified stack has a slidably or ratably attached roller and roller-arm.

A pulley assembly is rotationally mounted on an axle. The pulley assembly includes a core pulley having a first set of mating features on a peripheral surface thereof. A pulley segment set comprises a number of pulley segments slidably mounted in the pulley assembly and arranged in a ring concentric with the core pulley. The pulley segments are individually actuatable out of the pulley assembly into an engaging position and into the pulley assembly into a non-engaging position. The pulley segments have a second set of mating features on an peripheral surface matching the first set of mating features. An endless drive member has corresponding mating features on an inside surface for engaging the first and second sets of mating features of the core pulley and the pulley segments in an engaging position. Contact between the endless drive member and a core pulley defines a contact zone. An actuator actuates the pulley segments between the engaging and non-engaging positions when the pulley segments are outside of the contact zone. One of the key pulley segments in the pulley segment set is a key pulley segment that is positioned relative to the core pulley such that when the key pulley segment is actuated to the engaging position and rotated into the contact zone, the corresponding mating features of the endless drive member engage the first set of mating features of the core pulley and the second set of mating features of the key pulley segment without the introduction of significant slack or tension.",WONG ANTHONY;;BOTERRO PAUL;;DOYLE MICHAEL,WONG ANTHONY;;BOTERRO PAUL;;DOYLE MICHAEL,INMOTIVE INC (2013-12-10);;1783590 ONTARIO LTD (2009-04-02),https://lens.org/030-360-384-273-558,Patent Application,yes,24,21,14,14,0,F16H9/24;;F16H55/54;;F16H9/24;;F16H55/54;;F16H9/04;;F16H55/52,F16H9/24;;F16H9/12;;F16H55/52;;F16H55/54,474/47,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

In a process for anodizing aluminium and aluminium alloys the voltage across the bath is increased either progressively or at intervals to maintain the power input (in watts applied to the bath) substantially constant throughout. The voltage is initially 18 to 20 volts and is gradually increased until the power input reaches the desired value which may be between 200 and 4000 watts per square foot of surface to be treated, after which the voltage is gradually increased as the current falls to maintain the product of the current and voltage constant. The electrolyte is agitated by a mechanical stirrer or by air bubbles; compressed air may be passed through porous ceramic pots covering the entire base of the bath. The surface supporting wires are protected by coating with high-melting-point wax or other insulating material. The electrolyte may be 2.5 to 30 per cent sulphuric acid in water and may contain up to 20 per cent of glycerol or other polyhydric alcohol or triethanolamine. The bath temperature may vary between - 5‹ and +20‹ C.

    A digital power supply system provides a supply voltage to semiconductor circuits. The power supply system utilizes a pulse width modulator to output a signal into a LC filter that generates a DC supply voltage. The width of the pulses output by the pulse width modulator are defined by an encoder that generates width information in response to a propagation delay detector that measures the propagation delay of a first clock signal when clocked by a second clock signal.

The computer-implemented method modifies a series of representational models of the 3D system based on the artifact model generated. Modifying the series includes mapping the properties, characteristics, and artifacts to a representational model in the series of representational models at a higher scale or lower scale relative to the given scale. The mapping bridges a given representational model of the series of representational models at the given scale and the representational model at the higher scale or lower scale. The computer-implemented method automatically stores, in a database, the artifact model in association with the series of representational models modified, thereby generating the 3D multi-scale model of the 3D system.

The first or last key segment teeth to engage or disengage, respectively, are shortened or completely trimmed, and the adjacent pulley segment to the key segment is elongated such that the inward portion of the tooth profile extends toward the key segment. Shortened tooth or teeth and an elongated adjacent segment together allow for many pulley segments to be designed as key segments. Completely trimmed teeth may be engineered to create a supporting surface for the endless member on the key segment. The elongated adjacent segment may have an extending portion which slidably mates with the supporting surface of the key segment, thereby receiving radial support therefrom. Multiple pulley segments from different pulley segment sets may be connected or constructed to move together in a unified stack, and may be staggered such that any one segment may be in an engaging position with the endless member when the unified stack is moved along the axis of rotation. Unified stacks may have guiding rails on both inner and outer radial surfaces, and the pulley assembly may have mating features that receive such guiding rails. Any number of the pulley segments in a unified stack may be key pulley segments. Pulley segments of a stack may be vertically separated into one or more unified stacks. Unified stacks may be moved by way of a cam or roller cam system, where each unified stack has a slidably or ratably attached roller and roller-arm. Chassis-mounted cams engage the rollers outside of the contact zone, rollers and roller-arms are moved into and out of engagement with the cams, and individual segments of a unified stack are moved into or out of engagement. Rollers may be actuated into and out of engagement by electromagnets, fixable mounted in an array. Rollers may discretely engage with multiple cams, by way of several electromagnet-arrays, and thereby complete several stack axial motions. Electromagnets in an array may be selectively energized to move selected rollers to an active position in order to effect key pulley segment engagement, stack axial movement and transition.",1783590 ONTARIO LTD D B A INMOTIVE,WONG ANTHONY;;BOTTERO PAUL;;DOYLE MICHAEL,INMOTIVE INC (2013-12-10);;1783590 ONTARIO LTD.

May 11, 1959 [May 10, 1958], No. 15038/58. Class 110 (3). A gas turbine fuel system comprises a metering orifice through which pressurized fuel may flow to the engine, first orifice adjustment means for varying the size of the orifice in accordance with engine rotational speed, second orifice adjustment means for varying the size of the orifice in accordance with another engine variable and limit means for limiting the maximum size of the orifice, the arrangement being such that, when the second orifice adjustment means has increased the size of the orifice to a predetermined extent, the limit means opposes further increase in the orifice size by the second orifice adjustment mass and simultaneously alters the operation of the first orifice adjustment means so that the engine rotational speed at which the latter restricts the size of the orifice is increased. The fuel system has an orifice through which the fuel is metered which comprises a variable width rectangular slot 26 and a relatively movable triangular slot 27. The slot 26 is formed between a fixed edge 28 and a relatively movable edge 29 carried by a frame 30 actuated by engine-driven governor weights 34 through a collar 32 and shaft 31. The slot 27 is actuated by a bellows 27a which is subjected to an air pressure proportional to P 1 F(P 2 /P 1 ), where P 1 and P 2 are the compressor intake and outlet pressures and F any desired function. To retain the maximum fuel flow and prevent overfuelling of the engine, a lever 105 mounted on a point 106 has its forward end arranged so as to be in the path of travel of the plate 24. The other end of the lever 105 is connected through a link 108 and a second pivoted lever 107 to the frame 30. When the plate 24 abuts the lever 105, the lever 105 applies an additional load to the frame 30 and so to the governor which has to be overcome before the governor can reduce the width of the slot 26 and so reduce the fuel flow. A practical form of the orifice and control gear is also described.

In order to automate the counting of biological agents, a biological growth plate is inserted into a biological scanning unit. Upon insertion of the biological growth plate, the biological scanning unit generates an image of the plate. Then, the amount of biological agents that appear in the image, such as a number of bacteria colonies, can be counted or otherwise determined using image processing and analysis routines performed either by the scanning unit or an external computing device, such as a desktop computer, workstation or the like. A variety of counting rules are described herein that can be used to improve the accuracy of automated counts of biological agents on a biological growth plate.

Then, the amount of biological agents that appear in the image, such as a number of bacteria colonies, can be counted or otherwise determined using image processing and analysis routines performed either by the scanning unit or an external computing device, such as a desktop computer, workstation or the like. A variety of counting rules are described herein that can be used to improve the accuracy of automated counts of biological agents on a biological growth plate.",3M INNOVATIVE PROPERTIES CO,PLUMB MICHAEL R;;BINSFELD CHRISTINE A;;POTTER DOYLE T,,https://lens.org/163-068-785-544-683,Granted Patent,yes,1,0,39,39,0,G06T7/0012;;G06T2207/30004;;G06T2207/30024;;G06V20/69;;G06F1/00;;G06F18/00;;G06T7/0012;;G06T2207/30004;;G06T2207/30024;;G06V20/69,G06K9/00;;C12Q1/04;;C12Q1/06;;G06M3/00;;G06M11/02;;G06M11/04;;G06T7/00;;H03K21/40,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The microcontroller also includes a routine for storing the flow controller command calibration signal data in a nonvolatile or EPROM memory. An analog to digital converter of the microcontroller receives a linear flow controller analog command signal from a process host controller. In response thereto the microcontroller produces an analog mass flow rate command correction signal which is responsive to the stored flow controller command calibration signal data. The analog mass flow rate command correction signal is added to the command signal to produce a translated or corrected mass flow rate command signal. The amplifier supplies the corrected flow command signal to the mass flow controller.,UNIT INSTR INC,DOYLE JAMES HOLOHAN;;UPCHURCH MICHAEL DEAN;;DONALDSON RICHARD LEE,,https://lens.org/193-869-972-170-865,Search Report,yes,3,0,11,11,0,G01F1/696;;G05D7/06;;G05D7/0617;;G01F25/10,G01F1/68;;G01F1/696;;G01F25/00;;G05D7/06,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The invention is particularly useful in the commercial trucking industry where multiple electronic applications require the identification of a vehicle operator. Each vehicle operator in the communication system is preassigned a unique identification code which is used to request a login or logoff from the validation system. A database of all vehicle operator identification codes is stored at a central station.

The microcontroller also includes a routine for storing the flow controller command calibration signal data in a nonvolatile or EPROM memory. An analog to digital converter of the microcontroller receives a linear flow controller analog command signal from a process host controller. In response thereto the microcontroller produces an analog mass flow rate command correction signal which is responsive to the stored flow controller command calibration signal data. The analog mass flow rate command correction signal is added to the command signal to produce a translated or corrected mass flow rate command signal. The amplifier supplies the corrected flow command signal to the mass flow controller.,UNIT INSTR INC,DOYLE JAMES HOLOHAN;;UPCHURCH MICHAEL DEAN;;DONALDSON RICHARD LEE,,https://lens.org/027-429-332-202-525,Patent Application,yes,0,22,11,11,0,G01F1/696;;G05D7/06;;G05D7/0617;;G01F25/10,G01F1/68;;G01F1/696;;G01F25/00;;G05D7/06,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
