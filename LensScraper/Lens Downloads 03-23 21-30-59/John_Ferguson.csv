From the situation of the feed-pipe c<3> it follows that air is entrapped in the boiler. A fire below heats the boiler, the upper part of which rises to a high temperature. The entrapped air drives out the water in the lower part into the overhead cistern, more water flowing in from the pipe c<3> which, causing a slight contraction in the air, draws in more water. This water is heated by flowing over the heated rings c<8>, c<9>, and the action recommences.

[Also in Division F2] A hydraulic motor has radial cylinders 10 with pistons 15 engaging an eccentric 14 through sliding shoes 16, a drive shaft 13 being connected to eccentric 14 and, through an Oldham coupling, to a rotary valve 17. The valve has annular channels 26, 27 communicating with inlet and outlet connections 22, 23, and with arcuate channels 24, 25 which sequentially register with cylinder passages 21. Pairs of balancing recesses 30, 31 at each end of the valve are connected to channels 24, 25 through bores in the valve. Plastics sealing rings 35, e. g. of P. T. F. E., are mounted in annular grooves, either the groove walls or the rings being fluted to prevent pressure build-up, Fig. 5 (not shown). Further pressure balancing of the valve 17 is provided by scallops 36, transverse passage 37 and axial passage (38) Fig. 3 (not shown). Piston shoe 16 engages the piston 15 through a ball head with a ring contact with the internal piston surface Fig. 4 (not shown). The shoe bearing surface 41 is hydraulically relieved by liquid from the working chamber passing through the piston and passage 42 and throttle 44. In Fig.8 (not shown), a filter (57) is mounted in the piston passage, and the throttle insert (44) is tapered to trap foreign matter and to lock the insert in position. Piston rings of P. T. F. E. are either wedge-shaped, Fig. 6 (not shown), or trapezoidal, Fig. 7 (not shown), so that axial pressure forces them into contact with the piston and the cylinder wall. The piston shoes 16 are located by rings 45 and discs 46.

The nozzle assembly has a valve which in one position directly couples the output of the screw feeder to an injection chamber and in another position couples the injection chamber to the nozzle. The path which the lubricating material must traverse is thus relatively short and the cross-sectional area of the path may be kept relatively large. It is well known that oil tends to separate from the fibrous part of the lubricating material if the path is long or the pressure excessive. The direct coupling of the feed to the nozzle assembly thus reduces the tendency for the oil to separate and enables a simpler machine design to be made. Also, the lubricating material is injected into the bearing cavity of an end shield directly over the wick in the bearing cavity so that the wick serves to direct the material to both sides of the bearing cavity ensuring good contact between lubricating material and wick.",GEN ELECTRIC CANADA,FERGUSON JOHN H,,https://lens.org/079-519-960-976-543,Granted Patent,no,0,3,1,1,0,F16N37/003;;F16C33/104;;F16C43/02,F16N37/00,184-26,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Dec. 29, 1961 [Jan. 2, 1961], No. 43/61. Heading F4H. In a domestic refrigerator of the absorption inert gas type, the freezing chamber is formed by a casing enclosing the evaporator and including a portion extending below the evaporator to form a supplementary storage compartment cooled by convection. As shown, the evaporator 14, Fig. 1, comprises tubing having four parallel limbs 16-19, Fig. 4, and the casing 22 of the freezing chamber is supported on the outer limbs by channels 24, 25, Fig. 3, which are slid over the tubing. A plate 20 resting on the inner limbs forms the floor of an upper freezing compartment 21, and the supplementary freezing compartment 26 has a ribbed liner of heat insulating, e.g. synthetic resin, material 27 to prevent excessive heat conduction, the goods, e.g. frozen food packages, stored in this compartment being cooled by convection currents flowing over the lower temperature inner evaporator limbs 17, 18.

Sludge bed clearing apparatus. WILLIAM JONES Ltd. Aug. 16, 1963 [May 16, 1962], No. 18901/62. Heading B8E. A machine for clearing or relaying sludge or similar beds of the type wherein the beds are arranged in rows with dividing walls and common parallel side walls 2, comprises a boom 21 mounting a conveyer belt 22 and spanning the bed to be supported by wheels 26 running on rails 11 on the side walls 2. The conveyer 22 discharges on to a conveyer mounted on cantilevers 23 at one or both ends so that the sludge can be deposited in a trailer 47 or other container outside a side wall. In order that the conveyer may be positioned near the sludge surface for loading and yet may pass over the dividing walls, the boom 21 can be raised and lowered relative to the supporting wheels 26 as by hydraulic rams. To transfer the machine to the next row of beds it is positioned on extensions of the tracks 11 adjacent one end of the beds and the boom 21 is raised until transfer wheels 37 can be lowered on to a transfer track running at right angles to the trucks 11. A similar arrangement with transfer wheels and track parallel to the tracks 11 may be used to transfer the machine from one bed to the next if it is at a different level. The conveyer 22 when lowered may be handloaded but if desired a mechanical pick-up may be provided, Fig. 6, comprising one or two elevators 50, 51 mounted on booms 57 on a trolley 62 running on the boom 21 and having elevating conveyers 58, scraper bars 63, plough plate 64 and a rake 65. The sludge falls from the top of the conveyer 58 on to an upper conveyer 66 which carries it to the conveyer 22. The boom 57 is raised and lowered by pivoting about its top end on operation of a hydraulic ram 70. The machine may be used for relaying a bed by reversing the conveyer 22 and providing an inclined blade to deflect the material on to the bed. The machine may be provided with a supporting turntable at one end in place of wheels 26 to operate with bed having a semicircular end as described in Specification 698,804.",JONES LTD WILLIAM,FERGUSON JOHN MCCALLUM,,https://lens.org/154-797-936-412-367,Granted Patent,no,0,4,1,1,0,C02F11/16,C02F11/16,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The bristles (16) of the seal tend to spread axially and may assume a permanently deformed shape. In either case, the performance and life of the seal (10) is adversely affected. This invention overcomes the above problem by providing a brush seal which comprises a series of segments (20) of bristle material (16) which are circumferentially spaced from each other by a predetermined amount to form a gap (G). The gap (G) allows a greater degree of radial and circumferential deflection of the bristles (16) within the plane of the seal (10) before the bristles (16) are forced to move axially. It is contemplated that good design could avoid axial displacement altogether.",ROLLS ROYCE PLC,FERGUSON JOHN G,,https://lens.org/011-960-671-388-593,Granted Patent,yes,11,56,9,9,0,F16J15/3288;;F16J15/3288,F16J15/32;;F02C7/28,277/53;;415/174.5,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A sound attenuating unit comprises a length of duct having adjoining inlet and outlet portions inclined at an appreciable angle to each other to form a bend and each incorporating sound absorbing material in the form of substantially parallelsided splitters disposed parallel to each other and to the plane of the bend to provide a plurality of air paths each bounded by surfaces of the material. The air duct 1 shown in Fig. 1 comprises inlet and outlet portions 2, 3 at right angles to one another (or at some other angle preferably greater than 45 degrees), the air flow being divided by parallel partitions 4, 5 of sound absorbing material such as glass fibre mat faced with perforated metal sheet. Nose fairings 9 of triangular or bull-nosed cross-section are provided at the inlet. The inner edges of the partitions 4, 5 are chamfered as shown, the two sets of partitions' being separated by turning vanes 8. As shown in Fig. 3, the outer edges 10, 11 may also be chamfered similarly to the inner edges so as to provide a constant mean path from the edges 10 to the edges 11. In this case, the duct portions 2, 3 are made longer than in the Fig.1 construction, as indicated by lines 12, to provide the same degree of sound attenuation as before, but there is a saving in the amount of sound absorbing material needed.

A railway wagon is discharged off a weighbridge traverser 11 by a pivoted ramp 14 mounted between the rails 13 of the traverser the ramp being elevated to engage and raise one pair of wheels, thus causing the wagon to run off the traverser. The ramp 14 is pivoted at one end between the rails 13 and its free end may be raised by an hydraulic ram 20 so that the edges 16 of the ramp engage under the flanges of one pair of wheels of a wagon. Traverser control (Fig. 5).-Bolt 26 is interlocked by safety switches so that, when it is thrust home to secure the traverser at one of the end positions thereof, the traversing motor cannot start and the abutment 22 cannot be lowered.

Input members 15b, 15c have axially movable armatures 15d, 15e so that, when coil 15f is energized, the armature 15d is drawn into engagement with disc 15a, whereas energization of coil 15g engages the armature 15e with the disc. Since an idler pinion is interposed between gear-wheel 19 and armature 15d, the direction of rotation of shaft 14 is dependent upon which of the coils is energized. Instead of the single unidirectional motor 12 shown, two oppositely rotating motors may drive the gear-wheels 19, 20, and the pinion 18 dispensed with.",ENGLISH ELECTRIC CO LTD,FERGUSON JOHN MCINTYRE;;ASBURY ALLAN,,https://lens.org/038-717-917-658-830,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H02P7/34,H02P7/34,A5A A1            A1;;H1S SAA           SAA;;H2J JCA           JCA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Pulse generating circuits. ENGLISH ELECTRIC CO., Ltd. Dec. 23, 1949 [Dec. 31, 1948], No. 33623/48. Class 40 (vi). In a high-voltage pulse generator in which a first capacitor charged from an A.C. source through a transformer is discharged through a load in series with the anode-cathode path of a discharge tube by a very heavy current pulse of some microseconds duration, the tube has a mercury pool cathode and is provided with means to discharge a second capacitor through a second anode to cathode path by a current pulse which subsists for a period of some hundreds of micro-seconds prior to the pulse discharging the first capacitor. The Figure shows a pulse generator for a radar transmitter in which the capacitative pulse forming network 10 is charged to a very high voltage periodically from the A.C. source 12 via step-up transformer 11 and is discharged periodically by a very short duration current pulse through the load 13 via the anode 14 to cathode 15 path of the mercury pool cathode discharge tube. The tube has a push-button operated igniter 16 which strikes an excitation arc to anode 18. In order to prevent the heavy current flow in the path 15, 14 when capacitor 10 is discharged from extinguishing the excitation arc a capacitor 20 which has charged from the D.C. source 21 via inductor 22 is discharged via inductor and the anode 19 to cathode 15 path of the tube just prior to the discharge of capacitor 10. The discharge current of capacitor 20 is preferably sinusoidal and capacitor 10 is discharged at the occurrence of the peak of the wave. The control electrodes 24, 25 are triggered by bias sources 33, 35 controlled by pulse generators 32, 34, respectively, the correct timing being obtained by triggering generators 32, 34 from an auxiliary A.C. source 30 coupled to source 12 via the phase-shifting network 31 and delay network 36 respectively.

The heating is preferably continued until the product has an acid value below 50, the proportions of reagents being such that the hydroxy value is then 50-250. The preferred major acid component is phthalic acid with a -substituted alkanoic acids, e.g. 2-methylnonanoic acid, or benzoic acid as monocarboxylic acids; suitable minor acid components (i.e. those limited to 30 wt. per cent) are castor, dehydrated castor, perilla, coconut, cottonseed, train, soybean and tall oil fatty acids, stearin, succinic, adipic, maleic, acrylic, isophthalic and trimellitic acids. Suitable polyols are ethylene-, diethylene-, propylene- and polypropylene-glycols, butane-1:4-, pentane-1:5-, butene-1:3- and 2-methylpentane-2:4-diols, glycerol, hexane-1:2:6-triol, trimethylol propane, trimethylolethane and pentaerythritol dipentaerythritol and sorbitol. Monohydric alcohols that may be used include amyl, cyclohexyl, decyl, lauryl and stearyl alcohols and oxo or natural oil alcohols. Compositions may include a polyester of the invention, a curable aminoplast resin and a volatile organic solvent. Suitable aminoplasts are methylol derivatives of urea, ethyleneurea, uron, acetoguanamine, benzoguanomine, melamine and ethers of these with e.g. ethanol, butanol, butenol, allyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, glycerol, and ethylene glycol monoethyl ether. Preferred proportions of polyester: aminoplast lie in the range 9:1-1:1. In examples polyesters are prepared from phthalic anhydride and a mixture of trimethylolpropane and hexane-1:2:6-triol or of pentaerythritol and ethylene glycol, and isodecyl alcohol or a synthetic mixture of alcohols.

The rubber may be natural rubber, preferably crepe that has been treated with acetone to remove non-rubber constituents, or a synthetic rubber such as polybutadiene-1,3, or a copolymer of butadiene-1,3, with acrylonitrile, styrene, isobutylene, methyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate, polychloroprene, or polyisobutylene, or an isocyanate-modified polyester or polyesteramide. Antioxidants and ""chain stoppers"" are first removed from the synthetic rubber by fractional precipitation. The polymerizable olefinic compound may be acrylic acid, methyl, ethyl, or n-butyl acrylate, methacrylic acid, methyl, ethyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, 2-ethoxy-ethyl, 2-chloro-ethyl, nonyl, lauryl, b -ethyl ethoxy, or 2-chloroethyl methacrylate, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, acrylamide, N-butyl acrylamide, vinylidene chloride, methyl isopropenyl ketone, styrene, methyl vinyl ketone, N-vinyl pyrollidone, 2-vinyl pyridine, or vinyl carbazole, divinyl benzene, chloroprene, allyl acrylate, or methacrylate, 2,5-dichlorostyrene or ethylene dimethacrylate. The mixture to be masticated may contain two or more rubbers and/or two or more polymerizable olefinic compounds. The rubber or rubbers may be masticated with one olefinic compound before another is added. The mastication is effected on milling rolls or in an extruder or a liquid-cooled internal mixer in which an atmosphere of nitrogen or carbon dioxide is maintained. The temperature of the mixture during mastication should not normally exceed 130 DEG C. and is preferably maintained below 70 DEG C. Vulcanization of the rubber component and/or cross-linking of the polymer component may be effected during or after the mastication by the addition of the necessary agents, e.g. methylmethacrylate polymer may be cross-linked by adding di-cumyl peroxide.

    A search string for searching data distributed among various hosts employing different character encoding schemes or having different case-mapping capabilities is entered in a multi-field text string class. The multi-field text string class includes methods for transliterating characters within the original search string based on defined character equivalence tables. When the search string is received at a data host, a comparison is made of the operating system run on the originating data processing system, identified in a sourceVariant field of the multi-field text string class, and the operating system run on the data host, identified in a targetVariant field of the multi-field text string class. If necessary, an appropriate character equivalence table is selected and a variant of the search string is generated by transliteration. The search string variant is then passed to a search engine to search local data, either with or without the original search string, and matches identified are returned as matches for the original search string. Accurate search results are therefore produced despite the presence of different character encoding schemes, such as EBCDIC versus ASCII/Unicode, or operating systems which do not support case mapping.

A billet (23) made of the material from which the second part (13) is to be formed is placed in the die (20) so that the billet (23) can be formed into the second part (13), engaging the first part (14) at an interface (16) defining the joint. The joined parts (13, 14) are then machined into their final shape. The joint (16) is stabilized by maintaining appropriate temperatures of the materials to compensate for expansion and contraction after forging, and by providing suitable coatings for the materials, particularly at the interface (16). Advantages include reduction in weight and increased stability of a final assembled component because the two parts are joined without the use of fasteners or other conventional techniques.

The leather or plastic material is cleaned by the method without affecting its nature, suede or like materials retaining their nap. Leather is decolourised by the method without closing the pores so that it can be re-dyed. Suitable organic materials include oat husks and cocoanut shell. Suitable inorganic materials include metal such as crushed iron shot, aluminium oxide, carborundum, corundum, glass beads or granite chips. A blasting gun is used, the diameter of the nozzle orifice being between 0À0075 inch and 0À50 inch. The pressure of the particle-laden air stream issuing from the nozzle tonges from ¢ lb. p.s.i. to 300 lb. p.s.i. The particles are from 0À002 inch to 0À060 inch diameter.

Class 123(2) A steam boiler comprises a vertically disposed cylindrical water container 1, an outer insulated shell 2 supported in spaced relation to the container so as to define an annular passage 4 between the shell and the container wall which is open at both ends and means for supporting a gas burner beneath the container for heating the container. The container has a flanged top 1a with a bolted-on cover plate 3. The upper end of the passage 4 communicates with the atmosphere through ring of openings 8. The boiler assembly is mounted on a hollow stand 9 resting on an asbestos plate 10, the gas burner being supported within the hollow stand. The stand em bodies an integral gas conduit 12. Gas is supplied to the burner through a pressure governor 14 and a regulating valve which controls the gas supply in accordance with variations in steam pressure. Safe lighting procedure and protection against flame failure is provided by an ignition and combustion device 22. To start up the boiler, the pilot jet 24 is ignited through an aperture 25, and after allowing a short period for the thermocouple 23 to warm up, the gas valve is set manually to the open position, thereby admitting gas to the burner, the gas valve being retained in position by an electro-magnet which is energized by current generated by the thermocouple. If the water in the container falls below a predetermined level, a plug 27 in a fitting 26 disposed at that level melts and steam flows through a pipe 28 to extinguish the pilot jet 24, a return spring closing the gas valve as the electromagnet becomes de-energized.

The housing includes a gearing mechanism which drives a selector gear. The selector gear pivots between a first position which will actuate the idler gears and output gear in the first arm and a second position which will actuate the idler gears and output gear in a second arm. During use, the output gears of the torquing tool are mounted on a pair of spaced nuts; with the arms being pivoted to adjust for differing bolt centers. Next, a handle extending from the housing is actuated to move the selector gear between the first or second position to acutate the gears in either the first or second arms. The selected nut is then tightened by utilizing the non-selected nut as a reaction element. A known bellows system and torque readout provide the torque value for the nut being tightened.
