By measuring the pressure at the position-monitoring port (29), the position of the catheter tip (26) and the balloon (27) in the pulmonary artery (17) can be monitored, and checked before inflating the balloon to measure pulmonary wedge pressure at the distal port. A right ventricular pressure reading indicates that the balloon is in a proper position in the pulmonary artery for measuring wedge pressure. A pulmonary artery pressure reading indicates that the position-monitoring port has crossed the pulmonic valve and that the balloon has migrated distally to a position that may not be safe for inflating the balloon to measure wedge pressure. In such a case, the catheter should be gradually withdrawn until a right ventricular pressure is obtained.

A thermistor proximal to the balloon permits monitoring of blood temperature in this region and thus allows the determination of cardiac output by the thermodilution technique. A second lumen has an orifice, which is characteristically located in the region of the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium, for pressure monitoring, infusion of liquid media, or blood sampling. A stylet in the second lumen assists in advancing the catheter and, by means of a sudden variation in stiffness, facilitates forming a sharp bend within the right ventricle to press distal electrodes against the myocardial wall which separates the left and right ventricles.
