    A network resource server is deployed in a convergent telecommunications network for providing traditionally service circuit type applications to both circuit switches and packet switches of the convergent network. The network resource server includes a variety of processors for accommodating specific application requests from nodes within the convergent network. Advantageously, the network resource server has a greater capacity than traditional service circuit nodes and is able to serve both the circuit-based network elements and packet-based network elements in a convergent network. For this reason, the network resource server eliminates the need for traditional service circuit nodes and various types of data servers.
