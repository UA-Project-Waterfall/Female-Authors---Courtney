Apparatus for carrying out the method comprises six containers, one for a lubricating oil sample and each of the other five being for a separate reagent. Also included are a reaction chamber, means for transferring oil sample and reagents from the containers to the reaction chamber which may also function as a test cell.",US AIR FORCE,BROOKS JOSEPH J;;DUFFY THOMAS G;;EISENTRAUT KENT J;;HILLAN WILLIAM J;;ROSS WILLIAM D,SIGMA KONCERN (1981-08-27),https://lens.org/128-491-519-665-916,Granted Patent,yes,1,31,1,2,0,G01N33/2858;;Y10T436/255;;Y10T436/255;;G01N33/2858,G01N33/28,023230000HC,1,0,,,"Davis.
