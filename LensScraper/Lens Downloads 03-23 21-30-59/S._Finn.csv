   A scanner for reading characters from a string of characters recorded on a surface as well as reading bar code information encoded in bar codes. Upon obtaining either the text or the bar code information, the information is transferred to a remote location via impulse radio wireless techniques. The character or bar code scanner may include a lens of variable magnification so as to accommodate variable size print. The scanner is in communication with an external information processing apparatus such as a computer through an impulse radio wireless transmitter/receiver. The value of each pixel detected by the scanner is determined by comparing the light reflection value with a threshold that is adjusted in accordance with the values of pixels detected and averaged over previous frames. The hand-held scanner and impulse radio transceiver and impulse radio antenna may be housed in any elongate housing for pen-like use or in a palm-held housing such as a typical mouse. The novel impulse radio wireless interface allows large data throughput while avoiding many traditional wireless shortfalls such as multipath and RF and optical interference. Distance determination by impulse radio means provides for varying the data rates of the communication between the impulse radio and a remote device based on said distance and allows for a warning that the distance from said remote device to said scanner is exceeding a predetermined limit.

The system can include a sensing element coupled to a membrane that are disposed parallel to or in-line with an axial direction of a fluid flow. The membrane is configured to be drawn into contact with the inner wall in response to a suction force caused by a leak. The leak is detected based on a transient output from the sensing element indicative of a stretch or strain on the membrane. The sensing element and the membrane is coupled to a support structure configured to position the membrane adjacent to an inner wall of a pipe. The support structure can include a mechanism that couples the membrane and the sensing element to the support structure and is configured to help in discriminating between leaks and false detections.,MASSACHUSETTS INST TECHNOLOGY;;KING FAHD UNIV OF PETROLEUM AND MINERALS UNIV BOULEVARD,WU YOU;;YOUCEF-TOUMI KAMAL;;KIM KRISTINA S;;HENRY MICHAEL FINN;;MANSOUR RACHED BEN,,https://lens.org/107-133-385-049-971,Patent Application,no,0,0,16,16,0,F17D5/06;;F16L2101/30;;F17D5/02;;F17D5/06;;G01M3/24;;G01M3/24;;G01M3/005;;G01M3/08;;G01M3/08;;G01M3/08;;G01M3/18;;G01M3/18;;G01M3/18;;G01M3/243;;G01M3/28;;G01M3/28;;G01M3/28;;G01M3/2823,G01M3/28;;F17D5/02;;G01M3/08;;G01M3/18,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The method comprises obtaining a collection of cells transfected with a library of variant nucleic acid sequences, wherein each cell in the collection is transfected with and capable of expressing one member of the library, which encodes a distinct member of a polyclonal protein that binds a particular antigen and which is located at the same single site in the genome of individual cells in said collection, wherein said nucleic acid sequence is not naturally associated with said cell in the collection. The cells are cultured under suitable conditions for expression of the polyclonal protein, which is obtained from the cells or culture supernatant. The nucleic acid sequence id introduced into the cells by transfection with a library of vectors for site-specific integration.

The system can include a sensing element coupled to a membrane that are disposed parallel to or in-line with an axial direction of a fluid flow. The membrane is configured to be drawn into contact with the inner wall in response to a suction force caused by a leak. The leak is detected based on a transient output from the sensing element indicative of a stretch or strain on the membrane. The sensing element and the membrane is coupled to a support structure configured to position the membrane adjacent to an inner wall of a pipe. The support structure can include a mechanism that couples the membrane and the sensing element to the support structure and is configured to help in discriminating between leaks and false detections.,MASSACHUSETTS INST TECHNOLOGY;;UNIV KING FAHD PET & MINERALS,WU YOU;;YOUCEF-TOUMI KAMAL;;KIM KRISTINA S;;HENRY MICHAEL FINN;;MANSOUR RACHED BEN,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (2017-10-27);;KING FAHD UNIVERSITY OF PETROLEUM AND MINERALS (2017-10-30),https://lens.org/119-943-872-993-695,Granted Patent,yes,66,0,16,16,0,F17D5/06;;F16L2101/30;;F17D5/02;;F17D5/06;;G01M3/24;;G01M3/24;;G01M3/005;;G01M3/08;;G01M3/08;;G01M3/08;;G01M3/18;;G01M3/18;;G01M3/18;;G01M3/243;;G01M3/28;;G01M3/28;;G01M3/28;;G01M3/2823,F17D5/06;;G01M3/08;;G01M3/18;;G01M3/24;;G01M3/28,,32,19,056-389-287-949-715;;052-134-479-476-406;;071-143-000-702-867;;023-401-369-159-938;;152-495-152-609-480;;123-759-882-105-326;;006-685-281-560-226;;077-643-192-254-040;;001-163-986-531-775;;056-634-313-963-470;;032-910-816-986-911;;065-064-369-251-434;;048-440-520-219-091;;028-009-142-400-833;;147-934-037-842-456;;037-900-691-281-637;;132-147-940-326-303;;149-629-325-231-395;;085-658-372-914-546,10.1016/s1018-3639(18)30596-8;;10.1115/1.2168476;;10.1016/j.compfluid.2011.12.016;;10.1109/tmech.2014.2308145;;10.1109/biorob.2012.6290739;;10.3733/ca.v054n05p69;;10.1115/ipc2008-64065;;25754237;;10.1002/adma.201500072;;10.1016/s0003-682x(99)00013-4;;10.1061/40854(211)25;;10.1002/adma.201400334;;24934143;;10.1243/0954408jpme108;;pmc3251082;;10.1073/pnas.1116564108;;22123978;;10.1109/ipsn.2007.4379686;;10.1089/soro.2014.0008;;10.1109/jsen.2013.2272320;;10.1109/iros.2017.8206506;;10.1109/iros.2015.7354061;;10.1016/j.jsv.2007.07.067,"[No Author Listed] “Plugging the Gap,” (ArabianBusiness.com staff writer) OSI Soft Website article, ,http://www.osisoft.com:80/Resources/Articles/Plugging+the+gap.htm>, Oct. 2, 2007 (3 pages).;;[No Author Listed] “Threats to water availability in Canada.”, National Water Research Institute—Meterological Service of Canada, Environment Canada, 2004 (150 pages).;;Al-Dhowalia, K.

A drilling and production deck is secured atop the space-frame structure. Shear piles extend through the base of the space-frame structure to prevent lateral displacement of the base while permitting the space-frame structure to pivot about its base. As the platform sways about its base in response to environmental forces, the flex piles establish a vertical couple at the location at which they are attached to the space frame structure.

    An optical bit rate for communication systems. The optical bit rate converter converts an ultra-high speed optical data stream to a lower rate optical data stream. In one embodiment, the optical bit rate converter converts the ultra-high speed optical data stream to a lower rate optical data stream that can be detected and processed electronically. The optical rate converter includes a buffer presenting a repeating optical data bit pattern, an optical sampler presenting an optical sampling bit stream, and an optical correlator. The optical correlator has a first input in communication with the output of the buffer and a second input in communication with the output of the optical sampler. The optical correlator produces a rate-converted optical data bit stream at its output in response to the repeating optical data bit pattern produced by the buffer and the optical sampling bit stream produced by the optical sampler. In one embodiment, the buffer has a data input and stores an optical data bit stream received from a high speed optical data source. In another embodiment, the optical bit rate converter time dilates the repeating optical data bit pattern received from the buffer. In yet another embodiment, the optical bit rate converter demultiplexes the repeating optical data bit pattern received from the buffer. The invention also relates to a method for rate-converting an ultra-high speed optical data stream to a lower rate optical data stream.

The optical bit rate converter converts an ultra-high speed optical data stream to a lower rate optical data stream. In one embodiment, the optical bit rate converter converts the ultra-high speed optical data stream to a lower rate optical data stream that can be detected and processed electronically. The optical rate converter includes a buffer presenting a repeating optical data bit pattern, an optical sampler presenting an optical sampling bit stream, and an optical correlator. The optical correlator has a first input in communication with the output of the buffer and a second input in communication with the output of the optical sampler. The optical correlator produces a rate-converted optical data bit stream at its output in response to the repeating optical data bit pattern produced by the buffer and the optical sampling bit stream produced by the optical sampler. In one embodiment, the buffer has a data input and stores an optical data bit stream received from a high speed optical data source. In another embodiment, the optical bit rate converter time dilates the repeating optical data bit pattern received from the buffer. In yet another embodiment, the optical bit rate converter demultiplexes the repeating optical data bit pattern received from the buffer.

   An optical bit rate for communication systems. The optical bit rate converter converts an ultra-high speed optical data stream to a lower rate optical data stream. In one embodiment, the optical bit rate converter converts the ultra-high speed optical data stream to a lower rate optical data stream that can be detected and processed electronically. The optical rate converter includes a buffer presenting a repeating optical data bit pattern, an optical sampler presenting an optical sampling bit stream, and an optical correlator. The optical correlator has a first input in communication with the output of the buffer and a second input in communication with the output of the optical sampler. The optical correlator produces a rate-converted optical data bit stream at its output in response to the repeating optical data bit pattern produced by the buffer and the optical sampling bit stream produced by the optical sampler. In one embodiment, the buffer has a data input and stores an optical data bit stream received from a high speed optical data source. In another embodiment, the optical bit rate converter time dilates the repeating optical data bit pattern received from the buffer. In yet another embodiment, the optical bit rate converter demultiplexes the repeating optical data bit pattern received from the buffer. The invention also relates to a method for rate-converting an ultra-high speed optical data stream to a lower rate optical data stream.

The laminate web includes a support layer and a nonwoven projection web having a plurality of projections which are preferably hollow. As a result of the fluid-entangling process, entangling fluid is directed through the support layer and into the projection web which is situated on a forming surface. The force of the entangling fluid causes the two layers to be joined to one another and the fluid causes a portion of the fibers in the projection web to be forced into openings present in the forming surface thereby forming the hollow projections. The resultant laminate has a number of uses including, but not limited to, both wet and dry wiping materials, as well as incorporation into various portions of personal care absorbent articles and use in packaging especially food packaging where fluid control is an issue.",KIMBERLY CLARK CO,KRAUTKRAMER CANDACE DYAN;;ROBERSON LEILA JOY;;BIGGS DAVID GLEN;;EBY THOMAS ALLAN;;KIRBY SCOTT S C;;BUTLER ANDY R;;FINN NIALL,TEXTOR TECHNOLOGIES NO. 2 PTY.

This coordination may be performed over a back-channel, which may take the form of physical or logical connections between the Decision Makers.",AVAYA INC,BALDONADO OMAR C;;FINN SEAN P;;KARAM MANSOUR J;;LLOYD MICHAEL A;;MADAN HERBERT S;;MCGUIRE JAMES G;;VILLAVERDE JOSE-MIGUEL PULIDO,AVAYA TECHNOLOGY CORP (2001-11-09),https://lens.org/021-280-652-244-969,Granted Patent,yes,113,11,23,84,0,H04L41/508;;H04L41/5096;;H04L43/00;;H04L43/026;;H04L43/0811;;H04L43/0817;;H04L43/0835;;H04L43/0841;;H04L43/0858;;H04L43/0864;;H04L43/087;;H04L43/0882;;H04L43/16;;H04L45/04;;H04L45/123;;H04L45/124;;H04L45/22;;H04L45/50;;H04L47/10;;H04L47/11;;H04L47/20;;H04L47/283;;H04L47/10;;H04L41/508;;H04L45/124;;H04L47/283;;H04L43/0817;;H04L43/00;;H04L43/0841;;H04L47/20;;H04L43/0811;;H04L45/04;;H04L47/11;;H04L43/087;;H04L43/16;;H04L43/0835;;H04L43/0882;;H04L41/5096;;H04L43/0864;;H04L45/22;;H04L45/123;;H04L43/026;;H04L45/00;;H04L45/50;;H04L43/0858,H04L12/24;;H04L12/28;;H04L12/26;;H04L12/56,370/254;;709/250,25,9,006-455-815-898-800;;183-901-701-360-805;;053-963-316-777-495;;037-997-151-679-402;;041-832-919-281-872;;016-243-378-390-387;;065-014-081-533-55X;;006-039-627-250-318;;163-950-432-197-223,10.17487/rfc2858;;10.17487/rfc2280;;10.1109/infcom.1999.749256;;10.1016/s0169-7552(97)00044-5;;10.1145/347057.347412;;10.1145/285243.285264;;10.1145/344588.344609;;10.1145/319151.319152;;10.17487/rfc2791,"Francis, Paul, et al, ""An Architecture for a Global Internet Host Distance Estimation Service,"" 1999, pp. 210-217, IEEE.;;Yositsugu, Ohmae et al, ""Dividing Method for Topological Design of Corporate Communication Networks,"" Aug. 1, 1992, pp. 54-62, Communications, Wiley Hoboken ,NJ, US.;;D.

The Decision Makers may assert routes and prefixes to the routers under their control. This may be done via a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) feed. The Decision Makers, in turn, communicate separately with one another, in order to coordinate routing policy amongst themselves.

SUBSTANCE: method involves administration to eucaryotic cells population a nucleotide sequence encoding, for example, an enzyme mannoso-6-phosphate isomerase when nutrient medium has a compound that exhibits a toxic or inhibiting effect on cell growth, for example, mannose. An addition of reagent decreasing toxicity or inhibition effect ensures to identify and select transformed cells without any danger to kill nontransformed cells in population and without combined insertion of genes that determine resistance to antibiotics and herbicides (""positive selection""). Positive selection simplifies also vector structure used since one and the same gene can be used as both gene-reporter and selective gene.

The laminate web includes a support layer and a nonwoven projection web having a plurality of projections which are preferably hollow. As a result of the fluid-entangling process, entangling fluid is directed through the support layer and into the projection web which is situated on a forming surface. The force of the entangling fluid causes the two layers to be joined to one another and the fluid causes a portion of the fibers in the projection web to be forced into openings present in the forming surface thereby forming the hollow projections. The resultant laminate has a number of uses including, but not limited to, both wet and dry wiping materials, as well as incorporation into various portions of personal care absorbent articles and use in packaging especially food packaging where fluid control is an issue.",KIMBERLY CLARK CO,AMUNDSON JOHN DAVID;;KRAUTKRAMER CANDACE DYAN;;FINN NIALL;;KIRBY SCOTT S C;;BUTLER ANDY R;;ROBERSON LEILA JOY;;BIGGS DAVID GLEN;;EBY THOMAS ALLAN,,https://lens.org/109-744-788-197-384,Patent Application,no,0,0,7,64,0,A61F13/84;;Y10T428/24008;;A61F13/622;;Y10T428/24008;;A61F13/84;;A61F13/622;;B32B3/06,A61F13/15;;A61F13/49;;A61F13/53,,0,0,,,,PENDING
