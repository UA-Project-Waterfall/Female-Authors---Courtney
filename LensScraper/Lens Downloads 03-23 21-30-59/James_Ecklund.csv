SOLUTION: The inside of the inner hole of a valve stem guide 14 of a cylinder head 24 of an engine is provided with a suction valve and an exhaust valve of a lightweight and hollow valve 12 so as to move reciprocatively. As for this superlightweight valve device 10, the valve seat of the suction valve 12 has a compsn. composed of, by weight, 0.15 to 0.50% C, <=0.30% Si, 0.30 to 1.65% Mn, and the balance Fe. The valve seat of the exhaust valve 12 to form into the one on the high-temp. side has a compsn. composed of 0.15 to 0.50% C, 0.10 to 3.50% Si, <=9.5% Mn, 8.00 to 22.0% Cr, <=14.0% Ni, and the balance Fe. Moreover, an inserting member 18 is arranged at the cylinder head 24 and cooperatively receives each valve seat face. Each abutted face between the valve seat face and the inserting member 18 is provided with a nitride layer of about >=20 μm thickness to attain the reduction of wear therein caused by adhesion and friction.",EATON CORP,WANG YUSHU;;NARASIMHAN SIMON;;ECKLUND LESLIE LEE;;LARSEN JAMES MARTIN,,https://lens.org/118-163-436-110-821,Patent Application,no,0,1,8,8,0,F01L3/22;;F01L3/22;;F01L3/02;;F01L3/02;;F01L3/04;;F01L3/04;;Y10T29/49298;;Y10T29/49298,C22C38/00;;C22C38/04;;C22C38/40;;F01L3/02;;F01L3/04;;F01L3/22,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
