   A compact dual aperture scanner is disclosed. The scanner includes a horizontal cabinet including a horizontal aperture and a vertical cabinet including a vertical aperture. The vertical cabinet contains a laser source and deflecting mirror in a lower portion of the vertical cabinet and a polygonal spinner in an upper portion of the vertical cabinet. The laser source directs a laser beam at the deflecting mirror, which deflects the laser beam to the spinner. The spinner rotates, deflecting the laser beam into a plurality of rays. The rays strike a series of primary and secondary mirrors within the vertical and horizontal cabinets, which deflect the rays to produce a scan pattern at each of the horizontal and vertical apertures. When scattered light, such as may be reflected from a bar code, enters the vertical or horizontal aperture, the light is deflected by the secondary and primary mirrors to the spinner, where it is deflected to a collection lens and directed to the deflecting mirror. The deflecting mirror deflects the light onto a photodetector, which produces a photosignal which can be processed to extract bar code information. The location of the spinner inside the vertical cabinet allows the horizontal cabinet to be designed more shallow and compact than would be necessary if the spinner were located within the horizontal cabinet, allowing greater versatility in positioning and use of the scanner.

    A compact dual aperture scanner is disclosed. The scanner includes a horizontal cabinet including a horizontal aperture and a vertical cabinet including a vertical aperture. The vertical cabinet contains a laser source and deflecting mirror in a lower portion of the vertical cabinet and a polygonal spinner in an upper portion of the vertical cabinet. The laser source directs a laser beam at the deflecting mirror, which deflects the laser beam to the spinner. The spinner rotates, deflecting the laser beam into a plurality of rays. The rays strike a series of primary and secondary mirrors within the vertical and horizontal cabinets, which deflect the rays to produce a scan pattern at each of the horizontal and vertical apertures. When scattered light, such as may be reflected from a bar code, enters the vertical or horizontal aperture, the light is deflected by the secondary and primary mirrors to the spinner, where it is deflected to a collection lens and directed to the deflecting mirror. The deflecting mirror deflects the light onto a photodetector, which produces a photosignal which can be processed to extract bar code information. The location of the spinner inside the vertical cabinet allows the horizontal cabinet to be designed more shallow and compact than would be necessary if the spinner were located within the horizontal cabinet, allowing greater versatility in positioning and use of the scanner.

    A gas sensor is created comprising an electrochemical cell having a solid electrolyte layer disposed between an exhaust gas electrode and a reference electrode. A resistor is disposed in electrical communication with a heater and the reference electrode. The resistor can be disposed on a side of the gas sensor; on a side of the gas sensor such that the resistor is electrically connected through a via hole; over at least a portion of at least two sides of the gas sensor; or disposed in a void extending at least from the heater to the pump electrode, such that the void extends to at least a surface of the gas sensor, extends to at least partially through the gas sensor, or extends completely through the gas sensor. A method for using this gas sensor comprises applying a voltage to the heater within the gas sensor. A current is directed through the resistor to the reference electrode to pump oxygen into the reference electrode.
