The method includes preparing a three-dimensional model of the tumor, as well as three-dimensional approach volumes representing regions of the brain occupied by at least a portion of the tumor. Initial paths to the tumor through each approach volume may be determined, and each initial path may be automatically modified to minimize distance through the brain, avoid disturbing adjacent brain tissue, avoid hazardous areas, and use available ventricles, fissures, and voids where possible. The resulting path options may then be presented to a user for consideration, and may be used during the procedure.",ATLAS MEDITECH INC,COHEN-GADOL AARON AFSHIN;;DORRIS JASON,ATLAS INTELLIGENCE INC (2022-11-14),https://lens.org/131-919-029-380-769,Patent Application,yes,0,0,1,1,0,G06T2210/41;;G06T17/00;;G16H50/50;;G16H50/20;;G16H20/40;;G16H30/20;;G16H40/67;;G16H30/40;;G16H40/63;;A61B90/10;;A61B2034/256;;A61B2034/107;;A61B2034/105;;A61B2562/0247;;A61B2017/00203;;A61B34/30;;A61B34/10;;A61B2090/064;;A61B34/10;;G06T19/003;;G06T15/08;;G06T7/55;;G06T7/149;;A61B2034/107;;G06T2210/41;;G06T2207/30016;;G06T2207/30096;;A61B2034/105;;G06T7/12,A61B34/10;;G06T7/12;;G06T7/149;;G06T7/55;;G06T15/08;;G06T19/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING
