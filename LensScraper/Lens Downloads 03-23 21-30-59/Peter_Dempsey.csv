    A computer system runs an applications program generated by an object-oriented software development program. A state transition is made to a state of the applications program from an outside state. All state transitions to the state from outside states are connected to an input of a transition merge point of the state. A merge transition of the merge point is selected in response to the state transition and the merge transition transitions back to the state, wherein the merge transition contains merge transition code which executes during the merge transition.

Each NIU is assigned to one of a number of groups of NIUs. The base station transmits special data to the NIUs indicating which groups of NIUs are currently authorized to transmit upstream messages to the base station, where only the authorized NIUs are allowed to transmit upstream messages. When message collisions in the upstream direction becomes a problem, the base station can reduce the number of NIU groups that are authorized at any given time to transmit upstream messages, in order to attempt to reduce the rate of message collisions. In one possible embodiment, each NIU is assigned horizontal and vertical group words that identify to which group it is assigned. The special data contain additional horizontal and vertical code words that are monitored by the NIUs. If the bits in the downstream code words appropriately match the corresponding bits in the NIU's assigned group words, then the NIU recognizes that it is authorized to transmit upstream messages to the base station. Otherwise, it is not. The horizontal and vertical code words correspond to two-dimensional patterns that indicate which subset of NIU groups are authorized at any given time. By cycling through a series of 2D patterns, the base station ensures that each NIU is authorized at least some of the time. Depending on the number of bits in the code words, a back-off scheme can be designed with different back-off levels, each of which authorizes a different number of groups to transmit. The base station can progressively decrease the rate of upstream transmission by selecting back-off levels with fewer and fewer NIU groups authorized to transmit.",LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES INC,DEMPSEY PETER A;;LEE KYOO J;;WARMINK STUART,WSOU INVESTMENTS LLC (2017-07-22);;LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES INC (1998-02-19),https://lens.org/164-684-074-823-374,Granted Patent,yes,13,12,5,5,0,H04L47/788;;H04L47/828;;H04L47/70;;H04L47/828;;H04L47/788;;H04L47/70,H04L12/54;;H04L12/911,455/561;;455/38.1;;455/177.1;;455/266;;370/342,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Each NIU is assigned to one of a number of groups of NIUs. The base station transmits special data to the NIUs indicating which groups of NIUs are currently authorized to transmit upstream messages to the base station, where only the authorized NIUs are allowed to transmit upstream messages. When message collisions in the upstream direction becomes a problem, the base station can reduce the number of NIU groups that are authorized at any given time to transmit upstream messages, in order to attempt to reduce the rate of message collisions. In one possible embodiment, each NIU is assigned horizontal and vertical group words that identify to which group it is assigned. The special data contain additional horizontal and vertical code words that are monitored by the NIUs. If the bits in the downstream code words appropriately match the corresponding bits in the NIU's assigned group words, then the NIU recognizes that it is authorized to transmit upstream messages to the base station. Otherwise, it is not. The horizontal and vertical code words correspond to two-dimensional patterns that indicate which subset of NIU groups are authorized at any given time. By cycling through a series of 2D patterns, the base station ensures that each NIU is authorized at least some of the time. Depending on the number of bits in the code words, a back-off scheme can be designed with different back-off levels, each of which authorizes a different number of groups to transmit.

    The source code for a computer program contains a plurality of debug output statements that provide a debug output string when the computer program is running. Each debug output statement comprises a fixed-content text string field which is provided in the debug output string. The fixed-content text string field of each debug output statement is replaced with a unique text string number to provide stripped source code. A number-to-string mapping table for translating each unique text string number into a corresponding fixed-content text string is constructed. The stripped source code is compiled to provide stripped object code. 

    The stripped object code for the computer program is run on a target computer. A debug computer receives debug output strings from corresponding debug output statements of the computer program, each debug output string having a unique text string number. The debug computer translates the unique text string number for each debug output string into a corresponding text string using the number-to-string mapping table, and replaces the unique text string number in the debug output string with the corresponding text string to provide an un-stripped debug output string. The debug computer displays the un-stripped debug output string.

    A computer system comprises an active processor and one or more spare processors. A dummy thread is created on the active processor while the active processor is running a current thread, causing the current thread to become dormant. The operating system of the active processor saves a set of internal state information for the current thread into a first memory coupled to the active processor. Each write to the first memory is duplicated in an equivalent spare memory coupled to each of the one or more spare processors. The dummy thread then activates the spare processor and de-activates the active processor.
