The dollar values in the ascending and descending registers, and the unit piece count may be preset to any pre-determined value only once during the life of the non-volatile memory device associated with the accounting module in an electronic postage meter or electronic register. The serial number lock is modified to enable the internal register modification to be provided. To minimize any unauthorized abuse, by an external stimulus or by an internal failure, the serial number lock is tested before each register value is preset.

Each clock of this synchronization system includes a counter (52) that indicates the current time and that is sequentially incremented by a counter advance signal applied thereto. A time counter controller (54) both initializes the counter and generates the clocking signal that controls the advancement of the counter. The time counter controller further monitors the time indicated by the counter and compares it to a reference-time signal received from a reference clock. Based on the comparison, the time counter controller selectively reinitializes the counter and adjusts the rate at which the clocking signal is applied to the counter so as to ensure that the counter advances at a rate equal to the rate at which the reference clock advances. In some versions of the invention, the comparison of the reference-time signal to the actual clock counter time is made at a maintenance operation point (58) remote from the clock. In these versions of the invention, the maintenance operation point reports the difference in the two times back to the time counter controller, which, in turn, makes the appropriate adjustments to the counter and to the clocking signal. <IMAGE>",GLENAYRE ELECTRONICS INC,MARK L WITSAMAN;;DAVID W GLESSNER;;BENZ ROGER;;JOEL R CROWLEY-DIERKS,,https://lens.org/103-507-454-681-048,Granted Patent,no,0,1,14,14,0,G04G7/02;;H04W56/00;;G04G7/02;;H04W84/06;;G04G7/02,G04G7/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A method and system for preserving attributes of objects within a file that was created in a different environment from that in which the file is opened, enabling the attributes to be maintained after the file is saved. For example, an HTML document created with a text editor includes elements such as plain text and HTML tags, with which attributes such as whitespace, line breaks, and indent level are associated. When such a document is opened in an HTML editor implementing the present invention, the attributes of these elements are preserved. Even when changes to these elements occur, to the extent possible, the method provides for determining attributes of related elements that were in the document as originally opened in the HTML editor, so that these attributes can be applied to corresponding objects that are added to the document or in regard to changes that are made by the user. The preservation of persistent object attributes is also applicable to other types of software applications such as language development systems and word processing programs. This invention thus insures, for example, that functions developed in newer versions of a program, although not recognized in an earlier version, persist when a file is opened in the earlier version and then saved.

Each clock of this synchronization system includes a counter (52) that indicates the current time and that is sequentially incremented by a counter advance signal applied thereto. A time counter controller (54) both initializes the counter and generates the clocking signal that controls the advancement of the counter. The time counter controller further monitors the time indicated by the counter and compares it to a reference-time signal received from a reference clock. Based on the comparison, the time counter controller selectively reinitializes the counter and adjusts the rate at which the clocking signal is applied to the counter so as to ensure that the counter advances at a rate equal to the rate at which the reference clock advances. In some versions of the invention, the comparison of the reference-time signal to the actual clock counter time is made at a maintenance operation point (58) remote from the clock. In these versions of the invention, the maintenance operation point reports the difference in the two times back to the time counter controller, which, in turn, makes the appropriate adjustments to the counter and to the clocking signal. <IMAGE>",GLENAYRE ELECTRONICS INC,WITSAMAN MARK L;;GLESSNER DAVID W;;BENZ ROGER E;;CROWLEY-DIERKS JOEL R,,https://lens.org/038-055-181-055-665,Granted Patent,no,0,0,14,14,0,G04G7/02;;H04W56/00;;G04G7/02;;H04W84/06;;G04G7/02,G04G7/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The goal is to determine where users enter and exit the buying process, and then modify variables to encourage trial users to purchase. Trial optimization comprises three components: live messaging, live bits, and live metrics. With live messaging, vendors can reach users through targeted in-application messages. These messages are contextualized. Live bits enables streaming of data updates straight to a user's desktop, allowing businesses to customize updates. Live metrics enables vendors to capture information about how end users utilize products. Live metrics collects details from the installed user base and sends them to a central server which aggregates the data. Through measurement and analysis of behavior, software publishers can pinpoint spots in the trial process where customers lose interest and turn more testers into buyers.",DIGITAL RIVER INC,CROWLEY JAMES M;;BHOSALE SUHAS S;;MINOCHERHOMJI KHUSHRU R;;MOOTHEDAN BINU JOSE;;KOTHAVALA UMEED Z,,https://lens.org/153-620-684-217-572,Patent Application,yes,4,2,1,1,0,G06Q30/02,G06F17/30,,0,0,,,,PENDING

In some embodiments, the isolated Cel7A polypeptide comprising mutations in the catalytic domain of the polypeptide relative to the catalytic domain of a wild type Cel7A polypeptide further comprises increased O-linked glycosylation of the linker domain relative to a linker domain of a wild type Cel7A polypeptide. The mutations in the catalytic domain reduce N-linked glycosylation of the isolated polypeptide relative to the wild type polypeptide. The addition of and/or substitution of one or more serine and/or threonine residues to the linker domain relative to the linker domain of the wild type polypeptide increases O-linked glycosylation of the isolated polypeptide. Further provided are compositions comprising such polypeptides and nucleic acids encoding such polypeptides. Still further provided are methods for making such polypeptides.",ADNEY WILLIAM S;;HIMMEL MICHAEL E;;DECKER STEPHEN R;;KNOSHAUG ERIC P;;NIMLOS MARK R;;CROWLEY MICHAEL F;;JEOH TINA;;ALLIANCE

The original media is created, or altered, so as to contain anomalous locations from which the transfer of data is accomplished at different rates than a standard digital copy would exhibit. One implementation of the process involves timing analysis of the differences in data transfer rates. Another implementation involves the determination of digital signatures during multiple read operations performed on a data segment. The process can be employed in systems that control access to unauthorized copies, or may be used for other informative purposes. Theft, distribution, and piracy of digital content on optical media, such as computer software (also games, video, audio, e-book content), is often accomplished by copying it directly to another disc using commonly available copy tools and recordable optical media, or the replication of media to another mass manufactured disc. The present invention, which helps to irrefutably identify a unit of optical media as the original, and can correspondingly identify any copy made by any currently available means as such a copy, may prevent an unauthorized individual from making use of any unauthorized copies. This offers significant advantages to content creators who wish to protect their products.",SCA IPLA HOLDINGS INC,HOWARD DANIEL G;;PAGLIARULO JEFFREY A;;CROWLEY JOHN R;;LEE ANDREW R;;HART III JOHN J;;MERKLE JR JAMES A;;LEVINE RICHARD B,ECD SYSTEMS INC (2004-08-02);;SCA IPLA HOLDINGS INC (2009-12-17),https://lens.org/015-900-568-384-966,Granted Patent,yes,125,2,4,22,0,G11B20/00086;;G11B20/00086;;G11B20/00173;;G11B20/00173;;G11B20/00927;;G11B20/00927;;G11B23/40;;G11B23/40,H04L9/32;;G06F11/30;;G11B5/00;;G11B19/04;;G11B20/00;;G11B23/40,713/176;;713/187;;369/275.3;;369/47.45,3,0,,,"""Optical Data Copy Protection"" Specification and Drawings of U.S. Appl.

    A bi-directional fluid ejector according to the systems and methods of this invention operates on the principle of electrostatic attraction. In various exemplary embodiments, the fluid ejector includes a sealed dual diaphragm arrangement, an electrode arrangement that is parallel and opposite to the sealed diaphragms, and a structure which contains the fluid to be ejected. A diaphragm chamber containing a relatively incompressible fluid is situated behind, and is sealed by, the diaphragms. At least one nozzle hole is formed in a faceplate of the ejector over one of the diaphragms. A drive signal is applied to at least one electrode of the electrode arrangement to generate an electrostatic field between the electrode and a first one of the diaphragms. The first diaphragm is attracted towards the electrode by an electrostatic force into a deformed shape due to the electrostatic field. Upon deforming, pressure is transmitted to a second one of the sealed diaphragms. The transmitted pressure and the relatively incompressible nature of the fluid contained within the sealed diaphragm chamber causes the second diaphragm to deflect in the opposite direction to force fluid through at least one of the at least one nozzle hole. After a drop is ejected, the movement is reversed, either through normal resilient restoration actions of the deformed diaphragm and/or through an applied force.

    An electrostatic microelectromechanical system (MEMS) based fluid ejector comprises a movable piston structure and a stationary faceplate. A fluid chamber is defined between the piston structure and a substrate. The piston structure  110  may be resiliently mounted on the substrate by one or more spring elements. A fluid to be ejected is supplied in the fluid chamber from a fluid reservoir through a fluid refill hole formed in the substrate. The faceplate includes a nozzle hole through which a fluid jet or drop is ejected. In various exemplary embodiments, the piston structure moves towards the faceplate by electrostatic attraction between the piston structure and the faceplate. As a result of the movement of the piston structure, a portion of the fluid between the piston structure and the faceplate is forced out of the nozzle hole, forming a jet or drop of the fluid.

    A piston structure is movably mounted within a fluid chamber. Movement of the piston structure towards a faceplate causes a portion of the fluid between the piston and the faceplate to be forced out of the nozzle hole in the faceplate, forming a drop or jet of the fluid. Viscous forces that are generated by the flow of fluid along a working surface of the piston structure toward and away from the nozzle hole generate a force that resists the movement of the piston structure. This resistance force tends to slow the piston motion, and prevents the piston from contacting the faceplate. In various embodiments, the fluid chamber is defined by a cylinder structure. The piston structure moves within the cylinder structure. The cylinder structure and the faceplate define the fluid chamber. The cylinder structure and the piston structure are designed to cooperate so that the movement of the piston structure within the cylinder structure ejects fluid according to various design criteria. In various embodiments, a free space is provided between the faceplate and the piston structure at its maximum displacement towards the faceplate.

    An electronic drive system applies a drive signal to an electrostatically actuated device such that a resulting electric field has a constant force. In various exemplary embodiments, the electronic drive system applies a drive signal to an electrostatically actuated fluid ejector that has a piston and a faceplate including a nozzle hole. A dielectric fluid to be ejected is supplied between the piston and the faceplate. The drive signal is applied to one of the piston and the faceplate. The drive signal generates an electric field across the fluid between the piston and the faceplate. The electric field causes the piston to be electrostatically attracted towards the faceplate so that a jet or drop of fluid is ejected through the nozzle hole of the faceplate. According to exemplary embodiments, the drive signal is from a constant current source or is reduced over the course of its lifetime. Further, according to various exemplary embodiments, the drive signal is of a suitable high frequency to reduce the potential of electrochemical reactions or electrical breakdown, or both. The drive signal may also be a bi-polar drive signal to reduce the possibility of electrochemical reactions.

    Structures for use in conjunction with surface micromachined structures are formed using a two-step etching process. In various exemplary embodiments, the two-step etching process comprises a modified Bosch etch. According to various exemplary embodiments of the two-step etch, first mask and second masks are used to prepare a layer for etching one or more desired structures. The first mask is used to define at least one large feature. The second mask is used to define at least one small feature (small as compared to the at least one large feature). The second mask is formed over the first mask which is formed over the layer. In the first etching step, the at least one small feature is etched into the layer. Then, the second mask is removed using the chemical rinsing agent. In the second etching step, the at least one large feature is etched into the layer such that the at least one small feature propagates further into the layer ahead of the at least one large feature. The first mask is then removed. Other surface micromachined methods and structures are provided as well.

    The systems and methods of the present invention operate by magnetically driving a fluid ejector. In various exemplary embodiments, a primary coil and a secondary coil are situated in the ejector. The ejector has a movable piston usable to eject fluid through a nozzle hole. The piston may be resiliently mounted and biased to an at-rest position. A drive signal is applied to cause current to flow in the primary coil. The current flow generates a magnetic field that induces a current in the secondary coil. Either the primary coil or the secondary coil or associated with the piston and the other is associated with a fixed structure of the ejector. As a result, a magnetic force is generated that pushes the piston either toward a faceplate so that a drop of fluid is ejected through the nozzle hole in the faceplate or away from the faceplate so that fluid fills in a fluid chamber between the piston and the faceplate. When the drive signal is turned off, the piston resiliently returns to its at-rest position, thereby either refilling the ejected fluid or ejecting a drop of fluid through the nozzle hole in the faceplate. In various other embodiments, the faceplate is made of a magnetic material, such as a ferrous material, or is coated with or connected to a magnetic material. A second primary coil or a permanent magnet may be included in various other embodiments.

The fluid delivery system has a pneumatic assembly that when triggered injects gas into a hydraulic assembly, which in turn ejects fluid through an external interface. An electronic interface displays various measurements, for example, how much fluid has been ejected and if the hydraulic system is closed the pressure of the system. The pneumatic assembly can also be depressurized such that fluid can reenter the hydraulic assembly through the external interface.
