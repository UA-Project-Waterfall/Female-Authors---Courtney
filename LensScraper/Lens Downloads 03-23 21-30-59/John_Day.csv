Diving.-The shoulder joints F of metal casings for divers are of a cylindrical form, and the joints at the hips, knees, ankles, and elbows are of a ball-and-socket type, combined with cylindrical and knife-edge bearings J, J<1>, J<2>. The segmental bush J<1> is adjusted by means of a screw, and tops are provided for limiting the motion of the parts. Screwed caps K bearing against packing-rings protect the joints, and waterproof sleeves outside the joints may be filled in with a lubricant such as French chalk, lampblack, oil, tallow, soft soap, or the like. Instead of using a lubricant, the space within the sleeve may be filled with air at the same pressure as the water, so that air will pass through the joint in case of leakage, and will serve for breathing purposes. Air is supplied to the helmet A by a pipe G provided with a valve G<1> which is closed when the pressure of water exceeds that of the air, or by means of a lever G<2>, rod G<3>, and lever G<4>. The pipe H carries off the excess or vitiated air. Each arm casing carries a pair of jaws M for grasping objects under water. The jaws are pivoted to a hollow spindle, and are opened and closed by a nut and screwed spindles provided with a grooved collar at the end which engages with projections of the jaws. The helmet is provided with a pneumatic pad or cushion to reduce shocks. The joints may be used in connection with other forms of diving apparatus.",DAY JOHN;;DAY GEORGE,DAY JOHN;;DAY GEORGE,,https://lens.org/012-710-382-860-534,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,B63C11/10,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Classes 103(2) and 108(3) A rear-view mirror mounting secured to a vehicle by a member 5, comprises a body 7 which has recesses 8, 9 symmetrical with its longitudinal axis and spaced apart by a partition 10 through which passes a bore to pivotally mount a spindle 13 to which an arm 4 of the mirror (not shown) is attached by a band clip 12. A boss 22 secured to the spindle by a cross-pin 14 has a tapering portion 15 complementary to the recess 8 and a flange 16 on the upper portion which overlies the upper end face of the body. The spindle is secured at one end by a nut 20 and at the other by a washer 19 which forms the lower abutment for a spring 18 housed in recess 9. The spring holds portions 8, 15 in close contact and urges into engagement the ends of a pin 14 which project radially below the flange 16 with radial grooves 17 in the upper end face of the body 7 which is the normal indexed position of the arm. Displacement of the arm 4 causes the ends of the pin 14 to ride up on the side of the grooves and displace the spindle axially with respect to the body and so disengage portions 8, 15.

The sub-division of the network enhances security by reducing the amount of the network visible to an attack and by insulating the network hardware itself from attack. The fixed bandwidth range at each sub-network level allows quality of service to be assured and controlled. The routing of data is aided by a topological addressing scheme that allows data packets to be forwarded towards their destination based on only local knowledge of the network structure, with automatic support for mobility and multicasting.

DESMO Ltd. June 27, 1961 [June 28, 1960], No. 22542/60. Heading F1A. [Also in Division B7] Relates to a liquid pump for operating a hinged movable part carrying a mirror in a remotely controlled rear-view vehicle mirror device (see Division B7). The movable part 20, Fig. 18, is raised from the inoperative position shown in Fig. 16 by supplying oil under pressure to a cylinder 69 from the pump 61 and pipe 68, the pump being operated by a solenoid 59 energized cyclically by a ""flasher unit"" 58 through a time delay switch 83 from the vehicle battery 60, the switch maintaining its contacts closed for a predetermined time after manual operation. As shown in Fig. 17, the solenoid 59 operates a plunger 62 against the urge of a spring 73 to move the piston 63 of the pump 61 in a bore 64. Fluid is supplied to the bore from a reservoir 65 and pipe 66 and leaves the bore 64 through a non-return outlet valve 67 and passes through the pipe 68 to the cylinder 69. The solenoid is energized repeatedly during a period sufficient to produce a working pressure of 30 1b./sq. inch which is sufficient to maintain the mirror raised against spring action. When the switch 83 opens the mirror is retained in the raised position by the maintaining of the pressure in the pipe 68 and cylinder 69 because of the non-return valve 67. However on energizing the solenoid again the pressure is increased to about 50 1bs./sq. inch which is sufficient to open a relief valve 75 against the action of a spring 77, adjustable by a screw cap 78. When the valve 75 is opened the fluid pressure acts on an annular flange 80 which is of such an area that the valve will remain open even when the pressure falls below the 30 1bs./sq. inch necessary to maintain the mirror raised and when this occurs the mirror is returned to its inoperative position by a spring (not shown). The pump may be pneumatically operated.",DESMO LTD,DAY JOHN ANTHONY,,https://lens.org/086-069-741-056-526,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,B60R1/062,B60R1/062,B7J J69           J69,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A dynamic variable bias current circuit can be coupled to a differential pair of transistors to provide a dynamic variable bias current thereto as a function of input signal amplitude. Bias current is increased when input signal amplitude exceeds a threshold voltage established by an offset or level-shifting circuit. The frequency response of the bias current circuit can track the full frequency content of the input signal, rather than its envelope.

In another device, shown in Fig. 5, a single crank p is mounted on a disc n secured to a shaft m, the crank being connected by worm and bevel gearing q, u driven from an independent shaft by a pinion z and controlled by a clutch x. For a short stroke, the clutch is disconnected so that the disc n and crank are driven directly by the shaft m. For a long stroke, the shaft m is disconnected and the crank driven from the pinion z and gearing u, q. In a modification, shown in Fig. 7, the crank p is driven, for the long stroke, through spur gearing 2, 3, 1 controlled by a clutch 4, the lever of which has two stops which alternately engage a weighted lever mounted on the spindle 5 to throw the clutch de6nitely into or out of action. In a second modification, shown in Fig. 10, the crank is driven by epicyclic gearing 13, 12 and worm gearing 11, the wheel 13 being loose on the shaft m and provided with a brake 15, and the disc n keyed to the shaft. For a short stroke, the brake is released so that the wheel 13 and disc n are locked together by the worm gearing ; by applying the brake, the wheel 12 rolls on the wheel 13 and the crank turns on its centre O.

Central buffing and draw gear; rubber springs. AVON INDIA RUBBER CO. Ltd. May 26, 1960 [May 26, 1959], No. 17956/59. Classes 103(5) and 108(3). A central buffing and draw gear comprises a shell member 12 attached to a forward follower 13 and telescopically movable over a shell 10 forming a hydraulic fluid reservoir welded to a rear follower 2, a casing member 1 welded to the follower 2 and fixed to an intermediate follower 3 having an annular projection 5, springs 6, 14, and a spindle 15 which may co-operate with a separate piston 7 movable in hydraulic fluid in the casing 1. When a load is applied through a yoke to the follower 13, assembly shear pins 16 are broken, and the spring 14 is alone compressed until the follower 13 abuts the end of the spindle 15, whereafter the springs 6, 14 and the hydraulic unit operate in parallel. In a modification the spindle 15 in Fig. 1 may be extended to contact the follower 13 so that the springs and hydraulic unit operate always in parallel. The spring 6 provides a recoil force, but if pressure on the forward side of the piston 7 exerts a force greater than the force of the spring 6 then the piston will move off the spindle and allow fluid to flow through the duct 18 in the manner of a safety valve, thus preventing excess pressure being exerted on the seals 17. The spring 6 is made up of four units each consisting of a metal plate 20 having pads of rubber 21, 22 on each side united through holes in the plate, and separating plates 23 are provided. The spring 14 is made up of six units with annular concentric rubber rings on each side.

The articulated joint is described with reference to Fig. 3 (not shown), the stem 7 having a boss 10 provided with a D-shaped cross-section aperture 13 communicating with circular recesses 15 and knurled conical recesses 14. The portion 6 has a boss 9 with a knurled conical surface 16 to engage either one of the recesses 14. The boss also has a circular cross-section aperture 18 and a polygonal recess 17 to receive the polygon head 21 on a bolt 19 having a shank portion of D-shape cross-section, which is threaded and engageable by a nut 20. When the arm position 6 is not required, the head 4 may be universally connected to the boss 10. If desired, the base may be connected to the vehicle by a known "" come-back "" joint.",DESMO LTD,DAY JOHN ANTHONY,,https://lens.org/110-858-390-977-541,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,B60R1/078,B60R1/078,B7J J69           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A dynamic variable bias current circuit can be coupled to a common emitter bias node of a differential pair of transistors to provide a dynamic variable bias current thereto as a function of an input signal amplitude of an input signal. Bias current is increased when input signal amplitude exceeds a threshold voltage established by an offset or level-shifting circuit. The frequency response of the bias current circuit can track the frequency content of the input signal. A delay in the signal path to the differential pair can phase-align the bias current to the amplification by the differential pair.

The aspheric surface is preferably the front surface of the third component. When the divergent component is spaced at least 0À2F from the image plane, the triplet is modified so that the four components are corrected in conjunction. When the divergent component is less than 0À2F from the image plane, the triplet is selfcorrecting. The two outer components of the triplet and the divergent component may be of polymethyl methacrylate, and the centre component of the triplet of polystyrene.

Lithographic and like printing. - Pictures, designs, or lettering in colours are transferred from one stone or plate to another, or to enamelled metal, poctery, glass, tiles, or other articles on transparent sheets coated with gelatine. These are made by cleaning glass plates with French chalk, spreading warm gelatine on them, and pressing sheets of cellulcid,mica, or like material thereon ; the gelatine and celluloid &c. are afterwards stripped off together. In transferring designs for enamelling, the colours used are gronped as shades of red, yellow, and blue; all the prints in one group are successively transferred, and dusted with their proper shades, before a firing operation, black and the darker shades being transferred first. There are thus not more than three firing operations for any number of colours. The gelatine sheets may be cleaned with turpentine or benzoline.",GREENLEY CHARLES JOHN;;DAY JOHN,GREENLEY CHARLES JOHN;;DAY JOHN,,https://lens.org/074-651-507-400-569,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The filaments, which may be cellulose acetate, may have a cross-section having concave portions, such as are provided by multi-lobal cross-sections, in which the adhered particles may lie to protect them against shedding by abrasion of the filaments against machine surfaces. The particles and the adhesive may be applied to the banded tow (3) at the same time, in the form of a dispersion of the particles in the adhesive, and may be applied directly before the crimping step. The crimped tow may then be heated to generate the gaseous emission from the particles as well as drying and curing the adhesive.

Holders. - Means are provided for interrupting the circuit at one or more places between the leads and the opposing contact surfaces, the circuit being closed by the combined action of inserting the lamp, or the like, and the movement of an adjustable member; coupling or uncoupling is only possible when the contacts are dead. In the lamp-holder shown in Fig. 1, an insulating-block a carries two spring-plunger contacts, each having a metal or other conducting - section b<1> and an insulating - section b. Each plunger slides on a metal rod f integral with a central disk f<1>, which forms an abutment for the actuating- spring b<2>. The upper part of the rod f engages a slidable piece having a conducting - section c<1>, provided with a nut c<2> for clamping one supply wire, and an insulating-section c, the piece being pressed by a spring c<3> which is stronger than the spring b<2>, so that when the lamp is inserted, the rod f engages the section b<1> only and the circuit is not closed until the section c<1> is pressed against the top of the rod and the lamp locked by means of a nut d threaded into the holder. In a modification shown in Fig. 4, having a separate adjustment for each plunger, one plunger is housed in a sleeve a<1>, for example of metal, and carries a metal stem h<1> adapted to engage an adjustable contact screw k threaded into the block a; the other plunger has a tubular part n<1> which slides on an insulating-stem m<1> on a contact screw m adapted to abut against the part n<1>, or this arrangement may be reversed. In a further modification, the holder is provided with two insulating-blocks separated by a spring, two contacts on the upper block being pressed against corresponding contacts on the lower by an external cam-ring which is rotatable on the holder and engages cam-surfaces on the top of the holder; the ring rests on two pins projecting from the upper block, and the lower block either slides in the holder or has its contacts movable by the insertion of the lamp.",DAY GERALD ST JOHN,DAY GERALD ST JOHN,,https://lens.org/127-354-425-868-168,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,H01R33/46;;H01R33/9756,H01R33/46;;H01R33/975,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Deactivation of the adsorbent surfaces of the particles by the adhesive is limited by loading the particles with a material, such as water, which can generate a gaseous emission, such as steam, from the particles so as to open up access to the adsorbent interior surfaces of the particles. The filaments, which may be cellulose acetate, may have a cross-section having concave portions, such as are provided by multi-lobal cross-sections, in which the adhered particles may lie to protect them against shedding by abrasion of the filaments against machine surfaces. The particles and the adhesive may be applied to the banded tow at the same time, in the form of a dispersion of the particles in the adhesive, and may be applied directly before the crimping step. The crimped tow may then be heated to generate the gaseous emission from the particles as well as drying and curing the adhesive. The product tow can be processed on standard equipment to make efficient filter rods from which cigarette filter tips can be made which give significantly increased and selective retention of key smoke constituents.",DAY CRAIG;;TRAVERS JOHN,DAY CRAIG;;TRAVERS JOHN,CELANESE ACETATE LIMITED (2007-01-31);;ACETATE PRODUCTS LTD (2007-07-05),https://lens.org/185-979-914-020-137,Patent Application,yes,19,5,12,12,0,A24D3/16;;A24D3/163;;A24D3/16;;A24D3/163,A24D3/02;;A24D3/00;;A24D3/16,131/280,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The method of the present invention involves generally the reaction of the above-described 4-[1-oxoalkyl]-2,5-oxazolidinediones so produced with a thiol amine having a geometry amenable to forming the precursor of the desired beta-lactam-containing compound or, in one scheme, forming the beta-lactam-containing compound itself directly. This is done either by direct reaction of the 4-1 OOD with a thiol amine (which by one pathway proceeds directly to the beta-lactam-containing compound) or by first converting the 4-1 OOD to its 2-[1-oxoalkyl]-2-amino acid form before its reaction with the thiol amine; and then forming the beta lactam by action of cyanogen).

Flow variations above a predetermined limit are evaluated to give an actuating response if a disturbance above a predetermined acceptable level is detected. When such a disturbance is detected, higher pressure gas bled from further downstream is injected at said station to supplement the main gas flow there. An incipient rotating stall cell will appear as a variation occurring sequentially at the circumferentially spaced positions. By responding to such a condition with a pressure injection flow, it is found possible to suppress both rotating stall and surge conditions in the compressor before the disturbance develops fully.

However, the substrate and the absorber absorb sufficient long wave infrared radiation so that transmission of at least 80% of all incident long wave radiation is prevented, in large measure blocking the transmission of heat energy through the system.",SOUTHWALL CORP,CHAHROUDI DAY;;BROOKES JOHN R,SOUTHWALL CORPORATION THE (1980-09-17),https://lens.org/005-426-378-655-43X,Granted Patent,yes,8,32,1,4,0,Y02B10/20;;Y02E10/40;;Y10S428/913;;Y10S428/918;;F24S80/52;;F24S50/80;;Y10T428/261;;Y10T428/24967;;Y10T428/31663;;F24S80/56;;Y10T428/261;;Y10T428/24967;;Y10T428/31663;;B32B2333/12;;B32B2383/00;;B32B27/08;;Y02E10/40;;Y02B10/20;;Y10S428/918;;Y10S428/913;;F24S80/52;;F24S50/80;;F24S80/56,F24J2/40;;F24J2/50,B5N N17Y          S           1X;;B5N N17Y          S           12;;B5N N17Y          S           14;;B5N N17Y          S           21;;B5N N170          S           1X;;B5N N170          S           12;;B5N N170          S           14;;B5N N170          S           21;;B5N N195          S           1X;;B5N N195          S           11;;B5N N195          S           12;;B5N N195          S           13;;B5N N195          S           14;;B5N N195          S           21;;B5N N195          S           22;;B5N N196          S           1X;;B5N N196          S           11;;B5N N196          S           12;;B5N N196          S           13;;B5N N196          S           14;;B5N N196          S           21;;B5N N196          S           22;;B5N N200          S           23;;B5N N207          S           1X;;B5N N207          S           11;;B5N N207          S           12;;B5N N207          S           13;;B5N N207          S           14;;B5N N207          S           21;;B5N N207          S           22;;B5N N207          S           23;;B5N N21Y          S           1X;;B5N N21Y          S           11;;B5N N21Y          S           12;;B5N N21Y          S           13;;B5N N21Y          S           14;;B5N N21Y          S           21;;B5N N21Y          S           22;;B5N N22Y          S           1X;;B5N N22Y          S           12;;B5N N22Y          S           14;;B5N N22Y          S           21;;B5N N223          S           1X;;B5N N223          S           11;;B5N N223          S           12;;B5N N223          S           13;;B5N N223          S           14;;B5N N223          S           21;;B5N N223          S           22;;B5N N225          S           1X;;B5N N225          S           12;;B5N N225          S           14;;B5N N225          S           21;;B5N N251          S           1X;;B5N N251          S           12;;B5N N251          S           14;;B5N N251          S           21;;B5N N255          S           1X;;B5N N255          S           11;;B5N N255          S           12;;B5N N255          S           13;;B5N N255          S           14;;B5N N255          S           21;;B5N N255          S           22;;B5N N257          S           1X;;B5N N257          S           11;;B5N N257          S           12;;B5N N257          S           13;;B5N N257          S           14;;B5N N257          S           21;;B5N N257          S           22;;B5N N281          S           1X;;B5N N281          S           12;;B5N N281          S           14;;B5N N281          S           21;;B5N N283          S           1X;;B5N N283          S           12;;B5N N283          S           14;;B5N N283          S           21;;B5N N287          S           1X;;B5N N287          S           12;;B5N N287          S           14;;B5N N287          S           21;;B5N N295          S           11;;B5N N295          S           13;;B5N N295          S           22;;B5N N30X          S           11;;B5N N30X          S           13;;B5N N30X          S           22;;B5N N30Y          S           11,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The method controls content in response to a viewer's profile, accumulated viewing time and at least one content classification source. A viewer's profile is provided by a user which determines guidelines for an individual viewer. Content classification values for television are received and stored in response to a viewer's request for viewing a program. The content classification values correspond to television program availability and values attributed to viewing time. The content classification values are categorized into desirable content and undesirable content. The viewer profile data associates a viewer with a content classification value. Thereafter, the quantity of time a viewer spends viewing desirable content and the quantity of time a viewer spends viewing undesirable content is determined. In response to a multidimensional user selected censorship structure, the media environment of the viewer is regulated. The censorship structure utilizes variables such as content classification values, rating value, rankings of rating sources and viewing time credits for desirable material and viewing time debits for undesirable material. Additionally, the method down-loads the content classification values from multiple sources utilizing an interconnected computer. Many sources can be queried utilizing the user selected ranking of rating sources and the user can edit the ratings.

   A method and meeting scheduler are provided for automated meeting insertion and rescheduling for busy calendars. An electronic calendar meeting scheduling program stores meeting automation properties defined for each scheduled meeting. The electronic calendar meeting scheduling program stores meeting attendee automation properties defined for each attendee of each scheduled meeting. The electronic calendar meeting scheduling program utilizes the stored meeting automation properties and the stored meeting attendee automation properties to calculate a conflict score and action list for each potential time block for automated meeting insertion and rescheduling. The calculated conflict score and action list for each potential time block for rescheduling a meeting are based upon multiple factors including a move score, a leave early score, and a shorten meeting score. The action list includes an entry for each meeting altered for automated meeting insertion and rescheduling. The electronic calendar meeting scheduling program sorts each potential time block for automated meeting insertion and rescheduling by lowest calculated conflict score and utilizes the calculated conflict score and action list of the sorted potential time blocks to identify a solution time block for automated meeting insertion and rescheduling. The stored meeting automation properties include a move premium value for moving the meeting, a shorten premium value for shortening the meeting and a leave premium value for allowing attendees to leave the meeting early. The meeting automation properties and meeting attendee automation properties include multiple approval options for moving the meeting, for shortening the meeting and for allowing attendees to leave the meeting early. The meeting attendee automation properties include an attendee role, such as owner, presenter, observer and collaborator, and an attendee commitment options for attending. The meeting attendee automation properties include attendee selected notification options.

The tubing is then lowered into a borehole. The weight causes the tubing to extend through any water layer within the borehole and the collapsible nature of the tubing serves to keep any significant amount of water from entering the tube. An explosive can then be flowed into the mouth of the tubing and down through the length of the tubing to the bottom of the borehole.

More particularly, the present invention allows an ammonium nitrate rich bulk explosive to be placed in a borehole without allowing the explosive composition to change significantly through dissolution of its constituents. The apparatus of the present invention includes a length of collapsible tubing having a plurality of apertures near its base and a weight attached to its base. The tubing is then lowered into a borehole.

A priority can be assigned to commercials which have been made to be shortened or dropped, or an alternative commercial substituted, depending on time limitations. A rebroadcast packaging and playlist are provided. The specifying a preferred play time can be done by one of the following ways: specifying the preferred play time in response to a specific user request; specifying the preferred play time based on a user profile; specifying the preferred play time automatically by another program; connecting a replay timing to other events, wherein the other events includes setting an automatic pause when phone calls come in, lengthening a rebroadcast on certain days, and shortening a rebroadcast based on location of an automobile; providing a radio/television player which has functions of pause and replay which can be selected by the user to deduct time dynamically during the rebroadcast and which performs at least one of: replaying the broadcast; reacting to the need to pause/rewind; respecifying the adjusted time; playing unlistened to material at a later time; and displaying a list of unlistened/unviewed segments. A default play time for the rebroadcast program is used if no time is otherwise specified.

   A certificate validation mechanism is provided for a network interface. The certificate validation mechanism maintains a certificate cache containing local copies of certificates with associated validity indications. The certificate validation mechanism is operable to compare a certificate associated with a received message to the certificate cache and, where the certificate associated with the received message is held in the certificate cache, to associate with the message an indication of validity retrieved from the certificate cache. By providing a cache for certificates local to the network interface, the need always to verify a certificate by reference to a public repository is removed. If a certificate is not held in the local cache, then it can still be necessary to query the public repository. Nevertheless, the verification mechanism provides more immediate verification of certificate validity as this can be made locally without the cost and time of the remote verification at the public repository. The verification mechanism can form part of portal for a network interface.

NATIONAL RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT CORP. 10 June, 1969 [13 June, 1968], No. 28120/68. Heading B5A. [Also in Division C3] Granules or pellets of carbon fibre reinforced thermoplastic resin are made by passing the fibres and resin through the barrel of a screw extruder, wherein the constituents are mixed while the barrel is at a temperature in the region of or in excess of the softening temperature of the resin, and chopping or breaking the solidified extrudate. The pellets are particularly intended as starting material for processes such as injection, compression or extrusion moulding. Preferably the extruder screw tapers in the direction of extrusion and co-operates with stationary screw blades fixed to the barrel. The carbon fibres may be fed to the extruder as short lengths or continuous tows. In examples, 10 parts by weight of carbon fibre are mixed with 90 parts by weight of each of polystyrene, nylon 6,6, polymethyl methacrylate and poly- 4-methyl-pentene-1; 12 parts by weight with 88 parts by weight acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene and 5 parts by weight with 95 parts by weight of an ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer.",NAT RES DEV,PHILLIPS LESLIE NATHAN;;DAY JOHN;;WOOD GEORGE,,https://lens.org/101-214-578-727-667,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,B01J2/22;;B29C70/04;;B29K2307/00;;C08J3/203,B01J2/22;;C08J3/20,B5A AT17P         T17P;;B5A A1G10         A1G1;;B5A A1G10         T17P;;B5A A1G5E         T17P;;B5A A1G9A         A1G1;;B5A A1G9A         T17P;;B5A A1R130        T17P;;B5A A1R214D       T17P;;B5A A1R214E       T17P;;B5A A1R214F       T17P;;B5A A1R314C1A     T17P;;B5A A1R314C1D     T17P;;B5A A1R314C1F     T17P;;B5A A1R400        T17P;;B5A A2A1          T17P;;B5A A2B1          A1G1;;B5A A2B1          T17P;;B5A A2D1X         T17P;;B5A A2D2          T17P;;B5A A2P2          T17P;;C3L LEE           LEE;;C3L LEH           LEH;;C3P P2C4A         P2CO;;C3P P2C8C         P2CO;;C3P P2D1A1        P2CO;;C3P P2K7          P2CO;;C3P P2K8          P2CO;;C3P P2S2          P2CO;;C3P P4C4A         P4CO;;C3P P4C8C         P4CO;;C3P P4D3B1        P4CO;;C3P P4K7          P4CO;;C3P P4S2          P4CO;;C3P P7C4A         P7CO;;C3P P7C8C         P7CO;;C3P P7D1A         P7CO;;C3P P7D1X         P7CO;;C3P P7D2A1        P7CO;;C3P P7F1          P7CO;;C3P P7K2          P7CO;;C3P P7K4          P7CO;;C3P P7K8          P7CO;;C3P P7S2          P7CO;;C3P P8C4A         P8CO;;C3P P8C8C         P8CO;;C3P P8D2B2        P8CO;;C3P P8D3A         P8CO;;C3P P8K2          P8CO;;C3P P8K7          P8CO;;C3P P8S2          P8CO;;C3R R22C5B1       R22;;C3R R22C6AX       R22;;C3R R22D1A2       R22;;C3R R22D2A2       R22;;C3R R22L1B        R22;;C3R R22L2C1       R22;;C3R R22L3A        R22;;C3R R22L5X        R22;;C3R R22L6F        R22;;C3R R22N1B        R22,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
