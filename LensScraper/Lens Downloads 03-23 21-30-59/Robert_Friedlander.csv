    Methods for modulating programmed cell death are provided. Apoptosis, induced by a variety of stimuli, can be inhibited by blocking IL-1 binding to its type-1 receptor. Additionally, IL-1 had anti-apoptotic activity when added exogenously prior to exposure to apoptotic stimuli. ICE cleavage of pro-IL-1 is an important step in apoptosis, and mature IL-1 may function as a positive or negative mediator of cell death.

If the recurring public event is currently in progress along the first pedestrian route, then the processor transmits directions that describe the second pedestrian route at which the public event is not occurring.",IBM,FRIEDLANDER ROBERT R;;KRAEMER JAMES R,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (2013-07-15),https://lens.org/107-462-337-644-87X,Patent Application,yes,1,5,2,10,0,A61G5/10;;A61H3/02;;A61H3/061;;A61H3/068;;G01C21/20;;G01C21/34;;G01C21/3484;;G01C21/3492;;A61G2203/22;;A61H2201/5007;;A61H2201/5012;;A61H2201/5015;;A61H2201/5043;;A61H2201/5064;;A61H2201/5097;;A61H2201/5058;;H04W4/029;;G01C21/3461;;H04W4/029;;A61G5/10;;A61H3/02;;A61H3/061;;A61H3/068;;G01C21/20;;G01C21/34;;G01C21/3484;;G01C21/3492;;A61G2203/22;;A61H2201/5007;;A61H2201/5012;;A61H2201/5015;;A61H2201/5043;;A61H2201/5064;;A61H2201/5097;;A61H2201/5058;;G01C21/3461,G01C21/00;;H04W4/029,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

   A system and method for implementing technical change in an organization having multiple hierarchies. Specifically, the present invention provides an analysis system that predicts a response to technical change. Based on the response, corrective actions can be implemented to minimize or eliminate any adverse reaction to the change. To predict the response, the analysis system will query selected hierarchies in the organization. Based on a set of responses to the queries, a baseline response is determined. The baseline line response is then quantified into a raw score and modified to yield a skill score. The skill score is then compared to a required or normal score to determine any difference between the two. Based on the difference, the potential response to the technical change can be determined.

Quantitative information describing diagnostic characteristics associated with a patient is generated based on an analysis of a set of patient scans. The quantitative information comprises a set of indictors associated with regions of interest in the set of scans for the patient. The set of indicators of potential neuropsychiatric conditions is compared with a set of diagnostic signatures. A diagnostic signature comprises a set of indicators of a known neuropsychiatric condition. Matching signatures are identified. A matching signature is a diagnostic signature that corresponds to at least one indicator in the set of indicators to form a set of signatures. A diagnosis associated with each signature in the set of signatures is identified to form a set of potential diagnoses. The set of potential diagnoses is presented with links to relevant portion of the medical literature.

Multiple upstream subcomponents in a complex stream computer system generate multiple outputs, which are used as inputs to a downstream subcomponent, wherein the multiple upstream subcomponents execute upstream computational processes. Each upstream computational process is examined to determine an accuracy of each identified output. An accuracy value is assigned to each of the multiple outputs from the upstream subcomponents, and weighting values are assigned to each of the inputs to the downstream subcomponent. If using the accuracy values and weighting values fails to adjust the downstream subcomponent to meet a predefined trustworthiness level for making a first type of prediction, then a new downstream computational process that produces a different second type of prediction is executed.",IBM,FRIEDLANDER ROBERT R;;KRAEMER JAMES R;;NOWAK JUSTYNA M;;WOODWARD ELIZABETH V,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (2014-10-15),https://lens.org/050-686-668-179-657,Granted Patent,yes,16,3,16,16,0,G06F11/0706;;G06F11/079;;G06F11/0706;;G06F11/0793;;G06F11/0721;;G06F11/0706;;G06F11/079;;G06F11/0751,G06F11/00;;G06F11/07,,4,1,097-802-510-646-527,10.1109/tc.2009.31,"S.

The probabilistic inference is derived from the logical hierarchy using Bayesian statistics to infer a probabilistic event based upon a characteristic of the data in a hierarchy of synthetic events. The logical hierarchy of a set of a plurality of synthetic events is related by at least one characteristic of data is built by accessing a first set of data. The first set of data is organized based on a first characteristic. A second set of data different than the first set of data is accessed. A second set of data based is organized based on a second characteristic. The first characteristic and the second characteristic are processed to generate a synthetic event.

Each upstream computational process is examined to determine an accuracy of each identified output. An accuracy value is assigned to each of the multiple outputs from the upstream subcomponents, and weighting values are assigned to each of the inputs to the downstream subcomponent.

A displayed appearance of the particular context-based conformed dimensional data gravity well is dynamically adjusted according to how many parsed synthetic context-based objects are pulled into the particular context-based conformed dimensional data gravity well.",IBM,ADAMS SAMUEL S;;FRIEDLANDER ROBERT R;;KRAEMER JAMES R;;LINTON JEB R,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (2013-01-31),https://lens.org/152-229-072-251-00X,Granted Patent,yes,259,0,6,6,0,G06F16/285;;G06F16/22;;G06F16/93;;G06F16/283;;G06F16/9535;;G06F16/24568;;G06F16/24575;;G06F40/211;;G06F16/285;;G06F16/22;;G06F16/93;;G06F16/283;;G06F16/9535;;G06F16/24568;;G06F16/24575;;G06F40/211;;G06N7/01,G06F17/27;;G06F17/30;;G06N7/00,,69,12,116-080-530-899-666;;000-147-296-169-020;;087-116-523-847-368;;009-996-196-111-044;;076-871-825-708-945;;043-482-777-032-437;;109-503-174-896-853;;136-423-970-618-618;;003-520-520-466-313;;052-950-576-928-801;;015-728-452-794-582;;005-550-786-508-453,10.1007/s12559-009-9009-8;;10.1109/mdt.2010.25;;10.1016/j.patcog.2004.04.011;;10.1007/s10207-011-0139-0;;10.1145/1243418.1243429;;10.1109/icde.2009.87;;10.1145/1322432.1322433;;10.1007/s11277-011-0384-6;;10.1049/ic:19970126;;10.1145/1189740.1189742;;10.2218/ijdc.v2i1.21;;10.1145/2009916.2010028,"U.S. Appl.

A non-contextual data object is associated with a context object, which comports with a predetermined set of constraints, to define a synthetic context-based object, where the non-contextual data object ambiguously relates to multiple subject-matters, and where the context object provides a context that identifies a specific subject-matter, from the multiple subject-matters, of the non-contextual data object. The synthetic context-based object is then associated with at least one specific data store, which includes data that is associated with data contained in the non-contextual data object and the context object. A request for a data store that is associated with the synthetic context-based object results in the return of at least one data store that is associated with the synthetic context-based object.",IBM,ADAMS SAMUEL S;;FRIEDLANDER ROBERT R;;GERKEN III JOHN K;;KRAEMER JAMES R;;VARKER PHILIP R,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (2013-04-08),https://lens.org/040-587-915-294-219,Patent Application,yes,5,2,4,4,0,G06F16/78;;G06F16/26;;G06F16/78,G06F17/30,707/776;;707/758,0,0,,,,INACTIVE
