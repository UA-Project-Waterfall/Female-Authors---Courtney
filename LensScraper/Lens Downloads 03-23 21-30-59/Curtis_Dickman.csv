   A plating system for stabilization of a bony segment includes a plate engageable to at least first and second bony elements. For spinal stabilization, the plate is attached at least to first and second vertebrae with at least one bone fastener in each vertebra. Retaining members are attachable to the plate to prevent the bone fasteners from backing out of the plate. One retaining member is a variable retaining member that allows the bone fasteners to toggle in the plate without interference. A second retaining member is a fixed retaining member that fixes the bone fasteners relative to the plate.
