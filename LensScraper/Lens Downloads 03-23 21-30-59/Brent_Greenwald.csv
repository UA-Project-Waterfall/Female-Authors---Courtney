Blocking desorption sites on the surface of a metallic structure increases the partial hydrogen/deuterium pressure when the absorption and desorption processes reach an equilibrium. The higher the number of desorption sites that are blocked, the higher the equilibrium pressure can be reached for attaining a higher hydrogen loading ratio. Moreover, since hydrogen desorption occurs at grain boundaries, reducing grain boundaries is conducive to reducing the hydrogen desorption rate. Methods and apparatus for increasing grain sizes to reduce grain boundaries are also disclosed.",IH IP HOLDINGS LTD,BURGESS DARREN R;;GREENWALD MICHAEL RAYMOND;;BARBEE BRENT W,,https://lens.org/016-116-346-558-294,Patent Application,no,0,0,10,10,0,B32B15/00;;C01B3/0026;;Y02E60/36;;C01B3/08;;B01J20/0225;;B01J20/3204;;B01J20/3225;;B01J20/3236;;B32B15/018;;C01B3/0026;;C03C17/09;;C03C2217/254;;C03C2218/154;;C03C2218/32;;C23C14/16;;C23C14/165;;C23C14/185;;C23C14/24;;C23C14/34;;C23C14/5806;;C30B23/025;;C30B23/08;;C30B29/10;;C30B33/02,C01B3/00;;B32B15/00;;B32B33/00;;C01B3/06;;C01B3/08,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
