    A method for determining a mapping between coordinates relative to a body and corresponding coordinates in a three-dimensional image of the body in stereotactic surgery. The method includes attaching an instrumented pointing device to the body, for example, attaching the pointing device directly to a skull. The pointing device includes an arm and an instrumented joint for coupling the arm to the body and for generating a position signal encoding a position of the arm relative to the joint. The method includes positioning the arm at each of a plurality of known points on the body, each of the known points corresponding to a known location in the three-dimensional image, and generating the position signal when the arm is positioned at each of the known points. The method then includes determining from the position signals and the known locations of the points in the three-dimensional image a mapping between a coordinate system that is fixed relative to the anchor and a coordinate system of the three-dimensional image.

The mounting base of the guidance fixture is attached to the body and a location of the mounting base in a three-dimensional image of the body is determined, for example, using a remote sensing device, such as a camera, and tracking markers, such as LEDs, attached to the guidance fixture. Sensor signals encoding the orientation of the constrained trajectory and encoding a position of the surgical instrument along the constrained trajectory are generated and transmitted from the guidance fixture. An adjustment control signal is received and the orientation of the constrained trajectory relative to the mounting base is adjusted in response to the received adjustment control signal.

    A method and apparatus for positioning a surgical instrument during stereotactic surgery on a body, for example, during spinal surgery or general surgery. A mounting device is attached to a bone structure of the body, for example, by attaching a rail to the spine for spinal surgery. In spinal surgery, the rail is attached to the spine by clamping the rail to two spinous processes and adjusting the separation of the two spinous processes to match the separation of the two processes in three-dimensional scanned image, thereby matching a curvature of the spine with a corresponding curvature of the spine in the image. Multiple of fiducial points are located on the body in relation to the mounting device. An adjustable guidance fixture that includes an instrument guide for guiding the surgical instrument along a constrained trajectory relative to the instrument guide is attached to the mounting device.

   A method and apparatus for positioning a surgical instrument during stereotactic surgery on a body, for example, during spinal surgery or general surgery. A mounting device is attached to a bone structure of the body, for example, by attaching a rail to the spine for spinal surgery, or a mounting plate and a rod attached to the mounting plate. In spinal surgery, the rail is attached to the spine by clamping the rail to two spinous processes and adjusting the separation of the two spinous processes to match the separation of the two processes in three-dimensional scanned image, thereby matching a curvature of the spine with a corresponding curvature of the spine in the image. Multiple of fiducial points are located on the body in relation to the mounting device. An adjustable guidance fixture that includes an instrument guide for guiding the surgical instrument along a constrained trajectory relative to the instrument guide is attached to the mounting device. A location and orientation of the instrument guide is tracked and a position of the constrained trajectory in the three-dimensional image is computed. The guidance fixture is adjusted relative to the mounting device using a first constrained motion followed by a second constrained motion, so that the constrained trajectory of the instrument guide passes through the target.

The method includes attaching multiple bone anchors to the body, attaching scanning markers to each of the bone anchors, and scanning the body to form a three-dimensional image of the body. Images of the scanning markers are formed in the three-dimensional image and the locations of the images of the scanning markers in the three-dimensional image are determined, for example, by a human operator identifying the locations on a computer display of the image. The method then involves attaching a number of sensing devices, such as cameras, or microphones, to the bone anchors. For example, a mounting rod is attached to each of the bone anchors and each mounting rod supports one of the sensing devices. The mounted sensing devices are in a predetermined geometric relationship with the bone anchors. The instrument, which includes a tracking marker, is positioned in the field of view of the sensing devices. The location of the tracking marker in relation to the bone anchors is determined using signal provided by the sensing devices, such as camera images, and using the known geometric relationship between the cameras and the bone anchors, and can be continuously displaying the location of the instrument in conjunction with a view of three-dimensional image.",NEUTAR LLC,FRANCK JOEL I;;HAER FREDERICK C;;FRANKLIN RONALD J,NEUTAR L.L.C (2002-05-16),https://lens.org/170-240-090-191-610,Granted Patent,yes,80,156,1,8,0,A61B2090/3983;;A61B2034/2055;;A61B2034/2068;;A61B2034/2072;;A61B2090/3945;;A61B2090/3979;;A61B34/20;;A61B90/11;;A61B2034/107;;A61B34/20;;A61B2090/3983;;A61B2090/3979;;A61B2090/3945;;A61B2034/2055;;A61B2034/2068;;A61B2034/2072;;A61B90/11;;A61B2034/107,A61B19/00,600/429,4,2,052-870-816-094-691;;068-273-224-393-01X,10.1016/s1042-3680(18)30385-1;;8726434;;7923044;;10.1016/0895-6111(94)90049-3,"Bucholz et al., ""Intraoperative Localization using a three dimensional optical digitizer,"" Proceedings of Clinical Application of Modern Imaging Technology, SPIE, 1894:312-322, 1993.;;Foley et al., ""Image-Guided Spine Surgery,"" Clinical Frontiers of Interactive Image-Guided Neurosurgery, 7(2):171-186, 1996.;;Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery, textbook: chapters 1, 3, 4-5, 13, 18-19, 21-22, 24-26, 40, 43, 214-215; Gildenberg and Tasker, editors; McGraw-Hill, 1997.;;Smith et al., ""The Neurostation(TM)-A Highly Accurate, Minimally Invasive Solution to Frameless Stereotactic Neurosurgery,"" Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics, 1994.",EXPIRED

According to the invention, the additive is a hyperbranched polymer which is functionalised by R<2> radicals, R<2> being a radical of the following type: substituted or non-substituted hydrocarbon, of the silicon type, linear or branched alkyl, aromatic, arylalkyl, alkylaryl or cycloaliphatic, which can comprise one or more unsaturations and/or one or more heteroatoms. Preferably, the composition does not contain hyperbranched polymers which produce therein a reduction in the molar mass of matrix M which is greater than or equal to 7% in relation to a sample composition which comprises matrix M but which does not contain hyperbranched polymer additive(s). Said mass measurement is taken preferably using a predetermined protocol P.
