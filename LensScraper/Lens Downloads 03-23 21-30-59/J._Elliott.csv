The in vivo measuring apparatus includes a hollow tube which is filled with an electrolyte solution and is sealed at an open end by a fiber seal. A plurality of electrodes are disposed about the tube, extend to a location adjacent the open end of the tube and are coated with electrical insulation except at that location. For an in vivo measurement, the tube and electrode can be placed within the hollow interior of a disposable syringe needle so that the open end of the tube is adjacent the opening in the needle and thus, after the needle is inserted, the in vivo solution electrically couples the electrodes to the electrolyte in the hollow tube. After each measurement, the tube and electrodes can be sterilized by placing them in a housing which has a chamber and some means for introducing sterilizing gas into the chamber. In one embodiment, the housing has an inner chamber for receiving a needle or other medical tool so that it is sealed within and an outer chamber containing a quantity of sterilizing gas under a pressure above atmospheric. A valve communicates the two chambers and is actuable to permit gas to pass from the outer to the inner chamber to sterilize the tool. In a further embodiment, a glass vial is disposed within the chamber and can be broken by pinching the housing to liberate the sterilizing gas. In a third embodiment, the sterilizing gas can be injected into the sealed chamber from an exterior source. In yet another embodiment, a glass vial having a narrow neck is disposed within a partially flexible tube preferably with the neck away from the inserted needle. The neck can be manually broken by pinching the tube to release a sterilizing gas with the broken tip held away from the needle.",ANGELICA ELLIOTT,ELLIOTT J,,https://lens.org/061-079-617-631-206,Granted Patent,no,9,11,1,1,0,A61B5/14542;;A61B5/14542;;A61B1/121;;A61B1/121;;A61B5/1473;;A61B5/1473;;A61L2/206;;A61L2/206,A61B1/12;;A61B5/00;;A61L2/20,128-002.1 E,1,1,009-315-802-510-576,5431636;;10.1109/tbme.1970.4502738,"Wise et al., IEEE Transactions on Bio Medical Engineering , Vol. BME 17, No. 3, July, 1970, pp. 238 247.",EXPIRED

   A system for treating tissue includes a probe assembly having a cannula, a shaft, and one or more needle electrodes. The shaft has a distal end, a proximal end, and a lumen extending between the distal and proximal ends of the shaft, and is slidable within the lumen of the cannula. Each needle electrode has a lumen that may be placed in communication with a port at a proximal end of the probe assembly, and is configured to deliver an occlusive element to a site. The system may further include an embolization actuator for delivering the occlusive element. A method of treating tissue includes placing an electrode at a site of a treatment region, occluding at least a part of a vessel located adjacent the site by delivering an occlusion element from an electrode, and delivering ablation energy to the site while the vessel is at least partially occluded.

The inverter switching transistors drive the two halves of the transformer's center-tapped primary winding on alternate half-cycles under the control of a feedback winding which is wound on the saturable core. A non-saturating core about which the primary winding is wound, and a capacitor connected in parallel with both halves of the primary winding, protects the switching transistors against transients, prevents the saturating core from going into hard saturation, and efficiently transfers energy stored in the leakage inductance of the primary winding from half-cycle to half-cycle. A second non-saturating core about which the secondary winding is wound contributes additional self-inductance to the output circuit to limit output currents to a safe value, allowing the inverter to be operated safely with short-circuited output terminals or an electron discharge lamp, which exhibits dynamic negative resistance. Control windings on the two non-saturating cores and serially connected with a variable impedance are used to control and/or regulate the magnitude of electrical energy delivered to the load.

The inverter, which is particularly suited for operating fluorescent or high-intensity discharge (H.I.D.) lamps, includes switching transistors which drive the two halves of the transformer's center-tapped primary winding on alternate half-cycles under the control of a feedback winding which is wound on the saturable core. The addition of a non-saturing core about which the primary winding is wound, and a capacitor connected in parallel with both halves of the primary winding, protects the switching transistors against transients, prevents the saturating core from going into hard saturation, and efficiently transfers energy stored in the leakage inductance of the primary winding from half-cycle to half-cycle. A second non-saturing core about which the secondary winding is wound contributes additional self-inductance to the output circuit to limit output currents to a safe value, allowing the inverter to be operated safely with short-circuited output terminals or a load, such as an electron discharge lamp, which exhibits dynamic negative resistance characteristics. Control windings wound on the two non-saturating cores and serially connected with a variable impedance may be used to control and/or regulate the magnitude of electrical energy delivered to the load. The multicore transformer is assembled by means of bobbin wound primary and secondary windings through which the center leg of ferrite E-core shapes may be inserted to provide the desired saturating and non-saturating flux paths.",QUIETLITE INT LTD,ELLIOTT WILLIAM J,,https://lens.org/177-525-388-762-31X,Patent Application,yes,4,7,2,3,0,H05B41/2822;;Y02B20/00,H05B41/282,G3U UAD1          ADI;;G3U UAD9          AD9;;G3U U208          AD9;;G3U U210          ADI;;G3U U210          AD9;;G3U U301          ADI;;H1T T1C           T;;H1T T1C           TCA;;H1T T7A1          T;;H1T T7A1          TCA;;H1T T7A11         T;;H1T T7A11         TCA;;H1T T7A13         T;;H1T T7A13         TCA;;H1T T7A3          T;;H1T T7A8          T;;H1T T7A9          T;;H1T T7A9          TCA;;H1T T7C1A         TCA;;H1T T7C5          T;;H1T T7C5          TCA;;H2H HB8           LD51;;H2H HB8           LD59;;H2H HB8           LD631;;H2H HLD51         LD51;;H2H HLD59         LD59;;H2H HLD631        LD631;;H2H H23G          LD51;;H2H H23G          LD59;;H2H H23G          LD631;;H2H H23Y          LD51;;H2H H23Y          LD59;;H2H H23Y          LD631;;H2H H25G          LD51;;H2H H25G          LD59;;H2H H25G          LD631;;H2H H25Y          LD51;;H2H H25Y          LD59;;H2H H25Y          LD631;;H2H H7B           LD59;;H2H H7B           LD631;;H2H H72           LD631;;H3P PSX           PSX;;H3T TS            TS (B);;H3T T2RX          TS (B);;H3T T2R1          TS (B);;H3T T2W2          TS (B);;H3T T2W3          TS (B);;H3T T5P           TS (B);;U1S S1925,1,1,077-410-622-791-704,10.1109/tmag.1974.1058514,"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, Vol. MAG-10, No. 4, December 1974 (New York, US) K.

   The present invention involves hierarchical storage controllers which enable a scalable storage system. The scalable storage system is capable of causing a very large amount of discrete disk units to appear as a single drive. The scalable storage system is organized into a hierarchical structure by providing a series of disk arrays in parallel with a controller via Fibre Channel connections to form a virtual disk. The next level in the hierarchical structure is created by connecting a number of virtual disks and a higher level controller in parallel via higher bandwidth connections. This next assemblage of devices is configured to appear as a single drive. Also, the scalable storage system disposes increasingly sized RAM caches to increase system performance. Moreover, wave division multiplexing (WDM) may be utilized to communicate with a file server via a highest level controller.

   A probe assembly and method for ablating tissue is provided. The probe assembly comprises an elongated shaft having a rigid section and a flexible section distally extending from the rigid section. The probe assembly further comprises a tissue penetrating element associated with the flexible section. For example, it can be mounted to the flexible section or can be located on a separate element, such as a trocar that can be disposed within the elongated shaft. The probe assembly further comprises one or more ablative elements, such as electrodes, that is associated with the flexible section. Like the tissue penetrating element, the ablative element(s) can be mounted to the flexible section or can be located on a separate element. Thus, the flexible section of the shaft can be flexed to deflect the tissue penetrating element, so that it can be steered through tissue. In this manner, sensitive anatomical structures can be avoided, e.g., if the sensitive structure lies between the tissue region to be treated and the entry point of the probe assembly. An optional steering assembly can be used to provide active steering to the probe assembly.

    An efficient, time saving, cost-effective method of using a servo track writer (STW) for continuously recording servo information along one, continuous, single helix spiral path on the surface of a magnetic disk in a disk drive. The write transducer is guided along the single-helix spiral path by moving the write transducer at a constant radial velocity while the disk is rotating. The STW moves the write transducer less than a head's width per revolution such that the strokes of each spiral revolution overlaps the stroke of a prior spiral revolution. The resulting servo track centerlines are formed as spiral servo segments that are written quickly and relatively smoothly, but are separate or disjointed from one another. A disk drive incorporating such uniquely written servo information uses suitable offset information as a function of servo wedge number so that the drive may track follow any one of a plurality of circular data tracks or one long spiral data track.

    The present invention involves hierarchical storage controllers which enable a scalable storage system. The scalable storage system is capable of causing a very large amount of discrete disk units to appear as a single drive. The scalable storage system is organized into a hierarchical structure by providing a series of disk arrays in parallel with a controller via Fiber Channel connections to form a virtual disk. The next level in the hierarchical structure is created by connecting a number of virtual disks and a higher level controller in parallel via higher bandwidth connections. This next assemblage of devices is configured to appear as a single drive. Also, the scalable storage system disposes increasingly sized RAM caches to increase system performance. Moreover, wave division multiplexing (WDM) may be utilized to communicate with a file server via a highest level controller.

Preferably, a feedback mechanism generates a positional feedback signal of a position of the chambers of the positionable member relative to the aperture.",MENTOR CORP,ELLIOTT M;;HOEDEMAN M;;BERKEY J;;ELLIOTT D,"MILLS BIOPHARMACEUTICALS, LLC, OKLAHOMA CITY, , US (2007-10-18);;COLOPLAST A/S, HUMLEBAEK, DK (2007-06-28)",https://lens.org/019-632-437-657-044,Granted Patent,no,0,0,15,42,0,A61M37/0069;;A61N5/1007;;A61N5/1027;;A61N2005/1009;;A61N2005/101;;A61N2005/1011;;A61M37/0069;;A61N2005/101;;A61N5/1007;;A61N2005/1009;;A61N5/1027;;A61N2005/1011,A61N5/10;;A61M36/12;;A61M37/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

DORR CO. Aug. 9, 1950, No. 19824/50. Class 46 In the method of continuously regenerating exhausted granular ion exchange material in which the .material passes continuously downwardly first through a regeneration zone Z3, Fig. 1, and then through a rinsing zone Z2 while a subsided and submerged body of the material is continually 'present in each zone although in transit, and in which rinse water 29 passes continuously upwardly. through the rinsing zone Z2 in countercurrent to the exchange material and thus becomes enriched with regenerant chemical, a mixing zone M is maintained functionally interposed between the rinsing and regeneration zones and substantially free from exchange material in transit, fresh regenerant chemical is continuously added at 33 to spent rinse water in the mixing zone M to produce fresh regenerant solution, and this regenerant solution 30 is passed upwardly through the regeneration zone Z3 and discharged as spent regenerant solution at 34. Externally of a tower 10 in which the zones Z2, Z3 and M are established the exchange material may passcontinuously downwardly through an exhaustion zone Z1 in a tank 11 to which liquid to be treated (e.g. hard water) is admitted at 19 and from which treated liquid (e.g. soft water) is withdrawn at 20. Exhausted ion-exchange material is withdrawn through a conduit 14 from just above a perforate supporting plate 17 and regenerated and rinsed material fed back to the tank 11 along a conduit 12. The mixing zone M is maintained substantially free from exchange material by the interposition in the tower 10 of a partition 23 having small perforations 25 through which regenerant liquid passes upwards and a spout 24 through which exchange material passes downwards. In the apparatus of Fig. 2 the transport of the exchange material is effected and controlled by water supplied under pressure from a header H. Regenerated and rinsed exchange material slides down conical baffles 47, 47a, Fig. 4, and the conical bottom of a tower 35 through a valve V1 into the horizontal section 37b of a transfer conduit 37 and is impelled along it and to an exhausting (e.g. softening) tank 36 by water from the header H forced along a conduit 56 through a control valve 56a. The rate of flow of the slurry thus formed is observed on an indicator 60a connected to a Venturi flow-meter 60. The valves VI and 56a are preferably maintained at a fixed setting, while the rate of transit of exchange material through the whole apparatus is controlled by water passing from the header H through a pipe 58 via a valve 58a and flow-meter 58b. This water passes into the transfer conduit 37 at 59, some exerting a back-pressure along the section 37b and the remainder passing up the vertical section 37c of the conduit 37 as further diluent for the slurry. The end of the conduit 37 which feeds into the tank 36 is provided with a restrieted orifice 61 to ensure that the maximum rate of flow of slurry into the tank 36 corresponds to the maximum rate of passage of exchange material through the tower 35. This maximum slurry rate is .reached when no water is permitted to pass along the pipe 58, valve VI is fully open and valve 56a is set to provide the required quantity of carrier water. Exhausted exchange material is conveyed from the tank 36 up a conduit 38 by an ejector 67 to which water is supplied at a controlled and measured rate frcm the header H, the resultant slurry being discharged into a reservoir 39 at the top of the regeneration tower at a rate slightly greater than that at which it gravitates through a neck 42 in the bottom 41 of the reservoir. Excess slurry flows back into the tank 36 through a pipe 40. As in Fig. 1 the liquid flow in the tower 35 is substantially upward and is initiated by rinse water supplied from the header H along a pipe 49 to a series of concentric circular pipes 49a, Fig. 4, perforated along their upper surfaces. The plate 44 separating the rinsing zone below it from the regenerating zone above it (corresponding to the plate 23 of Fig. 1) is provided with a number of spouts 45 for the downward. discharge of material each having a length such that the 'pumping' effect due to them on the liquid,above the partition is counterbalanced by the loss in head encountered by the liauid passing upwardly through the holes in the partition, to minimize the downward transfer of solution. Fresh concentrated regenerant solution is introduced from a tank 48c through a pipe 48 and a pipe grid (not shown on Fig. 2) which occupies the mixing zone M which is free from solids and formed between the spouts 45. The pipe grid is perforated along its upper surface. Spent regenerant solution passes to waste via a pipe 53 leading from a space 52 formed between a bed 43 and the reservoir bottom 41. The mixing zone M<SP>1</SP> may alternatively consist of a pipe 73, Fig. 6,. (not shown), outside the tower 35, to which water is pumped from the region surrounding the spouts 45, and into which concentrated regenerant solution. is introduced into the regenerating zone by means of a pipe ring just above the plate 44. The pipe 48 is of course in that case dispensed with.

The lot identification codes (200) are therefore readily recognizable by search engines (610) and otherwise reduce the number of steps required for consumers and others along the supply chain to obtain lot-specific information about packaged goods. Additionally, whenever an individual submits a lot identification code, it provides an opportunity to collect information about the product at that point along the supply chain.

   An open end power wrench includes an operating scheme that identifies when the item within the drive socket is an item that should be rotated by the drive socket. The method for controlling the tube nut wrench includes the steps of operating the motor to generate an output torque. The method then measures an angle of rotation through which the drive socket rotates. The angle of rotation is then compared with an angle defined by the clearance opening. The output torque is limited to a minimal torque level when the angle of rotation of the drive socket is less than the angle defined by the clearance opening. The method then increases the output torque to an operating torque level when the angle of rotation of the drive socket exceeds the angle defined by the clearance opening.

The process includes specifically designing the spacecraft structural elements (20, 30) to have a stiffness that is intrinsically not suitable to meet mission pointing performance requirements in order to reduce weight and volume. To overcome this deficiency, the structural elements (20, 30) are equipped with strain energy control elements (44) that sense strain in the structural elements (20, 30) from on-board and external disturbances, and provide actuation of the structural elements (20, 30) to counteract the sensed strain. The strain energy control elements (44) can be any suitable control element that senses strain and actuates the structural element (20, 30), such as piezoelectric electric or electrostrictive control elements. By reducing the stiffness requirements of the structural elements (20, 30), the control elements (44) can more readily provide a desired actuation for damping purposes in order to meet pointing performance requirements, and thus the weight and volume of the structural elements (20, 30) can be reduced over those known in the art. Relaxing the stiffness requirements of the structural elements (20, 30) allows the structural element (20, 30) to be made of materials having higher strength properties, instead of higher stiffness properties, thus allowing the structural element (20, 30) to meet the strength requirements to survive launch and deployment loads.",TRW INC,TRILLER MICHAEL J;;ELLIOTT LEE E,NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION (2003-12-03),https://lens.org/199-909-697-103-394,Patent Application,yes,1,3,4,4,0,F16F15/005;;Y10T29/53039;;Y10T29/42;;Y10T29/49771;;Y10T29/49622;;Y10T29/53039;;Y10T29/42;;Y10T29/49771;;Y10T29/49622;;F16F15/005,B64G1/38;;B64G1/22;;F16F15/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

A range and range-rate sensor generates signals which are indicative of the distance between the vehicles, as well as the closing or opening velocity of the vehicles. These signals are used to accelerate or decelerate the trailing vehicle to maintain a safe and optimum distance between the vehicles in accordance with the speed of the lead vehicle. The system is noncooperative, so that the lead vehicle need not be similarly equipped in order for the system to operate. The system is capable of overriding the speed control system within the vehicle but can be overridden by the driver when a deceleration or acceleration decision is executed. Although the system can override the speed control system, the speed set into the speed control system can not be exceeded except by driver override. However, overriding of the speed control system by the invention system or by driver override does not destroy the speed set by the driver.",BENDIX CORP,WEIDMAN J;;YEE H;;ELLIOTT J;;MARGOSIAN Z,SIEMENS-BENDIX AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS L.P.

   The present invention is a process for producing an injection-molded thermoplastic work piece having a thermoset coating bonded thereto, comprising the steps of introducing into a closed mold a thermoplastic material, such as a polyolefin, heated to a temperature above its melting point and molding said material to form a work piece; followed by introducing a thermoset coating composition capable of generating free radicals into the closed mold to contact at least a portion of a surface of the work piece, the temperature of which is at or above the temperature at which free radicals contained in the coating composition are generated. The mold is then opened and the work piece is removed after the coating composition has at least partially cured. The present invention is also directed to a molded article made by the described process.

The process includes specifically designing the spacecraft structural elements (20, 30) to have a stiffness that is intrinsically not suitable to meet mission pointing performance requirements in order to reduce weight and volume. To overcome this deficiency, the structural elements (20, 30) are equipped with strain energy control elements (44) that sense strain in the structural elements (20, 30) from on-board and external disturbances, and provide actuation of the structural elements (20, 30) to counteract the sensed strain. The strain energy control elements (44) can be any suitable control element that senses strain and actuates the structural element (20, 30), such as piezoelectric electric or electrostrictive control elements. By reducing the stiffness requirements of the structural elements (20, 30), the control elements (44) can more readily provide a desired actuation for damping purposes in order to meet pointing performance requirements, and thus the weight and volume of the structural elements (20, 30) can be reduced over those known in the art. Relaxing the stiffness requirements of the structural elements (20, 30) allows the structural element (20, 30) to be made of materials having higher strength properties, instead of higher stiffness properties, thus allowing the structural element (20, 30) to meet the strength requirements to survive launch and deployment loads.",TRW INC,TRILLER MICHAEL J;;ELLIOTT LEE E,NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION (2003-12-03),https://lens.org/137-980-737-919-13X,Search Report,yes,4,0,4,4,0,F16F15/005;;Y10T29/53039;;Y10T29/42;;Y10T29/49771;;Y10T29/49622;;Y10T29/53039;;Y10T29/42;;Y10T29/49771;;Y10T29/49622;;F16F15/005,B64G1/38;;B64G1/22;;F16F15/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The digital video recorder (200) includes a disk (220) and a video data stream manager (230) that in response to the real-time video signal (106) provides a first video stream (222) to store a selected video segment on the disk (220). The video data stream manager (230), in response to commands from a microprocessor (140) in the set-top box (100), receives a second video stream (223) based on the selected video segment stored on the disk (220) to generate the recorded video signal (108). The set-top box (100) includes a multiplexer (140) that selects the real-time video signal (106) during a real-time interval and selects the recorded video signal (108) during the playback interval to generate an output video data stream to a display device (300).",KEEN PERSONAL MEDIA INC;;KEEN PERSONAL TECHNOLOGIES INC,ELLIOTT TIMOTHY J;;BOYLE WILLIAM B,,https://lens.org/076-861-874-407-146,Patent Application,yes,6,3,3,7,0,H04N21/43622;;H04N21/43622;;H04N5/76;;H04N5/76;;H04N5/775;;H04N5/775;;H04N5/781;;H04N5/781;;H04N21/4135;;H04N21/4135,H04N5/76;;H04N5/775;;H04N5/781;;H04N21/41;;H04N21/436,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The instruction includes a final predetermined key or keyboard element manipulation, which completes instructions to signal the initiation of new instructions. The instructions and operational signals can be recorded together on a two-track record, such as magnetic tape, so that the instructions are coordinated with the system actuating signals. The system is manually started and introductory material is presented from the record. After instructions are given, a signal starts a clock to measure the elapsed time for performance of instructions. The clock is terminated by a system actuating signal following execution of the last instruction. In the preferred system, actuation of the predetermined key will initiate the record drive which will be stopped after each unit of instruction is given by an appropriate signal on the other track, different from the ones actuating the clock. Thus, student controlled responses combined with accurate timing of the activities completed is achieved.",RUEGG ROBERT J;;SMITH ELLIOTT P,RUEGG ROBERT J;;SMITH ELLIOTT P,RUEGG ROBERT J.

The operating valve includes a throttling range which extends between optimum injection gas pressure levels based on the amount of injection gas pressure available at the well head to thereby increase the overall efficiency of the system. The variable orifice valve includes a pressure charged bellows and a coil spring in series to produce a linear resultant load rate which in turn cooperates with contoured closure surfaces in the valve to produce a linear relationship between orifice size and injection gas pressure. Gas is thus injected into the production column or tubing at a rate which is linearly related primarily to the casing pressure with the throttling range of the operating valve producing a broad response in the gas injection rate.

   Molded articles or substrates having an in-mold coating thereon are disclosed. The in-mold coated substrates are produced by a method wherein the flow of the in-mold composition onto the substrate can be selectively controlled. The molded articles can be preferentially coated in desired or predetermined areas with in-mold coating compositions by controlling the thickness or depth of various sections of the substrate. 

   In a further embodiment, a molded article or substrate is provided with an in-mold coating containment flange to substantially contain the in-mold coating within the mold cavity and on the desired area of a part before the coating has been cured. 

   In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a molded article or substrate is provided with at least runner section or preferred flow channel to promote in-mold coating flow over the surface of a substrate. 

   A further embodiment of the present invention provides a molded article with an area of increased relative thickness at the location of in-mold coating injection to encourage or promote in-mold coating flow.

Each pocket has two end faces that are spaced axially of the retainer ring and two side faces that are spaced laterally of the axial spacing between the two end faces. The pocket extends radially through inner and outer peripheral edges of the retainer ring to receive a roller therein having a diameter which is greater than the radial span of the pocket end faces so that the roller extends beyond the inner and outer peripheral edges of the retainer ring. The axial spacing between the pocket end faces is slightly greater than the axial length of the roller to provide restricted clearances between the ends of the roller and the end faces of the pocket when the roller is centered within the pocket. Chamfers are provided on the end faces of the pockets at the inner and outer peripheral edges thereof. These chamfers enable the roller to pivot within the pocket from a position wherein the roller is aligned axially between the pocket end faces to a cocked position wherein both end faces of the pocket contact the roller and/or the side faces of the pocket contact the roller to resist further pivotal movement. -1a-,FMC CORP,DERNER WILLIAM J;;ELLIOTT JAMES R,,https://lens.org/128-506-645-076-580,Granted Patent,no,0,0,16,16,0,F16C19/26;;F16C33/4623;;F16C43/04;;F16C33/4623;;F16C19/26;;F16C43/04,F16C19/26;;F16C33/46;;F16C43/04,308-39,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The microphone outputs are fed via amplifiers (12, 13, 14, 15) to a digital signal processor (11) having an adaptation algorithm in a memory store. The processor generates an error signal which is used to adjust the synchrophase angle between the reference propeller (10) and a synchrophased propeller (9), controlled by a synchrophaser (8). Thus the synchrophase angle is varied dynamically during flight to minimise propeller noise in the cabin over a range of flying conditions.",SECRETARY TRADE IND BRIT,ELLIOTT STEPHEN J;;NELSON PHILIP A,,https://lens.org/191-039-911-165-055,Granted Patent,no,0,0,12,12,0,B64C1/40;;B64C11/50;;G10K2210/123;;G10K2210/1281;;G10K2210/3046;;G10K11/17857;;G10K11/17854;;G10K11/17883;;B64C1/40;;B64C11/50;;G10K2210/123;;G10K2210/3046;;G10K2210/1281;;G10K11/17854;;G10K11/17857;;G10K11/17883,B64C1/40;;B64C11/50;;F01N1/00;;G10K11/178;;H04R3/00,D23410106    M,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A predictive modeling algorithm for deriving the outcome of UV photochemical reactions. The model is created in three sections: A parameter input section, a calculation section, and an output section. Input parameters are loaded into the model, calculations are made automatically by the algorithm, and output numbers given which constitute a theoretical test result. The model is adaptable in that it provides for various wavelengths and levels of input energy, a wide variety of reactive chemical components, and many different surface types. An extensive range of photochemical experiments can be modeled with a simple PC-type computer and commercially available software. This predictive model is designed to simulate real reactions as done in a lab, but many times faster and cheaper.

A dispenser according to the invention is able to prevent access to a second or reserve roll of tissue until a first or dispensing roll is entirely or substantially depleted. As a result, the tissue of the first roll must be used up, or substantially used up, before tissue from the second roll can be used, thereby avoiding tissue waste. The dispenser of the invention can be used with reduced core tissue rolls, where each roll has first and second core sections that are spaced apart from each other to form a gap between facing ends thereof so that the total length of the core sections is less than the width of the tissue wound onto the core sections. The dispenser of the invention thus encourages the use of reduced core tissue rolls, which results in a reduction of waste resulting from used tissue cores.",BAY WEST PAPER CORP,ELLIOTT ADAM T;;KNIGHT DANIEL J,BAY WEST PAPER CORPORATION (2004-06-15);;ESSITY OPERATIONS WAUSAU LLC (2006-12-15),https://lens.org/079-058-805-789-570,Patent Application,yes,29,24,13,13,0,A47K10/38;;A47K10/38;;A47K10/3836;;A47K10/3836;;A47K2010/3253;;A47K2010/3253,A47K10/32;;A47K10/38,242/596.8,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In accordance with one preferred flat cable embodiment (10), adapted for telephone under carpet applications, two precisely offset arrays of rectangularly shaped conductors (13, 14) are separated by a center film (16), with each array being adhesively bonded through an associated adhesive coating (21 or 22) to only the respectively adjacent one of two outer films (18 or 19). The laminating apparatus (30) includes a first pair of laminating rollers (31, 32), one (31) being both internally and externally heated, and having a smooth peripheral surface formed of a layer (68) of resilient material, the other (32) having a steel peripheral surface formed with a plurality of specially dimensioned conductor-receiving grooves (72), and a second pair of finishing rollers (37, 38), each being unheated and having a smooth, peripheral surface formed of a layer (37 a or 38a) of resilient material. It has been found that by utilizing a center film (16) with no adhesive coating initially on either side thereof, and the specially constructed laminating apparatus (30), when used in conjunction with properly chosen laminating pressures, temperatures and feed rate, the resultant fabricated cable (10) exhibits excellent bond strength, and consistently and precisely maintained conductor spacings. In accordance with another aspect of the invention, isolating strips (28, 29) are at least lightly secured on opposite sides of, and extend transversely across, the center film (16) at predetermined spaced terminating points therealong so as to facilitate the termination of the cable (FIGS. 8-12), and the subsequent connectorization of the terminated conductor ends (13a, 14a) thereof to a connector (25).",WESTERN ELECTRIC CO,ELLIOTT WILLIAM A;;TAYLOR THOMAS J,AT & T TECHNOLOGIES INC.

A dispenser according to the invention is able to prevent access to a second or reserve roll of tissue until a first or dispensing roll is entirely or substantially depleted. As a result, the tissue of the first roll must be used up, or substantially used up, before tissue from the second roll can be used, thereby avoiding tissue waste. The dispenser of the invention can be used with reduced core tissue rolls, where each roll has first and second core sections that are spaced apart from each other to form a gap between facing ends thereof so that the total length of the core sections is less than the width of the tissue wound onto the core sections. The dispenser of the invention thus encourages the use of reduced core tissue rolls, which results in a reduction of waste resulting from used tissue cores.",WASAU PAPER TOWEL & TISSUE LLC,ELLIOTT ADAM T;;KNIGHT DANIEL J,ESSITY OPERATIONS WAUSAU LLC (2018-01-01),https://lens.org/162-808-556-209-982,Patent Application,yes,36,21,13,13,0,A47K10/38;;A47K10/38;;A47K10/3836;;A47K10/3836;;A47K2010/3253;;A47K2010/3253,A47K10/38;;A47K10/32;;B65H16/02;;B65H19/10,242/560,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The lamp is connected in series with a semiconductor control circuit across the DC supply. The semiconductor control circuit operates as a resistive ballast whose effective resistance decreases as vapor pressure within the lamp increases during warm-up, thereby limiting lamp current to a safe value immediately after ignition while reducing the amount of power dissipated in the ballast circuit during normal operation for improved efficiency. The conductivity of the resistive ballast circuit is controlled in response to variations in both lamp voltage and lamp current to control the amount of power delivered to the lamp.

As a result, the tissue of the first roll must be used up, or substantially used up, before tissue from the second roll can be used, thereby avoiding tissue waste. The dispenser of the invention can be used with reduced core tissue rolls, where each roll has first and second core sections that are spaced apart from each other to form a gap between facing ends thereof so that the total length of the core sections is less than the width of the tissue wound onto the core sections. The dispenser of the invention thus encourages the use of reduced core tissue rolls, which results in a reduction of waste resulting from used tissue cores.",WAUSAU PAPER TOWEL & TISSUE LLC,ELLIOTT ADAM T;;KNIGHT DANIEL J,ESSITY OPERATIONS WAUSAU LLC (2018-01-01),https://lens.org/034-772-726-413-247,Granted Patent,yes,37,29,13,13,0,A47K10/38;;A47K10/38;;A47K10/3836;;A47K10/3836;;A47K2010/3253;;A47K2010/3253,B65H18/04;;A47K10/32;;A47K10/38,242/597.5;;242/560;;242/597.8,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

An aircraft cabin (1) contains four microphones and two loudspeakers which form the active elements of a noise control system. The microphone outputs are fed via amplifiers to a digital signal processor (11) having an adaptation algorithm in a memory store. The processor generates an error signal which is used to adjust the synchrophase angle between the reference propeller and a synchrophased propeller, controlled by a synchrophaser. Thus the synchrophase angle is varied dynamically during flight to minimize propeller noise in the cabin over a range of flying conditions.",SECRETARY TRADE IND BRIT,ELLIOTT STEPHEN J;;NELSON PHILIP A,SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY THE (1989-01-27),https://lens.org/034-775-808-150-78X,Granted Patent,yes,10,67,12,12,0,B64C1/40;;B64C11/50;;G10K2210/123;;G10K2210/1281;;G10K2210/3046;;G10K11/17857;;G10K11/17854;;G10K11/17883;;B64C1/40;;B64C11/50;;G10K2210/123;;G10K2210/3046;;G10K2210/1281;;G10K11/17854;;G10K11/17857;;G10K11/17883,B64C1/40;;B64C11/50;;F01N1/00;;G10K11/178;;H04R3/00,364/574;;364/424.01;;384/71;;X244  1N,2,0,,,"Journal of Aircraft, vol. 23, No. 2, Propeller Model for Studying Trace Velocity Effects on Interior Noise .;;Automotive Engineering, vol. 89, No. 10, Oct. 1981, Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.

The method is based on digitizing the RF signals and dividing the digitized data into blocks of discrete data points. An initial estimated frequency is calculated for the first block of data and used to generate a synthetic signal. The synthetic signal and individual block of data under analysis are summed and tested by a discrimination function through an iteration process to arrive at an estimated frequency for each block of data points. The results are averaged to arrive at the final calculated frequency for the RF signal.

    A process for designing spacecraft structural elements (  20, 30  ) that increases spacecraft structure intrinsic damping to relax stiffness design constraints that are necessary for precision pointing requirements. The process includes specifically designing the spacecraft structural elements (  20, 30  ) to have a stiffness that is intrinsically not suitable to meet mission pointing performance requirements in order to reduce weight and volume. To overcome this deficiency, the structural elements (  20, 30  ) are equipped with strain energy control elements (  44  ) that sense strain in the structural elements (  20, 30  ) from on-board and external disturbances, and provide actuation of the structural elements (  20, 30  ) to counteract the sensed strain. The strain energy control elements (  44  ) can be any suitable control element that senses strain and actuates the structural element (  20, 30  ), such as piezoelectric electric or electrostrictive control elements. By reducing the stiffness requirements of the structural elements (  20, 30  ), the control elements (  44  ) can more readily provide a desired actuation for damping purposes in order to meet pointing performance requirements, and thus the weight and volume of the structural elements (  20, 30  ) can be reduced over those known in the art. Relaxing the stiffness requirements of the structural elements (  20, 30  ) allows the structural element (  20, 30  ) to be made of materials having higher strength properties, instead of higher stiffness properties, thus allowing the structural element (  20, 30  ) to meet the strength requirements to survive launch and deployment loads.

In order to eliminate or minimize servo position signal errors caused by a wide-reading transducer head encountering signals from both of a pair of angularly aligned servo burst fields, the servo burst fields are recorded in opposing phase.",WESTERN DIGITAL CORP,ELLIOTT TIMOTHY J;;REISER STEVEN M,WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION (1998-01-07),https://lens.org/054-592-919-467-564,Granted Patent,yes,4,121,1,1,0,G11B5/59688;;G11B5/59688,G11B5/596,360/77.08;;360/77.02,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
