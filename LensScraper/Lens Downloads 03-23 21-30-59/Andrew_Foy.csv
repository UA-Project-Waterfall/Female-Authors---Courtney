    The present invention provides assays to identify compounds that affect microglial cell activation, and specifically assays to identify compounds that affect secretion of cytokines from these microglial cells by modulating PGE _{ 2 } -mediated activity. The assays of the invention include assays for testing microglial cell activation by contacting microglia with compounds that modulate -amyloid PGE _{ 2 } -mediated activation, which can be identified by cellular activity such as secretion of cytokines, e.g., TNF- and IL-1. The effect of the candidate compound can be determined by comparing the effect with a control culture which is not contacted with the compound, or by comparing the effect with a standardized profile.

   Methods and apparatus are described for synthesizing and distributing personal care products in a retail environment. Preference data are generated in the retail environment. The preference data are representative of expressed preferences of a consumer with regard to personal care. In response to the preference data, instructions for reproducibly synthesizing at least one personal care product are generated in a format perceivable and understandable by humans. The at least one personal care product is synthesized in the retail environment in accordance with the instructions. The at least one personal care product is provided to the consumer before the consumer leaves the retail environment.
