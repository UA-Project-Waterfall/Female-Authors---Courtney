    A rotary, tubular hole cutter for quickly cutting holes through materials such as wood, fiberboard, and drywall. The device includes a tubular member with a backing plate attached to one end, with holes in the backing plate that enable the attachment of a conventional heavy-duty hole saw arbor. The device includes three equally spaced gullets, each of which has a cutting bit mounted adjacent to the trailing edge of the gullet, with the cutting face lying in the direction of rotation. The combination of three gullets and cutting bits, along with the cutting bit geometry, enable fast extraction of the puck or core from the tubular member after the cut is completed, by hand or other suitable device. The nature and aggressiveness of the cutting action is limited by the geometry of the cutting bits and their relationship to the top surface of the tubular member.

To this end, a sensor with laser-beam receiving zone is allocated in the underframe. The laser-beam receiving zone or the entire sensor can be vertically adjusted via a hydraulic cylinder so that the laser-beam receiving zone can be put into the laser beam without changing the position of the wagon drill itself. The sensor is connected to a microprocessor in which the requisite blasting pattern is stored and via which the drilling carriage is correspondingly controlled. Furthermore, the information determined for monitoring at all pivot points and longitudinally displaceable points collects in the microprocessor so that a continuous plausibility check is possible. A substantial reduction in the drilling time, in particular the re-setting time, and operations running in parallel can be achieved with a wagon drill of this type. <IMAGE>",E & PK INGBUERO,ECKER ROBERT;;HENNECKE HERMANN-PETER,,https://lens.org/102-941-453-010-897,Patent Application,no,0,24,1,1,0,E21B7/022;;E21B7/025;;E21D9/006;;G01C7/06,E21B7/02;;E21B15/04;;E21B44/00;;E21D9/00;;G01C7/06,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The unique slide bolt, or the nearby lock casing, is angularly offset to create a fulcrum. The bolt also has an underlying tab that is designed to rest in either of two side-by-side locator notches atop a cuff's pawl. One notch firmly locates the bolt in a double-locking position, while the other notch normally keeps it in a non-locking position. To shift the bolt into its double-locking position, an authorized user presses any suitable actuator (e.g., the tiny end of a handcuff key or a ball-point pen end) against an exposed inclined end of the bolt. This pivots the bolt about the fulcrum and against the casing, so that it lifts the tab out of the non-locking locator notch. Continued pressure by the actuator forces the bolt to slide over a ledge that separates the notches. Once the tab rides past the ledge, it re-pivots into the double-locking position.

In the preferred embodiments, a standard pawl and multi-piece slide-bolt assembly have been modified to prevent premature sliding of the bolt into its ""double-locking"" position, and to prevent dislodging of the bolt back into its ""non-locking"" position. The unique slide bolt, or the nearby lock casing, is angularly offset to create a fulcrum. The bolt also has an underlying tab that is designed to rest in either of two side-by-side locator notches atop a cuffs pawl. One notch firmly locates the bolt in a double-locking position, while the otha notch normally keeps it in a nonlocking position. To shift the bolt into its double-locking position, an authorized user presses any suitable actuator (e.g., the tiny end of a handcuff key or a ball-point pen end) against an exposed inclined end of the bolt. This pivots the bolt about the fulcrum and against the casing, so that it lifts the tab out of the non-locking locator notch. Continued pressure by the actuator forces the bolt to slide over a ledge that separates the notches. Once the tab rides past the ledge, it repivots into the double-locking position. A spring action holds the tab (and bolt) in place until a user forcefully retracts the bolt when unlocking the cuffs.",ECKER ROBERT J;;KOETSCH PAUL W,ECKER ROBERT J;;KOETSCH PAUL W,,https://lens.org/046-854-261-117-142,Patent Application,no,0,0,2,2,0,E05B75/00;;E05B75/00;;Y10T70/40;;Y10T70/40;;Y10T70/404;;Y10T70/404,E05B75/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The necessary driving force is transmitted to the conveyor belt via the drive units which are distributed in order to achieve this, for which purpose the driving and guiding strip, which also extends longitudinally, is situated on the underside of the belt. This driving and guiding strip takes the form of an elastic web can be easily connected, preferably by means of adhesive, to the conveyor belt in this manner and is therefore able to transmit large forces over long serviceable lives. Effective adhesion can be achieved by means of the matching width of the foot and of the driving and guiding strip, the driving and guiding strip not being continuous in the region of the belt clips, which means that the forces can be imparted uniformly even in the case of a continuous belt. The drive units which engage separately along the length of the conveyor belt exert a lower tractive force on the belt than would be required if the reversing mechanisms were equipped with drives. Furthermore, each of the said drive units which is designed to transmit power to an individual structure can also supply the driving force normally supplied by adjacent motors and/or drives which may have broken down. This means that a high level of operational reliability can be achieved, quite apart from the fact that assembly and ...

No. WO93/19917 PCT Pub. Date Oct. 14, 1993.The recycling of used polyurethane foam is made possible by a process in which the starting material is first dried to a moisture content of 2 to 4% and is then filled into a multi-part mold (16, 17, 18) that defines the molded part (32). The parts of the mold (16, 17, 18) are then, with generation of the necessary compression pressure of below 20 N/mm2, pressed together and locked. These molds (16, 17, 18) that are subject to the compression pressure are heated in a tunnel furnace (20) so that the molding material reaches a temperature of approximately 130 DEG C. After a predefined holding time, the molds (16, 17, 18) can be opened under pressure and the molded parts (32) can be removed. Molded parts (32) with a thickness of 42 mm and of corresponding size have been produced successfully with this process. Instead of the molds (16, 17, 18), it is also possible that a two-part tool is used. Also possible is the use of turntables (14, 41, 44), whereby the pressing and holding time can be shortened by adding an accelerator. The process, which comprises only one pressing step, enables an approximately continuous operation.",HECKER & KROSCH GMBH & CO KG,KROSCH KARL;;KROSCH BARTHEL;;KROSCH MICHAEL;;ECKER ROBERT,,https://lens.org/182-297-275-137-883,Patent Application,no,0,2,14,14,0,B29B13/06;;B29B13/10;;B29B17/0042;;B29C33/36;;B29C35/0277;;B29C43/00;;B29C67/207;;B29K2075/00;;B29K2105/04;;Y10S425/812;;Y10S264/07;;Y10S425/11;;Y10S264/916;;Y10S425/108;;Y10S425/246;;Y10S425/247;;Y02W30/62;;B29C67/207;;B29K2105/04;;B29C35/0277;;B29B13/06;;B29C33/36;;B29B13/10;;B29B17/0042;;B29C43/00;;B29K2075/00;;Y10S264/916;;Y10S425/108;;Y10S264/07;;Y10S425/247;;Y10S425/812;;Y02W30/62;;Y10S425/11;;Y10S425/246,B29B13/06;;B29B13/10;;B29B17/00;;B29C33/36;;B29C35/02;;B29C43/00;;B29C43/04;;B29C67/20,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    An implanted medical device (IMD) conserves power by discriminating received radio frequency (RF) signals between noise and data based on frequency. Data is processed while noise is attenuated. The IMD operates in a first, relatively low, power mode while not receiving the RF signals, in a second, higher, power mode responsive to receiving RF signals, and operates in still higher power mode when the RF signals' average frequency over a selected period is within a predetermined range. A receiver circuit receives RF signals and discriminates a data signal from noise based on average frequency of the RF signals over selected time periods. The receiver circuit operates in a power-conserving mode unless it receives RF signals, or otherwise operates in a relatively higher-power mode. The receiver transfers signals to a telemetry circuit that operates in a power-conserving mode until it receives a valid data signal to operate in higher power mode.
