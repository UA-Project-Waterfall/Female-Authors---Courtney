This heat exchanger can be operated in either a simple cycle mode of operation or a combined cycle mode of operation.

The damper (46) and the bypass stack (48) are preferably disposed between the first and the second heat transfer stages. Hot fluid can be received into the heat exchanger from the combustion turbine (14) and directed through the heat transfer stages (44, 50) where heat is transferred from the hot fluid to the cooling medium flowing through the tubes of the heat transfer stages (44, 50). Preferably, the hot fluid enters the heat exchanger upstream of the first heat transfer stage (44). After flowing through the first heat transfer stage, the hot fluid can be directed by the damper (46) to either the bypass stack (48) or the second heat transfer stage (50). The damper may have at least two positions which include a first position and a second position.

    A system and method are provided for reducing the number of depth clear operations in a hardware graphics pipeline. Initially, a frame count is stored into a frame buffer associated with the hardware graphics pipeline. The stored frame count is associated with a pixel. A depth clear operation is then performed based at least in part on the frame count utilizing the hardware graphics pipeline.

An electronic digital display is responsive to the electrical signal from the pressure transducer to display the balloon pressure measured by the pressure transducer. The system is especially suited for coronary angioplasty in which a catheter is inserted through blood vessels in the human body to the vicinity of a stenosis. The catheter carries an inflatable balloon to the vicinity of the stenosis, where it is inflated, and the fluid pressure monitoring system of the present invention detects and digitally displays to the cardiologist the pressure inside the inflated balloon. The pressure transducer is interchangeable with standard pressure transducers such as those used for monitoring substantially lower pressure such as a person's blood pressure and the digital display is also used to display a person's blood pressure.

Because of this correlation, the difference between the luminance signals of the two lines is usually much smaller than luminance signal of either line alone, and requires less bandwidth. The present invention takes advantage of the natural correlation in a television picture in the horizontal and vertical directions for bandwidth reduction without significant impairment of the reproduced picture. This is accomplished by processing the television signal for bandwidth reduction in particular ways and transmitting it entirely in the analog domain. The bandwidth requirement is reduced for the transmission of the video signals over a transmission channel such as a cable television channel, a broadcast channel or a storage medium.",GEN ELECTRIC,TIEMANN JEROME J;;CUTLER SCOTT E;;WELLES II KENNETH B,WIRELESS EQUIPMENT SALES & SERVICE CORPORATION (1993-03-17);;TELEVISION ANALOG COMPRESSION CORPORATION (1993-04-22);;COMBAND TECHNOLOGIES INC.

   A bulk Soft Permanent Virtual Circuit (SPVC) trace processor is provided. The bulk SPVC trace processor receives notifications of newly established SPVCs and SPVC re-routing instances. The bulk SPVC trace processor submits SPVC connection trace commands to corresponding trace source network nodes, and retrieves trace transit list information therefrom. The aggregate SPVC transport path information derived from trace transit list information is stored and provided to higher network management and service provisioning functions. The bulk SPVC trace processor may also be employed to trace SPVC portions of Hybrid SPVCs. As SPVC connection tracing is necessary subsequent to a failure, load balancing techniques are used to spread SPVC connection tracing over time, network resources, and network partitions to prevent weighting down the network. Network planning and design functions previously built for Permanent Virtual Circuit (PVC) provisioning may be seamlessly upgraded in migrating to (H)SPVC connectivity.
