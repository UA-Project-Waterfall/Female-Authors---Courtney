   Embodiments of a wheel locking chock apparatus are disclosed for use with recreational vehicles, travel trailers, and boat trailers having single or tandem axles. The chock apparatus functions not only to hold a trailer in position, but to also limit the rocking or rotational movement of tire and wheel combination where a recreational vehicle or travel trailer is used for camping. The chock apparatus generally comprises a pair of metal chocks, which are movably linked together by a screw driven mechanism for tightening and loosening the chocks about the tread area of a single tire or those tires that are adjacent to one another. The wheel locking chock apparatus uses a drive mechanism having a centrally located rotatable, cylindrical adjusting member that is manually assisted for extending and contracting the chock assemblies.

The locking assemblies are attached to the framework of the openings for an existing cabinet's doors and/or drawers. Each locking assembly has a matching armature plate attached to the corresponding door or drawer for each particular opening. When turned on, the locking assemblies generate an electromagnetic field that attract their matching armature plates and secure them against the locking assemblies thereby securing and locking the door or drawer against the cabinet framework restricting access into the cabinet. The door or drawer is held locked against the cabinet framework until the power supply is turned off by the actuator, at which point the electromagnetic field between the locking assemblies and the armature plates is de-energized, thereby unlocking the cabinet doors or drawers and allowing access into the cabinet.

Uma sapata ou esqui alongado na direção dianteira e traseira é pivotavelmente conectado em um local central à extremidade inferior do braço para a oscilação em torno de um eixo paralelo ao eixo de braço. A sapata de pivotamento alongada tende a vencer picos e vales nas irregularidades da superfície do solo, provendo um efeito de rateio mecânico para reduzir a amplitude de pivotamento do braço quando a unidade passa sobre as irregularidades. Um atuador, conectado ao braço e responsivo a controles de pivotamento do braço, controla o sistema de elevação para manter a altura da unidade acima do solo dentro de uma amplitude previamente selecionada. A amplitude de pivotamento da sapata em relação à horizontal varia com o movimento da unidade de fileira entre a posição de transporte e a posição de trabalho no campo, para prevenir a escavação da sapata quando a unidade é abaixada, sem afetar adversamente a amplitude de pivotamento desejada na operação de operação da unidade.",DEERE & CO,FOX JEFFREY ROBERT,,https://lens.org/002-413-677-060-469,Patent Application,no,0,0,2,2,0,A01D46/08;;Y10S56/10;;Y10S56/03;;A01D46/08;;Y10S56/10;;Y10S56/03,A01D46/08,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A shoe or ski elongated in the fore-and-aft direction is pivotally connected at a central location to the lower end of the arm for rocking about an axis parallel to the arm axis. The elongated pivoting shoe tends to bridge peaks and valleys in the soil surface irregularities proving a mechanical averaging effect to reduce the range of pivoting of the arm as the unit passes the irregularities. An actuator connected to the arm and responsive to arm pivoting controls the lift system to maintain the height of the unit above the ground within a preselected range. The range of pivoting of the shoe relative to the horizontal changes with movement of the row unit between the transport position and field-working position to prevent digging in of the shoe as the unit is lowered without adversely affecting the desired pivot range in the operating position of the unit.,DEERE & CO,FOX JEFFERY ROBERT,DEERE & COMPANY (1999-10-27),https://lens.org/007-052-087-037-171,Granted Patent,yes,6,41,2,2,0,A01D46/08;;Y10S56/10;;Y10S56/03;;A01D46/08;;Y10S56/10;;Y10S56/03,A01D46/08,56 102E;;X 56DIG  3;;X 56DIG  10,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Change-speed gear; torquelimited hydrodynamic brakes; cooling. GENERAL MOTORS CORP. 21 May, 1970 [25 Aug., 1969], No. 24588/70. Headings F2D and F2E. Relates to a sequential arrangement of shift valves in a multi-ratio transmission for a wheeled or tracked vehicle having four fluidpressure-operated brakes and two clutches for establishing by manual selection only an emergency LOW and one Reverse, and by automatic selection four higher forward ratios. In automatic setting, 1-2, 2-3; and 3-4 shift valves 378, 406, 424 receive pressure sequentially, whilst LOW and Reverse are obtained only manually through a LO-1 shift valve 298, which also receives pressure through the downshifted 1-2 valve 378. Reverse requires also a clutch 63 used for direct drive and this, in reverse setting; receives its pressure through the downshifted 3-4 valve 424. Thus neither LOW nor Reverse can be established unless all the automatic shift valves are in their downshifted position. The arrangement includes one forward clutch 51 which is engaged through a manual ranging valve 191 and line 203 for all forward ratios and comprises a first automatic shift valve, 1-2 relay valve 378, having first and second supply ports 117, 393, and first and second outlet ports 307, 398, and arranged, in a downshifted rest position (shown), to connect the first supply port 117 to the first outlet port 307 and thence to feed one brake 89 for first automatic and reverse; and in an automatic range setting of the manual valve 191 is upshifted (right) by a signal 322 indicative of output speed, whereupon the second supply port 393 is connected to the second outlet port 398 and thence to feed a sequential arrangement of succeeding 2-3 and 3-4 shift valves 406, 424 for successive automatic upshifts. The manual valve 191 selects low and reverse in two other positions with the 1-2 relay valve 378 only in its downshifted rest position as follows. In manual LOW the valve 191 supplies pressure through a line 197, 292 to shift left a further valve, L0-1 shift valve 298, to supply pressure from the said first outlet port 307 to a low brake 103 through a line 294 to establish manual low; whilst in R setting the manual valve exhausts the line 197 to return the L0-1 shift valve 298 to its previous rightward setting (shown), again pressurizing the line 309 of the first ratio brake 89, the manual valve 191 also pressurizing a line 195 engaging, through the downshifted 3-4 relay valve 424, the second clutch 63, used also for direct-drive, to establish reverse. Thus both LOW and Reverse can only be established in the downshifted rest position of the 1-2 relay valve 378, since the first outlet port 307 is exhausted when the relay valve 378 is upshifted by the speed signal 322. Function summary.-Four reduced ratios, direct-drive and one reverse are provided. The first ratio is obtained only by setting a manual ranging valve 191 to LOW, and this ratio is rendered effective only below a predetermined output speed, above which the next higher ratio will be established. The remaining four ratios, numbered 1 to 4, are effective in automatic ranges, all four being effective in DR4 setting of the manual valve 191, whilst in settings DR3, DR2 and DR1, a fixed regulated hold pressure 204 cuts out fourth, fourth and third, and fourth third and second respectively, but in all the restricted ranges an automatic upshift occurs above predetermined output speeds. Automatic shift in all ranges is produced by fluid actuation of shift relay valves 378 &c., supplied with actuating pressure by shift signal valves 316 &c., operated by fluid pressure responsive to output speed, by a centrifugal governor valve 223, and torque demand, by engine intake-manifold depression loading a modulator valve 241. Detent (kickdown) shifts are possible in each automatic range by accelerator-controlled detent pressure 174, regulated to a fixed value, which is lower than hold pressure controlled by the manual valve 191, so that the latter can make a downshift at a higher speed than can detent. Screw pressure during shift is graduated by individual trimmer valves 461 &c., as well as by' restrictors in shift-valve feed and exhaust lines. The level of steady servo pressure is augmented in reverse, but is otherwise constant. A torque converter lock-up clutch 23 is engaged automatically above a predetermined input speed by an input-driven pitot governor 267, and is released momentarily during shift. An hydrodynamic service brake 30 on the gear input shaft, shares a cooler 160 with the torque converter, and its control valve 541 includes a torque-limiting relief valve. Gear arrangement.-The gear comprises four sun - ring planet trains, interconnected, as shown in Fig. 2, between a torque-converterdriven input shaft 22 and an aligned output shaft 99. Selective clutches 51, 63 connect input 22 respectively to the connected third sun 38 and second ring 44, or to the connected first and second suns 48, 43. Brakes 76, 82, 89, 103 hold respectively the connected first and second suns 48, 43; the first carrier 47; the connected third and fourth rings 39, 101; and the fourth carrier 97. The clutch 51 (forward clutch) is engaged in all forward ratios. Four reduced ratios and direct-drive are obtained by also applying respectively brakes 103, 89, 82, 76 and clutch 63. The clutch 63 (direct clutch) also provides, with brake 89, the one reverse ratio, and that brake 89 is also applied alone in neutral. The driving torque-converter has a lock-up clutch 23. Hydrodynamic brake.-The turbine-driven gear input shaft 22 carries vanes 31, Fig. 2, coacting with fixed vanes 32 in a casing to form an hydrodynamic brake 30, when the casing is filled, as described below, with circulating liquid. Fluid pressure supply, pressure regulator and cooling.-Two pumps are provided, one, 112, supplying the system main 117, the other, 114, supplying a torque-converter feedline 146, with the assistance of spill from a tube pressure regulator 139 which supplies the gear lubricating system 136 at 80 p.s.i. A main pressure regulator 119 regulates system main pressure 117 by spill to the lubrication line 136 under the combined rightward (pressure-increasing) loading of a spring 123, acting through a plug e, and opposing leftward loading by delivery pressure 117 reaching its right end through a central bore 129, and by system pressure acting leftwards on the differential area of the plug e through a line 135 supplied in all forward ratios, but exhausted through the manual valve 191 in reverse setting, so that regulated pressure in reverse is augmented from its normal forward value of 180 p.s.i. to 300 p.s.i. The central valve bore 129 has an additional port leading to the space between equal end lands a, b of the regulator valve. Any leakage past the land b is exhausted at 134, and this provides a positive seal for the end chamber at the land a. A converter by-pass valve 150 regulates converter feed pressure 146 to 62À5 p.s.i., and the converter outlet 156 passes through a cooler 160 and line 154 to a converter pressure regulator 157, set for 25 p.s.i. The same cooler 160 is used by switching (described below) to cool flow from the hydrodynamic brake 30. The various shift valves exhaust the ratio servos which they control through a common exhaust line 306 and exhaust pressure regulator 313, which maintains a predetermined low pressure in the exhaust line 306. Control pressures. Output governor pressure 236, for ratio shift, is provided by an outputdriven governor valve 223, loaded by primary and secondary centrifugal masses 229, 231, not further described. Governor pressure 236 is supplied to the shift signal valves through a one-way ball check valve 238, for rapid pressure increase, but slow decrease through a parallel restrictor 239, to reduce drive line shock due to sudden reduction of governor pressure. Input governor pressure 270, for controlling torque-converter lock-up, is provided by a pitot tube 269 in an annular can 267 rotating with the turbine-driven gear-input shaft 22, and filled with liquid from the lubrication system. Modulator pressure 248, for assisting output governor pressure 236 for ratio shift, is provided by a modulator pressure regulator 241, loaded by engine inlet-manifold depression 256, to produce a modulator pressure 248 which varies inversely with torque demand (i.e. modulator pressure 248 is inverse TV pressure). Detent pressure 174, for detent downshifts, is provided by a through-detent valve 162, which normally exhausts the detent line 174 by line pressure 117 supplied to its left end chamber 171. Just before, or after, the engine throttle pedal 176 reaches full throttle position, it energizes a solenoid valve 179 to exhaust the chamber 171 and permit the detent valve 162 to regulate line pressure 117 into the detent line 174 at 38 p.s.i. Hold pressure 204, regulated to 45 p.s.i., is provided by a hold regulator valve 209, and is supplied by the manual selector valve 191 to the appropriate shift valves to prevent upshift beyond a particular ratio in a selected setting of the manual valve. Shift valves.-Each shift valve controls one ratio shift and comprises a relay valve which directs main pressure to the appropriate servo, and a signal valve which, in response to governor and modulator pressure, supplies a signal pressure to operate the relay valve. The valves for all shifts 1 to 4 act similarly and a specimen 1-2 shift is as follows. In its spring-biased left position shown, for downshift, the 1-2 relay valve 378 exhausts the second ratio brake line 419 through the downshifted 2-3 relay valve 406, line 398 and common exhaust line 306; and pressurizes the first ratio brake line 309 from the main 117 through a line 307 and the L0-1 shift valve 298. On receipt of 1-2 signal pressure in a line 322 from the 1-2 shift signal valve 316, the 1-2 relay valve 378 upshifts to the right, exha",GEN MOTORS CORP,SCHAEFER ROBERT HERMAN;;FOX JOSEPH ROBERT,,https://lens.org/086-023-640-236-751,Granted Patent,no,0,8,6,7,0,F16H61/0267;;F16H2061/0288,F16H61/02,F2D DA002         DCG;;F2D DA004         DCG;;F2D DA005         DCG;;F2D DA008         DCG;;F2D DA009         DCG;;F2D DA011         DCG;;F2D DA022         DCG;;F2D DA072         DCG;;F2D DA075         DCG;;F2D DA106         DCG;;F2D DA133         DCG;;F2D DCG           DCG;;F2D DC033         DCG;;F2D DC036         DCG;;F2D DC037         DCG;;F2D DC042         DCG;;F2D DC057         DCG;;F2D DC062         DCG;;F2D DC079         DCG;;F2D DC081         DCG;;F2D DC085         DCG;;F2D DC094         DCG;;F2D DC095         DCG;;F2D DC096         DCG;;F2D DC097         DCG;;F2D DC098         DCG;;F2D DC099         DCG;;F2D DC100         DCG;;F2D DC116         DCG;;F2D DC117         DCG;;F2D DC120         DCG;;F2D DC121         DCG;;F2D DC122         DCG;;F2D DC123         DCG;;F2D DC126         DCG;;F2D DC127         DCG;;F2D DE2           DEK;;F2D DE3           DEK;;F2D DE5           DEK;;F2D DE6           DEK;;F2D D10A1         D10;;F2D D10B1         D10;;F2D D10F1         D10;;F2D D10F2         D10;;F2D D10F3         D10;;F2D D10G4         D10;;F2D D10H3B        D10;;F2D D10H4         D10;;F2D D10K          D10;;F2D D2A2          D2DZ;;F2D D2A3          D2DZ;;F2D D2B1          D2DZ;;F2D D2B2          D2DZ;;F2D D2C1A         D2DZ;;F2D D2C3A         D2DZ;;F2D D2C3B         D2DZ;;F2D D2C4B1        D2DZ;;F2D D2C4B2        D2DZ;;F2D D2C5B         D2DZ;;F2D D2D5          D2DZ;;F2D D2D6A         D2DZ;;F2D D2D8          D2DZ;;F2D D218          D218;;F2E EKA           E1Z;;F2E E1B           E1Z;;F2F FA            FA505;;F2F F505          FA505;;U1S S1822;;U1S S1824,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A metering pump includes an actuating mechanism, and a plurality of piston cylinders coupled to the actuating mechanism. A first of the cylinders has a working volume that differs from a second of the cylinders. The actuating member is centrally located and the cylinders are arranged radially about the actuating mechanism. The working volume of the cylinders can be varied by adjusting the spacing of the cylinders from the actuating mechanism, thus varying the stroke of pistons housed within the cylinders, and/or by providing the cylinders with different inner diameters. A method of metering fluids includes independently adjusting stroke of a plurality of pistons to adjust the volume of metered fluid, and selecting different cylinder diameters to adjust the volume of metered fluid.

The cathode assembly includes core 8 and outer sleeve 7 (fig. 1) which carry current to heater filament 9 (fig. 1.). Parts 7 and 8 are joined by sleeves 11 and 12 (fig. 1) of a nickel cobalt ferrous alloy spaced by an insulating sleeve 13 (fig. 1) of a ceramic material. Previously, a mains isolation transformer 14 was used to heat the filament 15. In accordance with the invention, a high frequency power supply of smaller bulk is used. As shown in fig.2, sleeves 11 (and 12) encircle cathode core conductor 8. Currents i (fig.2) are induced in the sleeves 11 and 12 by the magnetic field generated by the high frequency current in core 8, which here is not surrounded by outer sleeve 7. In accordance with the invention, the sleeves 11 and 12 are provided with a surface coating of conductive material 15 (fig.2), e.g. copper or silver. Induced currents are largely confined to the conductive coating due to the skin effect, avoiding losses in and heating of the ferrous alloy itself. The heater supply may operate in the frequency range 1 kHz to 1 MHz; the conductive coating may have a thickness of 1 to 50 micron (micro-metre).",E2V TECH,RICHARDSON ROBERT;;FOX DAVID BERNARD,,https://lens.org/102-799-983-885-362,Patent Application,no,4,3,13,13,0,H01J23/05;;H01J23/14;;H01J23/34;;H01J25/587;;H01J23/05;;H01J23/14;;H01J25/50;;H01J23/34;;H01J23/14;;H01J25/587;;H01J23/05;;H01J25/50,H01J23/14;;H01J23/05;;H01J25/50,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

    A volumetric tissue ablation apparatus includes a probe having a plurality of wires journaled through a catheter with a proximal end connected to the active terminal of a generator and a distal end projecting from a distal end of the catheter. The probe wire distal ends are arranged in an array with the distal ends located generally radially and uniformly spaced-apart from the catheter distal end. A conductor connected to the return terminal of the generator is located relative to the probe wire array to form a closed electrical circuit through tissue to be ablated.

The system and method mitigate errors in measurement readings caused by charge buildup in force balanced instruments that employ charge pulses to generate an electrostatic force to null an inertial proof mass disposed between opposing electrodes. The system and method mitigate charge buildup by applying positive charge pulses alternately to each opposing electrode for a given charge cycle time period followed by negative charge pulses alternately to each opposing electrode for a second given charge cycle time period. The negative charge pulses remove any residual charge on the electrodes caused by the positive charge pulses.

When the unit is operating properly, the floor area is generally clear of cotton and a first distance signal is provided. When a blockage occurs, the area begins to fill with cotton and debris, causing a decrease in the monitored distance. A threshold distance signal which is less than the distance signal to the floor causes an alarm to be activated to warn the operator of a plug. To prevent false alarms where the blockage may only be temporary, a slew rate limitation is built into the processing circuit. In another aspect of the invention, the signal radiated into the cotton conveying path is reflected by cotton, and a doppler circuit detects the presence of a doppler shift in frequency indicating moving cotton in the path. Absence of the doppler shaft indicates either the unit is off or the unit is plugged upstream of the detector. Detection of cotton in the path with a corresponding doppler frequency shift indicates acceptable operation, while detection of cotton with no frequency shift indicates a downstream plug.",DEERE & CO,FOX ROBERT E;;PHELAN JAMES J,DEERE & COMPANY (1990-09-10),https://lens.org/061-837-230-295-842,Granted Patent,yes,9,25,2,2,0,A01D46/085;;Y10S56/15;;A01D46/085;;Y10S56/15,A01D46/08,56/30;;56/10.2;;X 56DIG 15,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Drying may be effected by passing the casings over heated rollers or by inflating the casings and passing them through a tubular drying oven. Rehumidification may be effected by passing the casings through a bath of water or by spraying them with water. In an example, aqueous sodium alginate is extruded through an annular orifice into an aqueous coagulating bath containing calcium chloride and hydrochloric acid. The so-formed tubular casing is then treated in an aqueous calcium chloride bath to effect conversion into calcium alginate, then washed, dried on rollers heated to 70 DEG C. to reduce its water-content to 8 per cent by weight and finally rehumidified in water.

The process significantly reduces the cost of producing additives or alternatives to automotive fuels and lubricants utilizing inexpensive glyceride- or free fatty acid-containing substances, such as animal fats, vegetable oils, rendered fats, and restaurant grease.",BECHTEL BWXT IDAHO LLC,GINOSAR DANIEL M;;FOX ROBERT V,BATTELLE ENERGY ALLIANCE LLC (2005-02-01);;BECHTEL BXWT IDAHO LLC (2000-04-13),https://lens.org/118-429-500-335-351,Granted Patent,yes,19,98,1,3,0,C10L1/19;;C10L1/19;;C10M105/34;;C10M105/34;;C10M129/70;;C10M129/70;;C10M177/00;;C10M177/00;;C10M2207/281;;C10M2207/281;;C10M2207/2815;;C10M2207/2815;;C10N2070/00;;C10N2070/00;;C11C1/04;;C11C1/04;;C11C1/06;;C11C1/06;;C11C3/003;;C11C3/003;;C11C3/02;;C11C3/02;;C11C3/04;;C11C3/04;;Y02E50/10;;Y02E50/10,C10L1/19;;C10M105/34;;C10M129/70;;C10M177/00;;C11C1/04;;C11C1/06;;C11C3/00;;C11C3/02;;C11C3/04,44/388;;508/463;;554/167;;554/170;;554/174,53,45,047-403-833-889-53X;;134-571-202-780-358;;003-421-868-272-17X;;110-649-793-651-983;;123-006-059-052-655;;053-180-019-547-73X;;033-619-601-024-099;;111-616-830-092-03X;;069-155-965-857-140;;032-099-178-172-496;;004-495-923-110-076;;069-990-822-279-469;;058-600-631-623-428;;080-905-034-564-110;;109-450-050-446-766;;050-662-515-694-328;;001-814-886-395-098;;059-610-952-722-967;;053-799-949-582-151;;165-705-502-518-701;;115-749-772-534-569;;007-811-987-852-248;;012-045-725-425-853;;017-997-276-604-345;;008-790-594-362-105;;083-677-489-788-361;;023-186-372-968-403;;042-328-704-326-213;;053-799-949-582-151;;148-318-331-140-153;;064-822-533-525-235;;127-732-970-542-062;;017-226-645-723-804;;155-691-803-803-066;;008-944-190-094-369;;128-417-381-499-090;;012-704-534-802-229;;100-891-199-427-893;;128-851-749-688-669;;003-689-817-040-835;;074-403-350-747-480;;067-612-578-064-958;;009-152-868-345-282;;056-254-159-339-252;;155-691-803-803-066,10.1007/bf02662323;;10.1021/bp00018a006;;18600942;;10.1002/bit.260390304;;10.1007/bf01028485;;10.1007/bf01025275;;10.1007/bf00137815;;10.1007/bf02546210;;10.3109/10242429509003192;;10.3109/10242429408992113;;18615747;;10.1002/bit.260430610;;10.1016/0896-8446(93)90022-p;;10.1016/s0960-894x(96)00614-2;;10.1016/0922-338x(96)89146-x;;10.1252/jcej.29.551;;10.1016/0009-2509(96)00158-3;;10.1016/s0141-0229(97)00212-3;;10.1007/s11746-997-0259-x;;10.1016/s0076-6879(97)86025-9;;10.1016/s0896-8446(97)00043-0;;10.1080/00021369.1988.10868888;;10.1246/cl.1998.921;;10.1002/(sici)1097-0290(19981105)60:3<362::aid-bit13>3.0.co;2-o;;10.1002/(sici)1097-0290(19981105)60:3<362::aid-bit13>3.3.co;2-7;;10099440;;11848995;;10.1021/cr970040u;;10.1002/(sici)1521-4133(19991)101:1<34::aid-lipi34>3.0.co;2-r;;10.1016/s0896-8446(98)00097-7;;10486123;;10.1002/(sici)1097-0290(19991105)65:3<258::aid-bit2>3.0.co;2-a;;10.1002/(sici)1097-0290(19991105)65:3<258::aid-bit2>3.3.co;2-1;;10.1252/jcej.32.338;;10.1002/jccs.199900091;;10.1016/s0896-8446(97)00043-0;;10.1021/ie00021a031;;10.5059/yukigoseikyokaishi.53.358;;10.1021/jo00200a016;;10.1021/i200032a001;;10.1002/aic.690410712;;10.1016/s0001-8686(97)90021-x;;10.1016/s0001-8686(97)00021-3;;9373920;;10.1016/s0021-9673(99)00818-3;;10551352;;10.1002/lipi.19960980206;;10.1016/s0960-8524(99)00025-5;;10.1016/s0141-0229(98)00065-9;;10099449;;10.1002/(sici)1097-0290(19981120)60:4<434::aid-bit5>3.0.co;2-n;;10.1016/s0009-3084(98)00040-1;;10.1021/jo961342j;;10.1252/jcej.29.277;;10.1021/jf950163k;;10.1002/aic.690410712,"JP07062385A Abstract (English), Jul. 3, 1995.*;;JP63112536A Abstract (English), Nov. 05, 1988.*;;(Attachment Sheets 2-5).;;William B.

STURM. 8 Jan., 1969 [8 Jan., 1968], No. 1112/69. Heading A6D. A device for improving the user's golf swing comprises a simulated golf club including hand grip means which can be grasped by a user for swinging the device, and a member which can be releasably secured to the simulated golf club and which can be released therefrom in the course of a simulated golf swing of the device. In addition the device may comprise a target means for receiving the impact of the releasable member for determining the correctness of a simulated golf swing. As shown in Fig. 1 to 5, the device comprises a simulated golf club 24 having a magnetic micrometer assembly 26 constituting the lower end thereof, an aim-ball unit 28, a plastics ball assembly 30, and a target assembly 32. The assembly 26 includes a lower end portion 38 of the shaft 34 as a support, a magnet vernier coupler 40 that surrounds and is locked to the shaft and portion 38 by a spring pin 42 which forms a base, a cylindrical permanent magnet 44 below the end of the shaft 34 and a ferrule 46 having an upper flange engaging a shoulder of the coupler 40 and a lower flange engaging the magnet 44 to maintain a firm assembly. The coupler 40 includes an upper portion 50 provided with external threads 52, an intermediate cylindrical portion 54 of smaller diameter and a lower cylindrical portion 56. An internally threaded heavy cylinder 48 is screwed on the coupler portion 50 and surrounds the ferrule 46, its upward movement being limited by the stop 39. The magnet 44 has a flat top and a chamferred bottom 60 provided with a flat face 62. The weight of the cylinder 48 simulates that of a conventional golf club. The bottom face 72 of the cylinder 48 is provided with a circular series of calibrated markings, such as the numerals 1 to 9 (Fig. 6) and a pointer 76. The aim-ball unit 28 (Fig. 2) comprises a hollow plastics ball 78 simulating a conventional golf ball, and is permanently secured to the top of a support 80. The assembly 30 (Figs. 3 and 7) comprises a hollow lightweight plastics ball 84 simulating a conventional golf ball (except for the openings 94), a cup-shaped outer housing 86 of relatively soft resilient plastics material, an inner housing 88 of semi-rigid plastics material, a disc 90 of ferrous material and means 92 and screw 118 for integrating the elements 84 to 90. The upper face 112 of the disc 90 is bevelled from left to right (as viewed in Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 8, the permanent magnet 44 and the disc 90 are held together in overall engagement by the full magnetic force of the magnet. When the cylinder48 is rotated the disc 90 is separated from the magnet face by a distance depending in the extent to which the magnetic micrometer assembly 26 is rotated and the force required to release the ball assembly 30 from the head 48 of the simulated golf club 24 is thereby adjusted. Uncocking the wrists during the swing of the simulated golf club 24 at a simulated point of club contact with a golf ball dislodges the assembly 30 from the club 24 as the wrists are uncocked and flings it towards the target in an effort to strike a predetermined correct swing zone.",FOX ROBERT B;;STURM ERNST F,FOX ROBERT B;;STURM ERNST F,,https://lens.org/045-051-365-530-534,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,3,0,A63B69/3632;;A63B69/3632;;A63B2024/0068;;A63B2024/0068;;A63B2220/51;;A63B2220/51;;Y10S403/01;;Y10S403/01,A63B15/00;;A63B69/36,A6D DPA           DPA;;A6D D109T4        D109T4;;A6D D13C          D13C,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

[Also in Division B8] In a conveyer, particularly a gravity conveyer, comprising parallel rollers 20 rotatably mounted with respect to parallel side rails 10, 12, each roller comprises a hollow plastics sleeve 30 and two molded plastics end caps which have external generally cylindrical mounting surfaces engaging end openings 36, 38 formed by the sleeve bore and are journalled on support pins rotationally fast in the side rails. As shown, mounting surfaces 42 on end caps 40 comprise axially extending ribs 44, the diameter at the tips of which slightly exceeds that of the sleeve bore so that the end caps may be satisfactorily secured in the sleeve by being forced therein, although adhesive may be used. The mounting surfaces 42 terminate in outwardly extending flanges 46 locating the caps in the sleeve. The sleeve is of thermoplastic material such as polyvinylchloride. The end caps are injection moulded of acetal resin or other thermoplastic material such as P.T.F.E. or nylon. The end caps 40 comprise bearing bores 52 terminating at one end in inwardly directed flanges 56 having apertures 54. One of the pins, 60, preferably of the same material as that of the end caps, comprises a journal portion 62, an hexagonal extension 64 for engagement in an hexagonal aperture 66 in the corresponding side rail 10, and a nose 70 slotted to define resilient fingers 74, 76 which when snapped through the apertures 54 retain, by shoulders 78 thereon, the pin in the end cap. The other pin, 80, is similar to the pin 60 but its journal portion 82 is shorter and a spring 100 is interposed between this portion and the end cap flange 56 to bias the pin outwardly of the cap. To assemble the roller in the side rails, the pin 80 is forced inwardly against the spring 100, the hexagonal extension of the pin 60 is inserted in the aperture 66 of the rail 10, and, when the roller is suitably aligned, the pin 80 is released for its hexagonal extension to engage the corresponding aperture in the rail 12. In Fig. 4 (not shown), the end caps are adhesively secured in the sleeve 30, and the support pins are not axially retained in the end caps but are flanged and bolted to the side rails.",COLONIAL PLASTICS MFG CO,FOX WILLIAM ROBERT;;MCNASH HOWARD HAMILTON,,https://lens.org/091-445-238-424-456,Granted Patent,no,0,4,3,3,0,B65G39/12;;B65G39/12;;B65G39/09;;B65G39/09,B65G39/00;;B65G39/09;;B65G39/12,B8A A4HB          A4HB;;B8A A4K2A         A4HB;;B8A A4K2D         -;;B8A A4K2X         -;;F2U U12           -;;F2U U20A          -;;F2U U21C          -;;F2U U24A          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A manual selector valve for selecting and holding in a first speed drive, selecting a range providing speed and torque demand controlled automatic shifting between four speeds, second to fifth and selecting further lower ranges each preventing normal automatic shifting to the highest speed in the next higher range but permitting shifts to all available higher speeds at higher than normal overrun speeds. For each speed an automatic shift valve controls a relay valve. The relay valves are hydraulically sequentially arranged so each lower speed relay valve when upshifted feeds through the downshifted next higher speed relay valve to feed the motor to engage the next speed ratio drive. The relay valves each have low and high inlet, supply and exhaust ports. In the downshift position the low inlet port is connected to the low supply port and the high supply port is connected to the high exhaust. In the upshift position the high inlet port is connected to the high supply port and the low supply port is connected to low exhaust. The second and higher relay valves have a low inlet port having a restricted feed and a one-way bypass return. Thus each speed drive motor is fed for each speed drive engagement through its restricted feed passage on both up and down shifts and each speed drive motor is exhausted for speed drive disengagement through one restricted exhaust passage on upshifts and another restricted exhaust passage on downshifts to provide individually controlled motor feed and thus engagement rates and individually controlled exhaust rates at one rate during upshift and another rate during downshifts.",GEN MOTORS CORP,SCHAEFER ROBERT H;;FOX JOSEPH R,,https://lens.org/004-145-701-272-424,Granted Patent,no,11,39,1,1,0,F16H61/0267;;F16H61/065;;F16H61/14;;F16H2061/0288;;F16H61/0267;;F16H61/065;;F16H2061/0288;;F16H61/14,F16H61/02;;F16H61/06;;F16H61/14,74/864;;74/645;;74/731;;74/869;;192/3.29;;192109   F,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   Techniques are disclosed for more enabling users to define one or more areas of a graphical user interface (GUI) as being glue-like. When the user moves a pointing device (e.g., a mouse, joystick, track ball, etc.) and as a result, the graphical pointer moves into a painted area, the speed at which the graphical pointer will then traverse the GUI is programmatically slowed. Upon exiting the painted area, the graphical pointer speed is preferably restored to its prior setting. In this manner, the user achieves user-specific, application-independent control over the speed at which the graphical pointer moves.

One of the gauge wheels is a single wheel which moves inwardly toward the centre of gravity in the transport position. The other of the wheels is a walking beam system in the working position and forms a transverse axle in the transport position. Each of the gauge wheels is mounted upon a bracket which can pivot about a horizontal axis from a raised spring biased gauge position to a vertically depending position allowing rotation of the wheel about a vertical axis on the bracket. The header therefore can be transported without the necessity for a separate trailer system.,,FOX THOMAS RUSSELL;;KIDD BRUCE ROBERT,,https://lens.org/198-302-584-415-810,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,3,0,,A01D47/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A personal communication device comprises a housing, a receiver component, a processor and a multi-functional piezoelectric transducer. The transducer is mounted within the housing, is electrically connected to the processor, and produces mechanical vibrations in response to the electrical signals transmitted by the processor. These mechanical vibrations are over a broad range of frequencies and are of a force sufficient to generate a tactile alert, an audible alert, and audible sound over the audible frequency range. 

   The transducer comprises a piezoelectric component and an acoustic member attached to one of the surfaces of the piezoelectric component. The piezoelectric component may comprise either an unimorph or a bimorph structure including a piezoceramic wafer made of lead zirconate titanate and a layer of dampening material sandwiched between the piezoelectric component and the acoustic member. 

   The acoustic member comprises a surrounding wall portion and an end portion which form an acoustic chamber when the member is mounted on a surface of the piezoelectric component. The end portion has an orifice to form a passageway from the chamber through the end portion to the outside of the member.

The magnetic flux arising within the inductor coil member (29) flows to the ends of the pole piece (20) and is formed into a screen (45) placed between the materialsto be joined. The flux induces a current in the screen, and heat is generated to melt the thermoplastics (41, 43) together. Only 30-150 watts of power need be passed through the tank circuit, as a wire which will remain cool under operational wattage may be selected, making air or fluid cooling unnecessary.

The method involves feeding an adhesive coated flexible core to an extruder, which in turn extrudes a low density, closed cell foam sheath about the core. The core and sheath composite is then cut into rod-like elements of predetermined length. Each of the rod-like elements is then restrained at a position spaced inwardly from one its ends, and an orificed plate and an element end are axially pressed together such that the core extends through the orifice in the plate and the foam sheath is compressed. The excess core extending through the plate orifice is then cut, and the pressure between the plate and the element is released, such that the foam sheath returns to its original condition, thereby producing a composite in which the core end is recessed into the foam sheath end. The end of the element is finished by sealing, preferably through the application of a hot brand. The process is repeated on the opposite end of the rod-like element, to thereby produce a core/foam sheath composite article having good bonding between the core and sheath, and in which the core is recessed from the sheath ends. In one form of the invention, the ends of the core are rounded prior to finishing of the article ends.",PLASTIC TECHNOLOGY INC,CAMPBELL JR ROBERT L;;FOX STEVE A,PLASTIC TECHNOLOGY INCORPORATED (1998-02-13),https://lens.org/134-450-460-942-611,Granted Patent,yes,21,35,1,1,0,A45D2/18;;B29C44/5627;;B29C67/0044;;B29C44/5627;;A45D2/18;;B29C67/0044,A45D2/18;;B29C44/56;;B29C67/00,132/246;;132/273,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Transistor switching circuits. ASSOCIATED ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES Ltd. May 14, 1962 [June 6, 1961], No. 20385/61. Heading H3T. A switching arrangement for delivering an output whose polarity depends either upon the polarity or upon the presence or absence of input signals comprises an alternating-current source, such as inverter circuit IC, and two circuits 10, 10 and 11, 11 coupled thereto and such that one conducts during one set of alternate half cycles of the alternating-current source to apply half-wave rectified current pulses to terminals 14, 15 of a switching network SN1 comprising four transistors whose emitter-collector paths are connected to form a bridge and the other conducts during the alternate set of alternate half cycles to apply half-wave rectified current pulses to terminals 18, 19 of a second switching network SN2 similar to network SN1, terminals 12, 13 of network SN1 and terminals 16, 17 of network SN2 being connected as shown to output terminals 5, 6 and the input signal being applied to a diode switching network PR to control the polarity with which the alternating current generated by inverter IC is applied to the primary winding T3(P) of a transformer T3 having four secondary windings coupled between the base electrodes of the transistors of the switching networks SN1, SN2 in such a fashion that for an input of one value one pair of transistors of each of switching networks SN1, SN2 is rendered conductive when the corresponding circuit 10, 10 or 11, 11 is energized to result in terminal 5 being sent positive with respect to terminal 6 and for an input of the other value the other pair of transistors of each of the switching networks SN1, SN2 is rendered conducting when its corresponding circuit 10, 10 or 11, 11 is energized to result in terminal 5 being sent negative with respect to terminal 6. Double-current telegraph signals having a maximum repetition rate low compared to the frequency of inverter IC applied at input terminals 7 are repeated with a reversal of polarity at output terminals 8. Thus if terminal 3 is positive with respect to terminal 4 diodes MR1, MR2 of network PR conduct so energizing transformer T3 that during the half cycles when transistor TR9 conducts and current flows anticlockwise in the circuit 10, 10 transistors TR1, TR4 conduct and a negative potential appears as terminal 5. During each following half cycle when current flows anticlockwise in circuit 11, 11, transistors TR5 and TR8 conduct and negative potential continues to appear at terminal 5. With a reversal of polarity at terminals 3, 4, transistors TR2, TR3 conduct alternately with transistors TR6, TR7 so that a positive potential appears at terminal 5.",ASS ELECT IND,REID ERIC ROBERT MCEWAN;;FOX MALCOLM JOHN,,https://lens.org/169-711-473-140-995,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H04L25/0268,,H3P PHAC          PHAC;;H3T TCF           TCF,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The method includes inserting a mounting member into an intramedullary canal of the femur and coupling a bridge member to the mounting member. The method also includes placing a cutting guide member over a medial anterior portion of the distal femur. The cutting guide member has a first channel that establishes the first reference plane. The bridge member has a bridge channel. A wall of the bridge channel is inserted into the first channel of the cutting guide member. A mounting mechanism generates resistance between the bridge member and the cutting guide member.
