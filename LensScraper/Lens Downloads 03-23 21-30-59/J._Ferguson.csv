The tube contains a round bore eccentrically disposed parallel within the tube having one end open at which to receive fluid pressure. By virtue of the eccentric relationship of the bore to the tube, an internal bending moment occurs under pressure loading that is proportional to the applied pressure and which bending moment causes the free closed end of the tube to deflect in a direction opposite to the direction to the which the bore was predisposed with respect to the OD center line of the tube. In a preferred embodiment, the unsupported free length of the tube is at least about 20 times the tube OD and for operating at the high pressure ranges, the tube is of a metal composition characterized by relatively high tensile yield strength in combination with a relatively low Young's elastic modulus. Various applications for use of the tube are disclosed including a pressure gauge, switch mechanism, etc.",DRESSER IND,FERGUSON WALTER J,DRESSER INC. A CORP.

The first and second shrouds extend radially over and are spaced from the respective radially extending first and second end portions of the rotor to respectively define radial inlet and outlet paths therewith. The first and second shrouds each have a first radially inner end adjacent and spaced from the shaft to define a gas inlet or outlet, respectively, and a second radial outer end mounted to the rotor adjacent and spaced apart the ventilation ducts for communicating gas between the ventilation ducts and the inlet and outlet paths. The second outlet shroud is spaced further from the shaft than the inlet shroud so as to facilitate the gas flowing in the inlet shroud and out the outlet shroud during normal machine operation. Fan motors are provided at the inlet and outlet of the shrouds to direct gas flow.

The linkage includes an inner first tube (12) and an outer second tube (14) arranged to move in telescoping fashion, a spring (16) being connected between the outer tube (14) and the inner tube (12). Within the outer tube (14) the inner tube (12) is connected to a stop assembly (50, 69, 78) also connected to the outer tube (14), which stop assembly (50, 69, 78) limits movement of the inner tube (12) with respect to the outer tube (14) to a selected range. A position sensor (66) is also connected between the two tubes (12, 14) within the second tube (14) to provide a signal indicative of relative movement, whereby the axial forces on the linkage are monitored as the signal from the position sensor (66) is related to movement in a known way and movement is related to applied force through the spring (16) in a known way.

The starter includes a starter drive which does not have an overrunning clutch. The pinion is meshed with the ring gear of an engine by a solenoid and is automatically disengaged from the ring gear by a spring when a system that responds to cranking motor speed deenergizes the solenoid. The starter includes a nose housing having a tubular bore which receives a pinion that closes the open end of the tubular bore except for some clearance between the outside of the pinion and the bore. A seal encircles the solid pinion and the pinion and seal serve to prevent foreign material from entering the interior of the starter. The seal also serves to wipe the tubular bore of the nose housing during movement of the pinion. The pinion is supported at its exterior by a bearing interposed between the exterior of the pinion and the wall defining the tubular bore in the nose casting. The pinion assembly therefore receives its primary support at its exterior and the pinion assembly has an internal helical spline connected with a sleeve member which can be axially reciprocated and rotatably driven by an armature shaft.,GEN MOTORS CORP,CARLSON J;;FERGUSON S,,https://lens.org/186-972-270-230-765,Granted Patent,no,5,17,3,3,0,F02N15/06;;Y10T74/132;;Y10T74/132;;F02N15/06,F02N15/06,074-007   A,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The loss of the prior command information is not a problem as the data rate of the serial link is still sufficiently high so that any minor transitory change which may have been desired would be of minimal effect in any regard and would have been inaudible to the human.",COMPAQ COMPUTER CORP,FERGUSON PATRICK L;;MAGUIRE DAVID J,COMPAQ COMPUTER CORPORATION (1994-04-14);;HEWLETT-PACKARD DEVELOPMENT COMPANY L.P (2001-06-20),https://lens.org/176-134-445-138-990,Granted Patent,yes,5,12,5,5,0,G06F5/10;;G06F7/00;;G06F2205/062;;G06F5/10;;G06F7/00;;G06F2205/062,G06F5/10;;G06F7/00,395/250;;364/238;;364/238.6;;364/239;;364/239.6;;X364DIG  1,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The visual editing system of the present invention features a fee setting tool that allows the developer to develop a fee structure for an online service. The fee structure can handle both fees levied against users and third party content providers. For example, users can be levied fees for logging onto an online service, performing searches, or downloading information. Third party content providers can be levied fees for submitting advertisements or for executing a transaction with a user. Similarly, the fee setting tool also allows the developer to assign a payment system whereby users or content providers can be paid for certain actions. A user may be paid when that user that fills out a marketing questionnaire or wins a contest.

In certain protocols of the present invention, the sport specific cuing may be characterized as a ""virtual opponent"", that may be kinematically and anthropomorphically correct in form and action. Though the virtual opponent could assume many forms, the virtual opponent is responsive to, and interactive with, the player in real time without any perceived visual lag. The virtual opponent continually delivers and/or responds to stimuli to create realistic movement challenges for the player. The movement challenges are typically comprised of relatively short, discrete movement legs, sometimes amounting to only a few inches of displacement of the player's center of mass. Such movement legs are without fixed start and end positions, necessitating continual tracking of the player's position for meaningful assessment.

The visual editing system of the present invention features a fee setting tool that allows the developer to develop a fee structure for an online service. The fee structure can handle both fees levied against users and third party content providers. For example, users can be levied fees for logging onto an online service, performing searches, or downloading information. Third party content providers can be levied fees for submitting advertisements or for executing a transaction with a user. Similarly, the fee setting tool also allows the developer to assign a payment system whereby users or content providers can be paid for certain actions. A user may be paid when that user that fills out a marketing questionnaire or wins a contest. A third party content provider can be paid when that third party content provider supplies valuable information desired by the users of the online service.",VERMEER TECH INC,FORGAARD RANDY J;;FERGUSON CHARLES H,,https://lens.org/140-306-407-774-365,Patent Application,no,0,0,9,9,0,G06Q30/04;;G06Q30/04;;G06F16/748;;G06F16/748;;G06F16/94;;G06F16/94;;G06F16/9558;;G06F16/9558;;G06Q20/10;;G06Q20/10;;G07F17/0014;;G07F17/0014,G06F15/00;;G06F13/00;;G06F17/30;;G06Q20/10;;G06Q30/04;;G07F7/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The visual editing system creates online services that consist of a number of subservices. Each subservice is a program that provides a particular type of functionality to the online service. Different subservices exist for displaying hypermedia documents, searching directories and databases, displaying classified advertisements, providing a bulletin board system, etc. Each subservice has an associated database of information and a collection of scripts that handle events such as input from a user. The visual editing system of the present invention features a fee setting tool that allows the developer to develop a fee structure for an online service. The fee structure can handle both fees levied against users and third party content providers. For example, users can be levied fees for logging onto an online service, performing searches, or downloading information. Third party content providers can be levied fees for submitting advertisements or for executing a transaction with a user. Similarly, the fee setting tool also allows the developer to assign a payment system whereby users or content providers can be paid for certain actions. A user may be paid when that user that fills out a marketing questionnaire or wins a contest. A third party content provider can be paid when that third party content provider supplies valuable information desired by the users of the online service.","VERMEER TECHNOLOGIES, INC.","FERGUSON, Charles, H.;;FORGAARD, Randy, J.",,https://lens.org/147-899-461-911-798,Search Report,yes,0,0,1,1,0,,G06F15/00;;G06F13/00;;G06F17/30;;G06Q20/10;;G06Q30/04;;G07F7/00,,0,0,,,,UNKNOWN

   In a printed wiring board, a plurality of stacked innerlayer panels have capacitors connected in parallel by connecting a first electrode of a first panel with a first electrode of a second panel, and similarly connecting second electrodes of the first and second panels. The innerlayer panel having capacitors connected in parallel provides a high capacitance in a small x-y area. An alternate printed wiring board has a capacitor having a first foil electrode, and second and third electrodes located on opposite sides of the first foil electrode. Yet another printed wiring board has capacitors formed as an array of discrete foil electrodes spaced from an array of discrete printed electrodes. Forming discrete interconnected electrodes allows the electrodes to be fired without excessive thermal coefficient of expansion stresses damaging the electrodes.

   A printed wiring board (PWB) has stacked innerlayer panels comprised of passive circuit elements. The passive elements can include capacitors with electrode terminations located within the footprints of the capacitor electrodes. The capacitor terminations are therefore closely spaced, reducing the capacitors' contributions to loop inductance in the innerlayer. Capacitor terminations within the electrode footprints also reduce the PWB board surface area used in forming the capacitors.

   This disclosure relates to a method for making a polymeric article mold, a method for making a polymeric article with that mold, and improved surface topography features for a polymeric article. A prototype article is formed and then coated with a thin conductive layer. The coated prototype article is then electroformed until nickel plated to a sufficient depth to define a nickel plating tool. After the prototype article has been removed from the mold face of the nickel tool, the tool can be used as a mold for forming finished polymeric articles which replicate the original prototype article. The use of fine topography features such as a dense upstanding stem array on the surface of the prototype article facilitates accurate and complete electroforming by increased surface area presentation. The disclosure also presents improvements to microreplicated surface structures such as stem arrays. The improvements include the formation on a stem array having separate zones of stems of differing heights, and the formation of directional microreplicated features (e.g., stems) which are oriented and shaped to promote or restrict frictional interaction in one or more particular directions.

The processor is basically a multiple instruction, multiple data stream (MIMD) digital computer that utilizes pipelining for control and function units, but avoids precedence constraint penalties. Task and instruction processing is carried on concurrently through the use of a snapshot taken of the next process status words (PSWs) to be serviced for each active task, the pointers for which are stored in task first in-first out buffers (task FIFOs). The PSWs, along with their parent task status words (TSWs), are placed into the control pipeline one at a time and serviced, after which each PSW pointer is placed back in the task FIFO from where it was taken. After all process status words of the snapshot have been entered into the control pipeline, a new snapshot is taken and the PSWs processed in the same manner. Instruction execution is carried out as the TSW/PSW pair proceeds through the control pipeline, during which time the required data operations are carried out by pulling operands from a memory unit, as required for execution of that particular instruction, and causing the same to be sent to the function units after which the results are placed in the memory unit. For interprocess data transfers, synchronization is accomplished through use of hardware implemented semaphores called a scoreboard. In addition, passage of data between processors and memories other than those associated, or local, memories, is through a memory switch.",DENELCOR INC,GILLILAND MAXWELL C;;SMITH BURTON J;;FERGUSON GARY L,CYBERCRAFT INC (1987-09-04);;BEHR VENTURE PARTNERS LTD.- 1983 (1989-01-16),https://lens.org/093-899-595-040-839,Granted Patent,yes,2,175,1,1,0,G06F9/3838;;G06F9/3851;;G06F9/462;;G06F9/4825;;G06F9/4881;;G06F9/4825;;G06F9/3838;;G06F9/462;;G06F9/4881;;G06F9/3851,G06F9/38;;G06F9/46;;G06F9/48,364/200,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The FPU determines whether a rounded value should be calculated for the finite nonzero number based on the plurality of status flags and whether the overflow flag is asserted. Upon determining that the rounded value should be calculated for the finite nonzero number based on the plurality of status flags and that the overflow flag is asserted, the FPU calculates the rounded value of the finite nonzero number based on an overflow rounding. Upon determining that the rounded value should be calculated for the finite nonzero number based on the plurality of status flags and that the overflow flag is not asserted, the FPU calculates the rounded value of the finite nonzero number based on a blended reduced precision rounding.",FERGUSON WARREN E;;HICKMANN BRIAN J;;FLETCHER THOMAS D,FERGUSON WARREN E;;HICKMANN BRIAN J;;FLETCHER THOMAS D,INTEL CORPORATION (2013-02-08),https://lens.org/100-845-707-104-664,Patent Application,yes,3,1,2,2,0,G06F17/10;;G06F17/10;;G06F7/00;;G06F7/00;;G06F7/4991;;G06F7/49942;;G06F7/49942;;G06F7/49968;;G06F7/49968;;G06F7/49973;;G06F7/49973;;G06F9/30014;;G06F9/30014;;G06F9/30094;;G06F9/30094,G06F17/10,708/497,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

    A rotary device, such as a downhole motor, with a rotary wave seal assembly. The seal assembly is formed by a sinuous or non-linear circumferential gland or groove and an annular seal member, such as an O-ring, supported in the groove. The device further includes at least one thrust bearing assembly for transmitting axial pressure from the bearing housing to the drive shaft. Each thrust bearing comprises a self-lubricating thrust washer as the bearing element. Still further, where the rotary device comprises two coaxial tubular structures that are not to rotate relative to each other, an anti-rotation means is provided. The anti-rotation means includes a cylindrical pin received in mating longitudinal, radiused grooves in the outer wall of the innermost elongate member and the inner wall of the outermost tubular member. The anti-rotation means includes a cylindrical pin received in the mating longitudinal grooves. This configuration allows axial, sliding movement of one tubular member relative to the other, but prevents rotational movement therebetween. Where the rotary device is a downhole motor, it further comprises a radial bearing sleeve positioned between the coaxial downhole ends of the universal housing and the connecting rod, above the bearing section of the motor. This sleeve acts as a barrier to prevent debris in the drilling fluid from moving into the bearing assemblies.

The cover comprises a roof opening in which the push element slides in opposing directions, advancing product from the interior of the cover onto the landing. In a preferred embodiment, the dispenser houses miniature zinc air batteries, secured to the base using an adhesive layer. When a cell is advanced from the interior of the cover onto the landing, the cell is separated from the adhesive layer, allowing air to pass into the cell and the cell to be activated. The landing preferably comprises a magnet for releasably securing product. The dispenser is then used as an inserter for orienting and placing the product in position in a device. The product is not directly handled during its removal from the dispenser or during its insertion into a device. In the case of a zinc air cell, the cell is untabbed without any direct handling of tab material by the user, and the material functioning as a tab stays with the dispenser upon separation from the cell.</PTEXT>",EVEREDY BATTERY CO INC,GARRANT S S;;HEDMAN J W;;FERGUSON M A,,https://lens.org/158-770-810-725-929,Granted Patent,no,0,0,17,25,0,B65D83/0409;;B65D83/0454;;B65D2313/04;;B65D2313/10;;B65D2583/0481;;H01M12/06;;Y02E60/10;;H01M50/216;;B65D83/0454;;B65D2313/04;;B65D83/0409;;H01M12/06;;B65D2583/0481;;B65D2313/10;;H01M50/216,B65D83/04;;H01M2/10;;H01M12/06,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Additionally, the error resulted from the reconciliation is input to an uncertainty model to predict the uncertainty in the predicted output. This is input to a decision processor (20) which is utilized to control the output control (14).

   This disclosure relates to a method for making a polymeric article mold, a method for making a polymeric article with that mold, and improved surface topography features for a polymeric article. A prototype article is formed and then coated with a thin conductive layer. The coated prototype article is then electroformed until nickel plated to a sufficient depth to define a nickel plating tool. After the prototype article has been removed from the mold face of the nickel tool, the tool can be used as a mold for forming finished polymeric articles which replicate the original prototype article. The use of fine topography features such as a dense upstanding stem array on the surface of the prototype article facilitates accurate and complete electroforming by increased surface area presentation. The disclosure also presents improvements to microreplicated surface structures such as stem arrays. The improvements include the formation on a stem array having separate zones of stems of differing heights, and the formation of directional microreplicated features (e.g., stems) which are oriented and shaped to promote or restrict frictional interaction in one or more particular directions.

The circuit also includes a voltage controlled current switch coupled in series to the fuse. The voltage controlled current switch is configured to enable current flow through the fuse in response to a supply voltage exceeding a threshold value associated with the overvoltage event. The current causes the fuse to switch from a closed state to an open state providing a non-volatile record of the overvoltage event. In some embodiments, the voltage controlled current switch can be a Zener diode with a breakdown voltage based on the threshold value, or a transistor configured to switch into conducting mode at the threshold value.

A garbage collector, which executes on said CPU, places a write barrier over certain portions of memory. Furthermore, it transfers an object from a location in the memory to a second object at another location in the memory. In a critical section, which may not be interrupted, it allocates sufficient space for the second object so that the entire contents from the first object can be copied into the second object, and in an interruptable section, it copies the entire contents of the first object into the second object. A write routine is linked into the application programs for updating objects in the computer memory.
