The local router may then receive data for those multicast groups and forward that data to user devices. For multicast groups identified in user device communications ascertained not to be permitted multicast groups, the local router sends no communications across the network-side interface requesting membership.

The diffusing section is generally rectangular in cross section perpendicular to the axis of the passage. Upstream and downstream longitudinally extending, spaced apart, facing surfaces of the diffusing section are joined together by a pair of spaced apart side walls which face each other and diverge from each other in the longitudinal direction toward the outlet of the passage. These side walls blend, along their length, with the downstream surface as a smooth curve of large radius. The diameter of the corner curvature of the passage is on the same order of magnitude as the distance between the upstream and downstream surfaces of the diffusing section at the location in question. The large corner curvatures, as opposed to filet radii, allow the side walls to diverge from each other at a greater angle without separation of the coolant fluid therefrom, permitting the spreading of smaller amounts of coolant air over a larger area of the airfoil external surface.",UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORP,FIELD ROBERT E,,https://lens.org/184-906-580-880-060,Granted Patent,no,0,0,15,15,0,F01D5/186;;F05D2250/12;;F05D2250/121;;F05D2250/71;;Y02T50/60;;F01D5/186;;F05D2250/12;;F05D2250/121;;F05D2250/71;;Y02T50/60,F01D5/18;;F01D9/02,170-71,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A transmitter is connected to the localization wire for transmitting a signal through the tissue so that the specified location can be accurately determined when the transmitter is placed thereat. A method of marking a specified location within tissue includes inserting a hollow introducer needle into the tissue until a tip of the needle reaches the specified location. A localization wire having a transmitter is then inserted into the hollow needle until the transmitter is positioned at the specified location. The hollow needle is then removed from the tissue such that only the localization wire and transmitter remain embedded therein. The transmitter is subsequently located by probing an outside surface of the tissue with a receiver until the maximum signal strength is achieved.

The diffusing section is generally rectangular in cross section perpendicular to the axis of the passage. Upstream and downstream longitudinally extending, spaced apart, facing surfaces of the diffusing section are joined together by a pair of spaced apart side walls which face each other and diverge from each other in the longitudinal direction toward the outlet of the passage. These side walls blend, along their length, with the downstream surface as a smooth curve of large radius. The diameter of the corner curvature of the passage is on the same order of magnitude as the distance between the upstream and downstream surfaces of the diffusing section at the location in question. The large corner curvatures, as opposed to filet radii, allow the side walls to diverge from each other at a greater angle without separation of the coolant fluid therefrom, permitting the spreading of smaller amounts of coolant air over a larger area of the airfoil external surface.",UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORP,FIELD ROBERT E,UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION (1985-12-10),https://lens.org/186-492-054-170-152,Granted Patent,yes,39,152,15,15,0,F01D5/186;;F05D2250/12;;F05D2250/121;;F05D2250/71;;Y02T50/60;;F01D5/186;;F05D2250/12;;F05D2250/121;;F05D2250/71;;Y02T50/60,F01D5/18;;F01D9/02,416 97R;;415/115,3,1,040-132-481-022-716,10.1016/s0065-2717(08)70020-0,"Flight and Aircraft Engineer, No. 2460, vol. 69, (3 16 56) pp. 292 295.;;Advances in Heat Transfer by Richard J.

The signal processing circuitry processes the head output signal to produce a data signal indicative of how much current appears to flow in the plate structure below the head. A driving voltage, which typically varies in a periodic manner to produce a characteristic signature, is applied to a primary conductor in the plate structure.

A communication is sent from a subscriber device to the first device requesting that the subscriber device be permitted to join a multicast group associated with data for a desired content. After determining that the subscriber device is authorized to receive that content, the first device sends one or more multicast signaling communications to a second device. The multicast signaling communications instruct the second device to join the requested multicast group and provide an identifier associated with that multicast group. After joining the multicast group and receiving content data packets of that group, the second device encapsulates those received packets in frames according to an access network media access control (MAC) protocol and forwards the MAC frames to the subscriber device. The MAC frames include the identifier provided to the second device by the first device.

    Inspection method and tool for flat panel displays for localizing short-circuit and open-circuit type defects for optional repair involves inducing a localized temperature change in the display and observing any electrical effect on the network formed by the rows and columns. In one embodiment, a laser is used to heat the rows and columns individually and the resulting time-dependent resistance changes or thermoelectric potentials result in electrical signals on the row and column shorting busses. The method can be used to identify crossings of conductors, which contain defects and may be further used to localize the defects within the crossing. Methods for enhancing the sensitivity of the method are also disclosed.

The first component, sometimes referred to herein as a suture introducer, locates the edges of the hole and passes wire suture through them. The second component, sometimes referred to herein as a suture tensioner, gathers the free ends of the wire suture and twists them together, which in turn closes the hole. After the wire suture has been twisted sufficiently to effect closure, the excess wire is trimmed away. The apparatus can deploy more than one wire suture at a time if desired. Using self-locating features and tactile feedback, the apparatus is particularly well adapted to access remote surgical sites.

The face electrode causes electrons moving from one of the plate structures to the other to be deflected in such a manner as to compensate for other electron deflection caused by the presence of the spacer. The face electrode is divided into multiple laterally separated segments (66.sub.1 -66.sub.N) to improve the accuracy of the compensation along the length of the spacer.

Consequently, the presence of the spacer does not significantly affect the trajectories of electrons moving from the backplate structure to the faceplate structures. Alternatively, the spacer is arranged to produce electron deflection that largely compensates for undesired electron deflection which occurs during earlier electron travel from the backplate structure to the faceplate structure.

Consequently, the presence of the spacer does not significantly affect the trajectories of electrons moving from the backplate structure to the faceplate structures.

The swirling of the fluid within the cylindrical channel helps diffuse the fluid such that the outlet slot becomes completely filled with coolant, whereby a film of coolant is created on the airfoil surface downstream of the slot over the full length of the slot.",UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORP,PHILLIPS JAMES S;;FIELD ROBERT E,UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION (1985-11-22),https://lens.org/037-979-351-258-857,Granted Patent,yes,44,91,15,15,0,F01D5/186;;Y02T50/60;;F01D5/186;;Y02T50/60,F01D5/18;;F01D9/02,416 97R;;415/115,3,1,040-132-481-022-716,10.1016/s0065-2717(08)70020-0,"Flight and Aircraft Engineer, No. 2460, vol. 69, 3 16 56, pp. 292 295.;;Advances in Heat Transfer, by Richard J.

    A spacer (  44  ) for a flat-panel display is formed with a main spacer portion (  60  ), typically shaped like a wall, and a face electrode (  66  ) situated over a face of main spacer portion. The spacer is inserted between two opposing plate structures (  40  and  42  ) of the display. The face electrode causes electrons moving from one of the plate structures to the other to be deflected in such a manner as to compensate for other electron deflection caused by the presence of the spacer. The face electrode is divided into multiple laterally separated segments (  66 _{ 1 }  -66 _{ N } ) to improve the accuracy of the compensation along the length of the spacer. A masking step is typically utilized in defining the widths of the segments of the face electrode.

CONSTITUTION: A voltage-adjustment section(20) of an electronic device converts an input control voltage(V1) into an output control voltage(V0) in such a way that a collector current(ICP) form with electrons emitted from an emitter(EP) of an emission/collection cell (26), or triode, varies in a desired, typically linear, manner with the input control voltage. The triode further includes a collector (CP) that carries the collector current and a gate electrode(GP) that regulates the collector current as a function of the output control voltage. Control of the collector current so as to achieve the desired current/voltage relationship is achieved with an analog control loop containing the triode and an amplifier(28) coupled between the triode's collector and gate electrode. The triode thus typically has a linear gamma characteristic relative to the input control voltage. The voltage-adjustment section is suitable for use in a display device such as a flat-panel display.",CANDESCENT TECH CORP,FIELD JOHN E;;HANSEN RONALD L;;SPINDT CHRISTOPHER J,,https://lens.org/067-031-620-376-643,Patent Application,no,0,1,11,11,0,G09G3/22;;G09G2310/027;;G09G2320/0276;;H01J2329/00;;G09G3/22;;H01J2329/00;;G09G2310/027;;G09G2320/0276,G09G3/20;;H01J1/304;;G09G3/22;;H05B37/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Side walls are positioned between the faceplate and the backplate. The side walls, faceplate and backplate form an enclosed sealed envelope. A plurality of phosphor subpixels are positioned at the faceplate interior side. A plurality of field emitters are positioned at the backplate interior side. The field emitters emit electrons which strike corresponding phosphor subpixels. A plurality of scattering shields surround each phosphor subpixel and define a subpixel volume. The scattering shields reduce the number of scattered electrons exiting from their corresponding subpixel volume. This reduces the number of scattered electrons from charging internal insulating surfaces in the envelope, as well as striking the non-corresponding phosphor subpixels.

Manual means are provided whereby an operator by manipulation of a control may determine vehicle speed; forward and reverse direction; and turning right or left. A variable voltage is responsive to the operator's movements for providing an electrical signal representative of the desired speed in either the forward or reverse direction. Other movements by the operator of the control provide turning in the right or left direction. The means for detecting a turning control signal from the operator is effective to reduce the motor drive signal to the motor on the inside of the desired turn, from the level representative of the existing speed toward a no-speed level at a programmed rate. The control further includes a proximity reverse sensing means effective to stop reverse movement of the vehicle upon sensing the presence of an operator closely adjacent the rear of the vehicle and for providing a short burst of forward movement of the vehicle upon such detection.

Once toner flow commences, the images are subjected to pressure high enough to force the toner into the substrate.

Once toner flow commences, the images are subjected to pressure high enough to force the toner into the substrate.

A vector incorporating a segment having a region of homology with a target chromosomal site of a host microorganism is severed at two sites outside of the segment to remove vector sequences and at a site within the region of homology to form two segment portions, each with a part of the region of homology at one end thereof. The segment is reassembled with one of said parts of the region of homology at each end and with the ends of the segment portions opposed to the parts of the region of homology connected together. The sequence desired for integration, such as a gene, may be incorporated in the segment either intermediate the regions of homology at the ends or they may form the regions of homology. Alternatively, the linear transforming segment is prepared by circularizing a DNA segment containing the desired sequence and having the region of homology and then amplifying this construct by inverse polymerase chain reaction. Host microorganisms are transformed with these segments to obtain transformants with reduced vector DNA and particularly amylolytic S. cerevisiae transformants incorporating glucoamylase genes of S. diastaticus.",INFERGENE COMPANY;;REYES ANNE M & EF,ESMON BRENT E;;LEGERTON TIMOTHY L;;AMSDEN AUBREY BRUCE;;FIELD CHARLES D,,https://lens.org/011-750-871-141-127,Patent Application,yes,0,75,1,1,0,C12N9/2428;;C12N9/12;;C12N15/64;;C12N15/81;;C12N15/905;;C12Q1/6844,C12N9/12;;C12N9/34;;C12N15/64;;C12N15/81;;C12N15/90;;C12Q1/68,,6,6,032-566-874-566-456;;006-112-413-313-270;;056-488-829-812-718;;014-297-768-114-215;;043-086-861-934-068;;006-321-525-013-038,2545533;;10.1016/0378-1119(89)90012-7;;10.1007/bf00330380;;3012280;;3556323;;10.1016/0378-1119(86)90327-6;;10.1016/0378-1119(85)90072-1;;2998940;;pmc413056;;10.1073/pnas.76.10.4951;;388424;;3014435;;pmc311485;;10.1093/nar/14.12.4701,"GENE, Volume 76, issued 15 March 1989, pp. 99-107, XIAO et al.: ""The construction of recombinant industrial yeast and free of bacterial sequences by directed gene replacement into a nonessential region of the genome"".
