CO. 28 Nov., 1967 [30 Nov., 1966; 2 Nov., 1967], No. 54082/67. Headings B3Q and B3U. A fluid-operated power tool comprises a cylinder 10 in which three pistons 26, 30 are slidably mounted in three chambers defined by plates 22. The pistons are spaced by cylindrical spacers 23 and the spacers and pistons are held together by a hollow tie rod 17. One end of the tie rod has a nut 16 screwed thereon which is slidable in a guide 13 mounted on the cylinder by split rings 15. The mandrel of a blind riveting assembly can be secured to the tie rod. In operation compressed air is admitted by a valve in the passage 39 to the annular manifold between the spacers and the tie rod. The fluid flows through gaps 31 between the spacers and recesses 36a, 36b, 36c in the pistons into the chambers. The plates 22 are not secured to the cylinder wall and are forced against split rings 15 by the air. The recesses 36a, 36b, 36c get progressively larger to admit equal quantities of air to each chamber. The rearmost piston abuts a resilient buffer 42 when the mandrel breaks. The valve is then moved so that the chambers may exhaust under spring bias 37. In an alternative embodiment the tool acts leftwards under air pressure and is returned rightwards under spring bias. The tool has a fixed anvil 52 and a crimping or clinching hammer 51. Alternatively the tool may have double-acting pistons and a valve 61 to supply air to either side of the pistons. To move the hammer against the anvil air is supplied through a passage 55 to the annular manifold. To retract the hammer air is supplied along passage 59 to the left of piston 30.",SCOVILL MANUFACTURING CO,FREEMAN RICHARD BENNETT,,https://lens.org/087-642-169-531-001,Granted Patent,no,0,2,4,6,0,B21J15/105;;F15B11/0365,B21J15/06;;F15B11/036,B3Q Q1G           -;;B3Q Q2F2          -;;B3Q Q4            -;;B3U U1D           -;;B3U U1L1          -;;B3U U1N           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

UNITED STATES ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION. July 10, 1957, No. 21825/57. Class 39 (4). A thermonuclear reactor comprises means for establishing an axially symmetric magnetic field having intensified reflector field regions in an evacuated space thereby defining a plasma containment zone, and means for introducing and trapping energetic fuel ions in the zone. In Fig. 21 a cylindrical container 41 is connected at one end to a vacuum pump and cold trap 43 and is surrounded by a solenoid 44 and by mirror coils 48 and 49. Ion sources 61 inject fuel ions into the container, the central field produced by solenoid 44 is intensified, and the magnetic mirrors are moved from the ends of the container towards the centre to compress the fuel axially; energy may be abstracted from the plasma by allowing it to expand and push the coils back to the ends of the container. The volumes indicated at 62 and 63 may be filled with material for utilizing neutron emission from the reaction space; this material may be lithium, for producing tritium, or a radiation adsorption material or a fissile material. The apparatus shown in Fig. 22 comprises three zones bounded by coils 77, 79, 81 and 78. The magnetic fields of coils 79 and 81 are less than those of coils 77 and 78, so that if a reaction is proceeding in zone 71 charged particles will escape preferentially through coil 79, rather than through coil 77, and will accumulate in zone 73. Subsequently coil 81 is translated to drive the fuel from zone 73 into a second section zone 72, and so on. Ion sources 61 supply the fuel to zones 71 and 72, and electron or gas sources (not shown) may be provided in zone 73 to neutralize the charge. The reaction zone may have a smaller diameter than the accumulator zone, Figs. 23 and 24 (not shown). A three-zone apparatus may be arranged in the form of an equilateral triangle, Fig. 25 (not shown), with toroidal segments joining the sides of the triangle.",ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION,POST RICHARD FREEMAN,,https://lens.org/080-572-282-380-262,Granted Patent,no,0,8,1,2,0,H05H1/14;;Y02E30/10,H05H1/14,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

April 16, 1962, No. 14574/62 Heading B8M. A reel, for supporting coils of metal strip, comprises an expansible, coil supporting drum carried by a rotatable arbor having an axial bore within which cam members can cause the drum to expand and contract. In one embodiment (Figs. 1 and 4), the drum of a reel for coiling strip has a fixed segment 12 connected to a sleeve 16 fitting around the arbor 11, and movable segments 13, 14 with tubular portion 19 pivoted to the segment 12. The segments are expanded by a wedge member 15 connected to various riser pins 41 having sleeves 44 and movable in slots 40 in the arbor. The pins have inner surfaces 43 which straddle a shaft 29 coaxial with the arbor and which engage cam surfaces 37 on cylindrical members 32, 33, 34, 35, closely fitting within the bore 27 of the arbor and spaced on the shaft 29 between collar 31 and nut 39. Hence by reciprocating the shaft 29 the drum is expanded and contracted. The reel may be disassembled by unscrewing the end plate 47 from the arbor, longitudinally withdrawing the segments 12, 13, 14 in one unit, and then by laterally removing the wedge 15 and pins 41 screwed thereto from the arbor. Slots 52 are provided for the insertion of the free end of the strip. A larger reel may be obtained by spacing the segments 12, 13, 14, further away from the arbor (Figs. 7 and 8, not shown). In another embodiment a reel, especially for gripping a coil during unwinding comprises four drum-forming segments each connected by pins 60 to a cylindrical cam member 57 within the arbor 55 and having cam surfaces 63 inclined to the axis of the cylinder 57 arid mating with the inner surfaces of the pins 60. The pins may be offset so that the surfaces 63 can extend beyond the centre of the cylinder 57 (Fig. 9, not shown).",HERR EQUIPMENT CORP,HERR RICHARD FREEMAN,,https://lens.org/030-715-173-671-484,Granted Patent,no,0,6,1,1,0,B21C47/30,B21C47/30,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The thickness of a strip 10 issuing from the stands 12, 14 of a rolling mill is measured by a radiation detector 62 coupled to a recording device 64. The measured thickness is compared with a desired thickness set by a target indicator 96, and an error signal representative of any difference is applied to the input of an amplifier 162 the output from which controls a servomotor 186 which repositions a vernier rheostat 32 in the control circuit of a motor 16 driving the stand 14 whereby the speed of the motor is varied and the strip tension thereby regulated to maintain the thickness constant. The servomotor 186 also drives a tachogenerator 204 which produces a second signal proportional to the speed of readjustment of the rheostat 32, and this second signal is applied to the input of the amplifier 162 in opposition to the error signal, so that the adjustments are performed in accordance with the time integral of the error signal.

The image signals can be dynamically ranked in a defined prioritized order, even on a field-by-field basis. However, rather than switch the individual image signals as their prioritized order changes, the order of the channels is dynamically and switchably interchanged within a keyer means by switchably interchanging a plurality of substantially identical keyer units while generating a plurality ofprocessed true transparency image key signals Pki. The keyer units are substantially identical in the sense that, while there may be some structural distinctions among the keyer units, there is a commonality of function among the keyer units within a keyer means. The keyer means also generates any needed processed background key signals PkB. The respective keyer units are switchably changeable to produce true transparency processed key signals, which are generated such that processed key signal Pki for an i-th channel is produced by the i-th respective one of the plurality of substantially identical keyer units within the keyer means. The i-th keyer unit is adapted to modify the value of its input key signal Bkj with the values of the input key signals Bkj in the higher priority channels to generate a true transparency processed key signal Pki for the i-th priority channel. A keyer unit within the keyer means generates the true transparency processed image key signal Pki for the i-th image signal so that: where B0 = 0 and so that Pk1 + Pk2 + ... + PkN + PkB = 1.0.

PATENT 3522 In one case, using the input key signals, a key-taken signal can be generated by multiplying a key-requested signal and a key-available signal while a key-now-available signal can be generated by algebraically subtracting the key-taken signal from the key-available signal.

In either case, the generated key-now-available signal can be coupled from a higher priority i-th channel to a lower priority (i+1)-st channel as the key-available signal for the lower priority (i+1)-st channel and the respective processed key signal Pki can be produced in response to the key-taken signal.",AMPEX,FREEMAN RICHARD D,,https://lens.org/063-182-367-260-315,Patent Application,no,0,0,2,7,0,H04N5/272;;H04N5/272;;H04N5/275;;H04N5/275,H04N5/272;;H04N5/275,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The sandwiched and wrapped foam core is then placed in a mold where the steel inserts are precision located on tooling pins, the mold is closed and plastic resin is injected thereby impregnating the fibers.

On the one hand, others have changed the order of the channels carrying the image signals as the priority of the image signals changes. On the other hand, here we interchange the order of a plurality of substantially identical keyer units within a keyer as the priority of the image signals changes. In interchanging the keyer units, true transparency processed key signals are also generated. In so doing that, the i-th keyer unit modifies the value of its input key signal Bk.sub.i using values of input key signals from higher priority channels. Thereby a true transparency processed key signal Pk.sub.i is generated for the i-th priority channel. In one embodiment, a key-taken signal is generated by multiplying a key-requested signal and a key-available signal while a key-now-available signal is generated by subtracting the key-taken signal from the key-available signal. In another embodiment, a key-taken signal is generated by subtracting a key-now-available signal from a key-available signal while a key-now-available signal is generated by multiplying the key-available signal by one minus the key-requested signal. In either embodiment, the generated key-now-available signal from a higher priority i-th channel is provided to a lower priority (i+1)-st channel as the key-available signal for the lower priority channel and the processed key signal Pk.sub.i is generated in response to the key-taken signal.",AMPEX SYSTEMS CORP,FREEMAN RICHARD D,AMPEX CORPORATION REDWOOD CITY CA A CORP.

As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, lid 2 may be clamped down by means of pivoted catches 5, the forked upper ends 5a of which are screw-threaded to receive a tapped cubiform block 6 secured by means of nuts 7, 8. Extending laterally from opposite sides of the block 6 are axially aligned trunnions 9 (Fig. 3) which seat in vertical recesses 10 formed in suitably spaced side plates 11, of a bracket 12 secured upon the top of lid 2. Screws 13 attach bearing plates 14 to the outer sides of plates 11. Welded upon the outer faces of filling-in plates 15, attached to the upper portions of the opposite sides of tank 1 are vertical channels 16, adapted to co-operate with feet 5b of pivot catches 5. Forked upper ends 5a may be connected by links 18 to a ""bell-crank"" plate 19 pivotally mounted at 20 and arranged to turn in a horizontal plane. Projecting upwardly from the apex of each plate 19 is a vertical pin 22 adapted to turn the plate against the action of a controlling spring 21 by a contact piece fixed on shaft 24. A hand wheel 29 may control through connexions axial displacement of shaft 24. By turning wheel 29 so as to effect movement of shaft 24 to the right, the two contact pieces will be caused to act upon pins 22 thereby <PICT:0869043/IV(c)/1> <PICT:0869043/IV(c)/2> <PICT:0869043/IV(c)/3> <PICT:0869043/IV(c)/4> <PICT:0869043/IV(c)/5> turning plates 19 against the action of springs 21 to effect simultaneous disengagement of all four pivoted catches 5. Conversely, rotation of the hand wheel 29 in the opposite direction will shift the shaft 24 to the left and move the contact pieces clear of pins 22 with the result that the springs 21 will react to restore plates 19 to their original positions and through links 18 swing catches 5 to lock lid 2. Mechanism is provided on top of the lid for automatically opening valve 35 by lifting it off its seat against the downward pull of a tension spring whenever the shaft is shifted axially to release the lid. As shown in Figs. 7 and 8 arms 42a and 42b of lever 42 may be rigidly secured to opposite ends of shaft 43 itself mounted to turn freely in bushes 44 secured within a bearing tube 45. Outer end of arm 42a may be pivotally connected by pin 47 to lug 48 and the corresponding end of arm 42b may be furnished with roller 49 arranged to be acted upon by a longitudinally extending straight cam 50 attached to shaft 24. Whenever shaft 24 is shifted axially to the right in Fig. 7 to release the lid, the roller 49 rides up an inclined leading end 50a of cam 50 with the result that lever 42 is turned upwardly to raise valve 35 off its seat.

Heat exchangers. FREEMAN, TAYLOR MACHINES Ltd. March 14, 1961 [March 14, 1960], No. 8912/60. Class 64 (3). Heat from waste liquor discharged from a group of dyeing or like wet treatment machines 1 to a common outflow line 4 and thence to a sump 5, is recovered in a heat exchanger 7, 7a which gives up this heat to fresh cold liquid being fed either directly, or indirectly e.g. by way of a storage tank 9, to the machines, the inflow and outflow to and from the respective machines being controlled by manually or automatically actuated valves such that hot waste liquor from one or some of the machines 1 may be discharged through the heat exchanger to heat up fresh liquid being supplied to another of the machines. In the system shown, when the drain valve 22 of any one or more of the machines is opened, hot waste liquor flows to the sump 5 and ultimately reaches the level of short probes 19 which switch on firstly the waste pump 6 and then the clean fluid inlet pump 10. Clean fluid after being heated in the heat exchanger 7, 7a flows through conduit 11 and then to the machines 1. As the machines become fully charged with clean liquor 2 the supply of hot waste liquor from the machines consequently diminishes, and the sump level drops until it reaches the low-level determined by probes 20 which then switch off the pumps. If during the recharging operation it should happen that the inlet valves 13 of all the machines are closed the pressure of the heated clean liquid leaving the heat exchanger will open a relief valve 14 allowing the liquid to flow into the storage tank 9. Subsequent opening of the inlet valve on any of the machines will then allow a flow of liquid from the storage tank to the machine by way of non-return valve 15. The heat exchanger may comprise a shell and tube type unit (Figs. 3 to 5, not shown) or a plurality of such units interconnected in series or in parallel. The heat exchanger may, in a modification (Fig. 2, not shown), be built into the tank 9.",FREEMAN TAYLOR MACHINES LTD,FREEMAN SAMUEL RICHARD THOMPSO,,https://lens.org/151-554-020-167-087,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,D06B23/22;;F28D21/0012;;Y02P70/62,D06B23/22,F4S S16A2         S16A2;;F4S S5E2          S5E2,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

As shown in Fig. 3, the paddle may have five equi-angularly spaced blades A, B, C, D, E. The blade-adjusting components may consist of discs 6, 7 (see Fig. 2) connected to the blades by links a, b, c, d, e, themselves keyed to a sleeve 8 mounted upon and rotatable about shaft 5. Sleeve 8 may be screw-threaded to receive locking ring 9 which may act as a clamp on disc 10 whereby discs 6, 7 and links a-e are held firmly. Spacer washer 13 may serve not only to space apart and so prevent interference between links a, c, d, but also may function when locking ring 9 is screwed up to transmit the locking action from links a, c at the inner side of disc 6 to link d at the opposite side of disc 7. Thus by manipulating locking ring 9 on sleeve 8 the desired projection or retraction of blades A-E can be achieved. Each blade A-E may have associated with it a mainly flat plate 15 which extends transversely right across the paddle from one circular end plate 1 to the other, the plate constituting a fixed inner section of the blade in relation to which the movable section of the blade is slidable radially inwards and outwards. Opposite marginal end portions of each transverse plate 15 may be bent at right angles to form flanges 15a by means of which the plate is secured e.g. by welding to the inner opposed faces of the circular end plates 1. Two narrow flat strips 16 of metal may extend alongside flanges 15a and serve as slideways upon which the adjustable blade may slide whenever it is adjusted. The inwardly directed portions of flanges 14a of the pair of guide angles 14 for each paddle blade may extend over the margins of the latter as shown in Fig. 7 such that the blade when adjusted may slide between the flanges and strips 16. The back of the central portion of the flange of the blade may have secured thereto a U or forked block 18 to receive the relevant end of the corresponding link to which it is pivoted by a pin 19.",FREEMAN TAYLOR MACHINES LTD,FREEMAN SAMUEL RICHARD THOMPSO,,https://lens.org/074-215-662-782-340,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,D06B5/12,D06B5/12,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Hot and wet material e.g. yarn in hanks or other forms, woven and knitted fabrics subsequent to a dyeing or analogous wet treatment, or granular and powdered materials, are dried in a closed vessel wherein the pressure is suddenly, i.e. in less than one minute, reduced to below atmospheric to create a vacuum and causing liquid in the material to flash off as a vapour carrying or entraining droplets of liquid, and condensing the flashed-off vapour. The drying rate may be substantially controlled by regulating the rate at which the partial vacuum is created in the vessel e.g. a vacuum of 25 inches of mercury in under one minute, the first few inches being generated very suddenly. The vacuum may be created by admitting low pressure steam e.g. 5 p.s.i. to exclude or expel air in the vessel and then rapidly condensing it. Flashed-off vapour and any low pressure steam may be condensed by a refrigerant, cooling the outer surfaces of the vessel, cooling coils or sprays therein.",FREEMAN TAYLOR MACHINES LTD,FREEMAN SAMUEL RICHARD THOMPSO,,https://lens.org/139-637-009-656-196,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,D06C7/00;;D06C2700/09,D06C7/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A format structure for storing retrievably encoded data on a recording medium is disclosed. A start field for indicating the start of a data file is provided. Immediately following the start field there provided an index field for storing indexing data respecting the data file. In the index field a sequence of one or more positions of other start fields leading in one direction from a current position on the medium toward one end of the medium is stored. Immediately following the index field there is a field for storage data, which forms the data file. A method for storing encoded data on a storage medium is also disclosed. The last file stored on the medium is located. The index field of the last stored file is then retrieved. The index field associated therewith is duplicated for later use. The system then moves the storage medium to the end of the last stored file. At the current position of the medium a filemark is inserted. Then a final leaf block is inserted having a new entry containing the entry key of the new file and the current position of the medium. The indexing data is stored immediately following the filemark and finally the encoded data is stored immediately following the indexing data.

An oscillating voltage is applied to the series combination of the junction and the inductor, the voltage having a fundamental frequency near but above the resonant frequency and an amplitude greater than a predetermined level which is in the range of 3-5 volts. Finally, the device under test is rejected should an output taken across the pn junction show a substantial frequency component below the fundamental frequency.",GA TECHNOLOGIES INC,IKEZI HIROYUKI;;FREEMAN RICHARD L,GENERAL ATOMICS (1988-02-01);;GA TECHNOLOGIES INC.

The capacity of one of the turbines ( 24 ) may be varied, for example by means of guide vanes ( 32 ) which can be adjusted to reduce or increase a throat area ( 40 ) through which air leaves the guide vanes to impact the turbine. The capacity of the turbine may be increased at low engine speeds, to reduce the pressure ratio across the turbine and across the compressor ( 16 ) which it drives, thereby improving the surge margin of the compressor.

PAL colour television signals, in which the subcarrier reference "" burst "" not only provides synchronizing information for the receiver reference oscillator but also alternates in phase about the - Q axis as illustrated in Figs. 1 (a) and 1 (b) for the purpose of signalling the line sequential phase reversal of the I modulation axis, are demodulated by an arrangement as shown in Fig. 2, comprising I and Q synchronous demodulators 3, 4 and a reference oscillator 1 which is established at the mean (- Q) phase of the alternating ""bursts"" applied through gate 2 and supplies a Q reference output to demodulator 4 and a I reference output to demodulator 3 via a switched inverter operating a line frequency, the arrangement being characterized by the provision of a second gate 7 which applies the output of demodulator during the "" burst "" to establish the line sequential operation of inverter 5 in the correct phase. In an alternative arrangement (not illustrated in detail) a third synchronous demodulator operating with the reference output from inverter 5 is used to provide the "" burst "" signal via gate 7 to the inverter. The signal via gate 7 is of the same polarity for successive "" bursts "" due to the line sequential phase inversion of the I reference signal, but changes in polarity should the phase of the line sequential operation of inverter 5 become incorrect. A polarity responsive device, such as a rectifier diode, is utilized to detect the signal polarity and apply a correction to the inverter. The inverter may comprise a diode switch controlled by a multivibrator driven by line frequency synchronizing pulses, the signal from gate 7, in the event of incorrect polarity, being applied to temporarily alter the multivibrator cycling time so as to reestablish operation in the correct phase. Reference is made to arrangements for use where the quadrature modulation axes are other than I and Q, e.g. R-Y, and B-Y.

Television; multiplex radio signalling. MULLARD Ltd. 6 April, 1966 [15 July, 1965; 12 Nov., 1965], Nos. 30075/65 and 48119/65. Headings H4F and H4L. A method of television transmission consists of transmitting a majority of fields appertaining to a normal continuous (BTV) programme whilst interposing at intervals a minority of fields appertaining to a dis-continuous (ETV) programme constituted by a series of still pictures or other still information not conveying motion. The invention is described primarily as applied to educational television, where the still pictures comprise the educational material, but reference is made to the use of the invention for sending monitoring or warning information. In the simplest method of operation a single field of the ETV programme is inserted after every forty-nine fields of the BTV programme. An identification signal precedes the inserted field to permit its separation and utilization at a special receiver. In a normal receiver the inserted fields may be suppressed, but if displayed introduce only limited interference with the BTV programmes. In a second method, two ETV fields, which may be time adjacent or separated, are inserted, the signal in one field being inverted with respect to that of the other. At a special receiver the two fields are separated out and the one which is inverted is restored to normal polarity for use. At a normal receiver the inserted fields cancel visually. The effectiveness of the cancellation depends upon the manner of applying gamma correction at the transmitter. The specification discusses a first method which produces complete cancellation at a normal receiver but requires extra circuits at the special receiver to obtain proper gamma correction, and a second method which produces proper gamma correction at the special receiver but incomplete cancellation at a normal receiver. The ETV fields may be transmitted with reduced amplitude or with an amplitude selected or controlled automatically in accordance with the mean level of the BTV signal. The timing of the ETV fields may be controlled so that they are not inserted in the BTV signal where there is a large difference in the levels of the signals. In a third method of operation, two fields are inserted, one consisting of the sum and the other of the difference of the ETV and BTV signals. In a normal receiver the inserted fields combine visually to produce a half amplitude effect due to the BTV signal alone, whilst in a special receiver, in which the fields are separated and one inverted, a half amplitude effect due to ETV signal alone is produced. The effectiveness of the operation depends upon the manner of applying gamma correction and this is discussed in the Specification. Identification signals are inserted in the composite signal to indicate the presence of inserted fields and to distinguish one from the other. The signal may comprise a single pulse for one field and two for the other inserted in each of six successive lines in the field blanking intervals which precede the inserted fields. The pulses may comprise "" bursts "" of oscillation. In a special receiver, the identification signals are separated from the composite signal and employed to open a gate to separate the inserted ETV fields from the BTV signals. A switch is also controlled so as to pass one of each pair of fields through an inverter. The fields are then stored (e.g. in a cathode-ray tube store or magnetic tape or drum arrangement) so that they may be read out continuously to a cathode-ray display tube. A single store may be used, Fig. 1 (not shown), and the BTV component of the sum and difference signals is cancelled by visual integration in the display. Alternatively, where the two inserted fields form an interlaced pair the read-out for a cathode-ray tube store may be with an elongated beam so as to produce the mean of successive pairs of lines. Reference is also made to the use of four fields, two interlaced fields with sum signal and two with a difference signal. The two pairs of fields are superposed in the store so that the summation occurs in the storage target. Alternatively a pair of stores may be used. With two inserted fields, one field of each pair goes to one store and the other field to the second store. The stores are read out simultaneously to the display. This arrangement reduces the vertical resolution to one half. With four inserted fields normal resolution may be obtained. Where the stores require an appreciable time for priming and erase operations, additional control signals may be transmitted in advance of the main identification signals. In a fourth method of operation the sum and difference signals are sent alternately at line rate during two inserted interlaced fields, the sum signals being sent on the odd lines and the difference signals on the even lines of both fields. Alternatively four fields are sent and the oddeven sequence is reversed for the third and fourth fields. The phase of the sum-difference sequence is indicated by additional line back porch pulses or by pulses inserted in alternate lines of the field blanking interval. Reference is also made to a method in which an inserted field consists of alternate lines inverted in polarity.",MULLARD LTD,JACKSON RICHARD NORMAN;;FREEMAN KENNETH GEORGE,,https://lens.org/095-589-021-817-409,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,4,0,G09B5/02;;G09B5/02;;H04N1/00098;;H04N1/00098;;H04N7/002;;H04N7/002,G09B5/02;;H04N1/00;;H04N7/00,H4F FD12C         44;;H4F FD12C         5;;H4F FD12M         44;;H4F FD12M         5;;H4F FD22          44;;H4F FD22          5;;H4F FD24          44;;H4F FD24          5;;H4F FD26X         44;;H4F FD26X         5;;H4F FD30A         44;;H4F FD30A         5;;H4F FD30D         44;;H4F FD30D         5;;H4F FD30G         44;;H4F FD30G         5;;H4F FD30T         44;;H4F FD30T         5;;H4F FD30V         44;;H4F FD30V         5;;H4F FD40S         44;;H4F FD40S         5;;H4F FGG           GG,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Preferably, the heating zones (18a-18d) are provided by way of a series of induction coils (16a-16d) disposed along the axial length and circumferential portion of the tube (26). Each induction coil (16a-16d) can be individually energized so that select portions of the tube (26) are heated in a controlled manner.",BUDD CO,FREEMAN RICHARD B;;HANDLEY MARK C,,https://lens.org/078-107-447-635-222,Patent Application,yes,5,6,8,8,0,B21D26/033;;B21D26/033;;B21D37/16;;B21D37/16;;Y10T29/49805;;Y10T29/49805,B21D26/033;;B21D37/16;;B21D41/02,,1,0,,,See also references of EP 1011888A4,PENDING

A transmitter for producing a chrominance carrier signal as described in Specification, 1,005,696, which comprises a. first component Á = a(R - Y) + a(B - Y) and a second quadrature component p = b(R - Y) - b(BY) which is reversed in phase (- p) in alternate lines, also includes means for producing between lines a synchronizing carrier "" burst "" signal B1 which is switched to a quadrature phase position B2 following alternate lines. The phase, of the signal B1 equals that of one of the components Á, p or the inversion thereof. As illustrated the phase of signal B1 corresponds to the inverse of the phase of component Á whereby the mean phase of B1 and B2 coincides with the axis, - (B - Y), occupied by the "" burst "" in conventional N.T.S.C. and P.A.L. systems. In alternative arrangements the mean phase may coincide with the + (B - Y), + (R - Y) or - (R - Y) axis. The ""` burst "" signal is produced by pulses from a source (4), Fig. 2 (not shown), which are applied to the quadrature modulators (1) and (2) via a switch (5) which is'changed over at line rate. The"" burst ""signals are established in the appropriate quadrant by choice of polarity of the pulses in relation to that of the colour modulating signal.

Each of the CMOS switches includes a pair of CMOS transistors (84, 86) with their drain terminals connected to form the input (46) and output (50) terminals of a bidirectional switch. Because the CMOS switch is bidirectional, its input and output terminals are interchangeable. A pair of CMOS transistors receives a differential drive signal at their gate terminals to enable the CMOS switch. The CMOS switch is biased so that when it is in an enabled state, a signal appearing at the input is conducted to the output. The present invention is optimized to provide rapid switching speeds of less than 5 nsec between ON and OFF transistor switching states, a low ON-resistance of less than 25 ohms, a high density configuration of multiple CMOS switches, and the ability to control the CMOS switches with standard logic-level signals.",APPLIED MICROSYSTEMS CORP,MORAN RICHARD P;;FREEMAN MARK S,,https://lens.org/082-890-198-672-170,Patent Application,yes,0,0,1,1,0,H03K17/6872;;H03K17/693,H03K17/687;;H03K17/693,,1,0,,,"ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS AND APPLICATIONS vol. 9, no. 1, 1989, EINDHOVEN NL pages 19 - 30 VOLGERS 'HCMOS analog switches and multiplexers/demultiplexers'",PENDING

The cutter (26) is actuated depending upon the label length and the offset between the label and an associated registration mark to ensure that the web is cut in the correct position. The web feed and cutter actuations are computer controlled and the machine can be programmed with cutter length and offset so that the machine can cut labels of any length (within the physical limits) without changing the machine parts. The invention also discloses a novel label web feeding arrangement.

An improved cell rack module includes at least one movable platen having a plurality of pin assemblies removably secured thereto. The movable platen is slidably movable within the cell rack module between an extended position or a retracted position. Extension mechanisms are used to force the movable platen into the extended position during calibration, charging and testing procedures, and retraction mechanisms return the platen to the retracted position when the extension mechanisms are not actuated. When the movable platen is in the extended position, the pin assemblies are maintained in electrical contact with either the battery cells associated with a conventional cell tray or contact plates associated with a calibration tray. In this situation, the pin assemblies allow for current and voltage signal transmission between charging and testing circuitry and the battery cells or contact plates. Each pin assembly can be quickly and easily disconnected from the movable platen and replaced if it becomes damaged or worn out. Each calibration tray includes control circuitry that is electrically connected to the charging and testing circuitry via certain pin assemblies.

Control of D.C. motors. ASSOCIATED ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES Ltd. 11 July, 1968 [14 July, 1967], No. 32595/67. Heading H2J. The hoisting and lowering speed ranges of a crane or the like driven by an electric motor are rendered inversely proportional to the load by control apparatus wherein at full load and at low speeds on no load the field current of the motor is maximum and all speed variation is achieved by varying armature voltage only, and at higher speeds on no load or part load variation is achieved by weakening the field. A demanded-speed reference signal s is fed from controller CT to armature voltage regulator AR which provides an armature voltage signal a and an armature current signal b, the signal a being positive for hoisting, negative for lowering and proportional to the demanded speed signal s, while signal b is postive when hoisting, negative when lowering light loads, and positive when overhauling (i.e. during regenerative lowering of a heavy load). Signal a is fed to a circuit A (detailed in Fig. 3, not shown) which provides a proportional negative output after signal a exceeds a threshold value in either direction. Signal b is fed to a circuit B (detailed in Fig. 4, not shown) which provides a proportional positive output whenever signal b departs from zero. The outputs from A and B are added and fed to circuit C (detailed in Fig. 5, not shown) which provides a positive output signal c (of limited maximum) when the input is negative but no output if the input goes positive. Signal c is fed to a field current regulator FR in opposition to a constant bias signal bs which keeps the field strength at maximum when c is zero. Circuit parameters are chosen such that when hoisting or lowering on full load signals a and b cancel each other and c is zero. At less than full load signal a predominates and causes field weakening in dependence upon armature current. Thus the speed/load characteristics are substantially identical for hoisting and lowering (Fig. 1, not shown).",ASS ELECT IND,AMEY MICHAEL EDWARD FREEMAN;;DAVIES RICHARD EDWARD,,https://lens.org/145-857-938-297-804,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B66C13/24;;G06G7/28,B66C13/24;;G06G7/28,H2J JD            JD(DC);;H2J J12NX         J2BG;;H2J J2B1          -;;H2J J2C           -;;H2J J2F1          -;;H2J J2GX          -;;H2J J2J3          J2BG,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Rinsing fluid supply nozzles (48) and suction nozzles (50) project downwardly from the head (46). The nozzles can be lowered into a row of wells in the plate (14) by movement of the head (46) about a pivot (55). The carriage (16) containing the plate (14) is moved under the nozzles to align a row of wells beneath them in order to perform a washing operation. The washing process comprises filling the wells with rinsing fluid from the supply nozzles (48) and evacuating the fluid by means of the suction nozzles (50). The raising and lowering of the dispensing head and the movement of the carriage are effected by stepper motors (36 and 57) controlled by a preprogrammed microprocessor. The microprocessor offers several different washing cycles from which the user can select one suitable for his requirements. In one cycle the carriage is caused to move to and fro whilst the suction nozzle is evacuating the wells so that the side walls of the well are brought up to the nozzle enabling the fluid that tends to collect in the corners of the wells to be removed. In another cycle the suction nozzle is positioned just above the level of the upper surface of the microtitration plate. Rinsing fluid is supplied to the well whilst suction is supplied to the well. The well is overfilled without the rinsing fluid overflowing into adjacent wells because of the section nozzle. In this way the wells can be washed to the top. The supply of rinsing fluid to the wells is metered by timing the period for which the supply valve (84) is opened. To ensure that the flow through the valve is at a uniform rate, the output of the pump (80) is smoothed by passing it through a length of flexible walled tubing (82) and an adjustable restrictor valve (91).",FLOW LAB,FREEMAN RICHARD HARRY MARK;;YEUDALL ABRAM DAVID,,https://lens.org/098-683-161-989-544,Patent Application,yes,4,12,5,7,0,B08B3/02;;B08B3/02;;B01L3/5085;;B01L13/02;;B01L13/02;;B01L2200/0642;;B01L2300/0829,G01N35/02;;B01L99/00;;B08B3/02;;G01N33/543,A4F FT27          FT27;;B1X X8            X8,0,0,,,,PATENTED

There are difficulties in reliably fitting and sealing these pipette tips onto the nozzles. The present invention simplifies the fitting and sealing of pipette tips onto nozzles by forming each nozzle with an annular groove having a controllably variable axial width. An elastomeric O-ring seal is fitted in each annular groove. The nozzle and its fitted O-ring seal is inserted into a pipette tip, and then the axial width of the annular groove is controllably reduced to cause a circumferential expansion of the O-ring seal. The nozzle and the pipette tip become mechanically and sealingly attached without the pipette tip having to be force-fitted onto the nozzle as was previously necessary. The pipette tip is subsequently detached by controllably increasing the axial width of the annular groove to allow a circumferential contraction of the O-ring seal. Manufacturing tolerances in the pipette tips do not have an adverse effect on the resultant nozzle/tip seal.

There are difficulties in reliably fitting and sealing these pipette tips onto the nozzles. The present invention simplifies the fitting and sealing of pipette tips onto nozzles by forming each nozzle with an annular groove having a controllably variable axial width. An elastomeric O-ring seal is fitted in each annular groove. The nozzle and its fitted O-ring seal is inserted into a pipette tip, and then the axial width of the annular groove is controllably reduced to cause a circumferential expansion of the O-ring seal. The nozzle and the pipette tip become mechanically and sealingly attached without the pipette tip having to be force-fitted onto the nozzle as was previously necessary. The pipette tip is subsequently detached by controllably increasing the axial width of the annular groove to allow a circumferential contraction of the O-ring seal.

SOLUTION: A helical magnetic field which crosses an electric field in a plasma chamber structured of an inner wall and an outer wall, is generated and a variety of plasmas are made to pass through the plasma chamber at a speicifed velocity. Consequently, the high mass particle is discharged to the outer wall and the low mass particle is trapped in the chamber and thus it is possible to separate both particles from each other.",ARCHIMEDES TECH GROUP INC,PUTVINSKI SERGEI;;FREEMAN RICHARD L;;OHKAWA TIHIRO,,https://lens.org/126-247-167-081-943,Patent Application,no,0,0,5,5,0,B03C1/023;;B03C1/288;;H01J49/328;;B03C1/023;;B03C1/288;;H01J49/328,B01J19/08;;G21K1/00;;H01J49/30;;H01J49/26;;H01J49/46,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

There are difficulties in reliably fitting and sealing these pipette tips onto the nozzles. The present invention simplifies the fitting and sealing of pipette tips onto nozzles by forming each nozzle with an annular groove having a controllably variable axial width. An elastomeric O-ring seal is fitted in each annular groove. The nozzle and its fitted O-ring seal is inserted into a pipette tip, and then the axial width of the annular groove is controllably reduced to cause a circumferential expansion of the O-ring seal.

[Also in Division F4] Apparatus for applying successive metal casings made from metal blanks to successive refractory articles comprises first bend means for bending said metal blank along the bottom edges of said refractory article, second bend means for bending said metal blank along the top edges of said refractory article to cover four surfaces of said refractory article with a pair of opposite ends of said metal blank substantially meeting on one said surface forming a metal wrapped refractory article, and means for securing together said opposite ends of said metal blank. Metal blanks 56 are fed in succession from feed means 53 to conveyer belts 69, 70 driven through belt and pulley means 72, 71 from an idler gear 41 supporting an intermittently driven conveyer chain 37. Bricks 55 move in succession down rollers 80 to rest against a stop-plate 84 over the chain conveyer 37 and above a blank 56. Projections 38 on the chain 37 push the bricks 55 off the rollers 80 on to longitudinal guide brackets above a blank 56. At a station 57, with a brick 55 on a blank 56 supported on longitudinal guides 107, the blank is bent by rollers 97, Figs. 8, 9, up along the sides of the brick, the bending occurring at rows of perforations in the blank. Each roller 97 is urged by a spring 104, Fig. 9, towards the brick and is raised by a plate 103 lifted by hydraulic cylinder means 111, the brick being held down during this operation by a ball-and-socket mounted clamp 124 moved down by hydraulic cylinder means 119. At the next station 58 rollers 145 bend the ends of the blank over the top of the brick, Fig. 11. The rollers 145 are urged downwardly by springs and are moved in by hydraulic cylinder means 158. Spring- urged clamps 139 hold the blank against the sides of the brick during bending and an upper clamp 168 holds the top of the brick during the initial part of the bending.

Guards, controlling.-The guard for a power or other press is arranged so that the two hands of the operator are required for starting the press, and means are also provided for closing the guard should the ram accidentally fall. The starting-lever j is returned to the out of gear ' position by a spring and is retained in that position by means of a weighted detent k, which is released by a projection a<1> on the guard a when the guard is moved to the closed position against the action of a spring. Thus, in starting the press, one hand of the operator is required to retain the guard, while the other hand is employed in moving the lever j. A quadrant f adjustably connected to the press ram e. carries a roller engaging a lever c pivoted at one end to a bar b carried by the press and engaging through a roller c<3>, an inclined plate d on the guard. Should the ram fall, the lever e is depressed and forces the guard to the closed position, removing the operator's arm out of danger. The sudden movement of the guard causes abnormal depression )f a buffer n and enables a detent o to engage a pin p on the guard to retain it in the closed position.

SOLUTION: The multi-mass filter for separating particles corresponding to a mass-charge ratio includes a chamber for receiving multi-kind of plasma including particles (M1<M2<M3) having various mass-charge ratios. A radial electric field is crossed to a magnetic field in the chamber defining an axis (E×B) to transport the particles (M1, M2, M3) to first, second and third areas in the respective orbital. In one embodiment, the filter is constituted such that az2Bz is retained to a constant according to the formula of separation mass: Mcz=eaz2Bz2/(8Vctr).

When a user defines the first path on the WORM volume, a first file directory group (140) is created for that path. A path directory entry pointing to this file directory group is written to the path directory group (130). Files having this path name are initially written into the first data file area (150) next to this file directory group. The first data file area grows as data is written into it. When a second path is defined, the first data file area is closed and a second file directory group (160) is created on the WORM volume next to the first data file area, thereby wasting little if any space. The path directory group is updated with a new path directory entry that points to this new file directo­ry group. Files having this second path name are written into a growing second data area. If the user now wants a file having the first path name to be written to the disk, a file directory entry is placed in the first file direc­tory group, but the file itself is written into the grow­ing second data file area. In this manner, files are associated with directory entries by a common path name, not necessarily physical location on the disk, although files tend to be relatively close to their associated directory entry.
