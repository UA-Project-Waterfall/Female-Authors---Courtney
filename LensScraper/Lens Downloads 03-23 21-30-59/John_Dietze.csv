The apparatus includes a base plate. The base plate has on one face a rail seat region on which the inner stock rail sits when the slide chair assembly is in use. A resilient rail fastening clip restrains the inner stock rail. A locating means locates the rail fastening clip in a first position. A loading means vertically deflects the clip so as to produce a load in a toe portion of the clip. A second locating means holds the rail fastening clip in a second position different from the first position such that the toe portion of the clip sits on a ramp of the loading means in a preload condition in which the clip does not bear on the rail,PANDROL LTD;;VAE EISENBAHNSYSTEME GMBH;;VAE GMBH;;VOESTALPINE BWG GMBH & CO KG,SEELEY DAVID RONALD;;OSSBERGER;;LEITNER;;DIETZE;;PORRILL JOHN PHILLIP;;HOEHNE,,https://lens.org/050-102-315-510-357,Granted Patent,no,0,0,31,31,0,E01B9/54;;E01B9/58;;E01B9/54;;E01B9/54;;E01B9/58,E01B9/54;;E01B9/58,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
