After allowing the solution to uniformly disperse among the fibers, so that the monomer intimately contacts the fiber surfaces, polymerization of the monomer on the fiber surfaces is initiated by a polymerization initiator for the monomer, and the polymerization is continued for a sufficient time to allow substantial graft polymerization of the monomer on the fibers to modify the surface properties of the fibers. The fibers are preferably scoured prior to the treatment process, and after polymerization the fibers are rinsed to remove acid and excess homopolymer prior to dyeing and/or further processing of the fibers. The fibers may be in the form of knitted, woven or nonwoven fabrics, and may include mixtures of fibers such as acrylic yarns and nylon filaments or polyester and cotton staple fiber blends.",INT YARN CORP OF TENNESSEE,DYER MICHAEL E,INTERNATIONAL YARN CORPORATION OF TENNESSEE INC.

Data from one or more input channels is temporarily stored in random access memory by the controller in data words representative of energy consumed in predetermined time (""demand"") intervals. The accumulated measurement (""event"") data and time reference data are transferred to a non-volatile, solid state memory at the end of relatively long collection periods which comprise a number of demand intervals. The solid state preferably is energized by the controller only during data transfers. The entire memory module is removable for processing at a central location, and it is replaced with a new one when it is removed. During memory replacement, which may occur at most times with minor exception, the processor prepares a special Removal Record and transfers that record to predetermined locations on the memory module being removed. The processor also prepares a special Insertion Record for the new module. The cumulative counts recorded on these special records as well as the normal records establish reliable data continuity. A field test enables testing of the meter, data inputs and processing circuitry in the field.

    An embodiment of a memory controller that improves processor to graphics device throughput by reducing the frequency of retries of postable write transaction requests is disclosed. The memory controller includes a posted write buffer and a timeout counter. The memory controller is coupled to a processor via a host bus and is also coupled to a graphics device via a graphics bus. If the posted write buffer is unavailable when a first postable write transaction request is received by the memory controller, the memory controller stalls the host bus and waits for the posted write buffer to become available. If a second transaction request is received while the posted write buffers are unavailable, the timeout counter is initiated. If the posted write buffer becomes available before the timeout counter expires, the first postable write transaction request is completed. If, however, the timeout counter expires before the posted write buffer becomes available, the memory controller issues a retry response to the processor, indicating to the processor that the first postable write transaction request must be reissued at a later time.

Data from one or more input channels is temporarily stored in random access memory by the controller in data words representative of energy consumed in predetermined time (""demand"") intervals. The accumulated measurement (""event"") data and time reference data are transferred to a non-volatile, solid state memory at the end of relatively long collection periods which comprise a number of demand intervals. The solid state preferably is energized by the controller only during data transfers. The entire memory module is removable for processing at a central location, and it is replaced with a new one when it is removed. During memory replacement, which may occur at most times with minor exception, the processor prepares a special Removal Record and transfers that record to predetermined locations on the memory module being removed. The processor also prepares a special Insertion Record for the new module. The cumulative counts recorded on these special records as well as the normal records establish reliable data continuity. A field test enables testing of the meter, data inputs and processing circuitry in the field. Further, the identification data (I.D.) may be set on the recorder in the field after installation or replacement.

The surface of a three dimensional figure is conceptually divided into small areas, and the effective surface normal for each of these areas is related to the surface normal of a unit sphere tessellated into a similar number of small areas or tiles. A quantized normal is defined to be the tile number on the surface of the unit sphere. For a particular three dimensional figure, instead of storing surface unit normal values of {X,Y,Z} for each coordinate, the quantized surface normal value (i.e., the tile number) is stored. Thus, for a surface normal expressed in Cartesian coordinates, a compression ratio of 6:1 is possible depending upon the memory required to store real and integer values and the desired accuracy. Efficient computational methods for compressing the surface normal by obtaining the appropriate tile number and the inverse expansion of the quantized surface normal into surface normals are described. Regardless of the initial length of the surface normal, the resultant of the combined compression-expansion process is a surface normal of unit length which is the format expected by most standard graphics libraries.",HEWLETT PACKARD CO,DYER DON W;;MARTZ PAUL E;;MORRISON TERESA M,HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY (1998-05-20),https://lens.org/136-129-353-302-784,Granted Patent,yes,2,20,2,2,0,G06T9/001;;G06T9/001,G06T9/00,345/429,2,1,191-910-280-996-77X,10.1109/svv.1996.558039,"Excerpt from the World-Wide-Web Site: /home/martz/normals/shpere.faq printed Apr. 7, 1997 and entitled: Topics On Sphere Distributions.

The surface of a three dimensional figure is conceptually divided into small areas, and the effective surface normal for each of these areas is related to the surface normal of a unit sphere tessellated into a similar number of small areas or tiles. A quantized normal is defined to be the tile number on the surface of the unit sphere. For a particular three dimensional figure, instead of storing surface unit normal values of {X,Y,Z} for each coordinate, the quantized surface normal value (i.e., the tile number) is stored. Thus, for a surface normal expressed in Cartesian coordinates, a compression ratio of 6:1 is possible depending upon the memory required to store real and integer values and the desired accuracy. Efficient computational methods for compressing the surface normal by obtaining the appropriate tile number and the inverse expansion of the quantized surface normal into surface normals are described. Regardless of the initial length of the surface normal, the resultant of the combined compression-expansion process is a surface normal of unit length which is the format expected by most standard graphics libraries.",HEWLETT PACKARD CO,DYER DON W;;MARTZ PAUL E;;MORRISON TERESA M,,https://lens.org/043-561-146-093-714,Granted Patent,yes,1,4,2,2,0,G06T9/001;;G06T9/001,G06T9/00,345/420,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A central controller stores user demographics and performance information, and provides this information as well as program criteria and evaluations to any of a plurality of exercise stations. The exercise stations each include a magnetic brake for producing the desired resistance levels. A central processor unit (CPU) controls the exercise program at each station. The initial brake resistance is established based upon user demographic information and initial user performance of an exercise. The brake resistance is represented by lights in an LED stack simulating weights which move up and down along a run in conformity with position of a movement arm which the user moves. A pacer light moving adjacent the LED weight stack guides the user at a desired pace throughout each repetition.

The exercise stations each include a magnetic brake for producing the desired resistance levels. A central processor unit (CPU) controls the exercise program at each station. The initial brake resistance is established based upon user demographic information and initial user performance of an exercise. The brake resistance is represented by lights in an LED stack simulating weights which move up and down along a run in conformity with position of a movement arm which the user moves. A pacer light moving adjacent the LED weight stack guides the user at a desired pace throughout each repetition. User performance including rate and limb extension is monitored and resistance is changed during the exercise period as performance corresponds to selected criteria. The user's performance is evaluated based on performance history and demographically-based criteria to provide coaching comments to the user and to propose changes to the exercise program.

A central controller stores user demographics and performance information, and provides this information as well as program criteria and evaluations to any of a plurality of exercise stations. The exercise stations each include a magnetic brake for producing the desired resistance levels. A central processor unit (CPU) controls the exercise program at each station. The initial brake resistance is established based upon user demographic information and initial user performance of an exercise. The brake resistance is represented by lights in an LED stack simulating weights which move up and down along a run in conformity with position of a movement arm which the user moves. A pacer light moving adjacent the LED weight stack guides the user at a desired pace throughout each repetition. User performance including rate and limb extension is monitored and resistance is changed during the exercise period as performance corresponds to selected criteria. The user's performance is evaluated based on performance history and demographically-based criteria to provide coaching comments to the user and to propose changes to the exercise program.

    A method and system for remotely calibrating a headset telephone with a reliable, accurate and easy to use user interface is provided. This method makes use of the remote programmability of advanced telephone headsets and DTMF signal encoding and permits the customer-user to instigate the calibration procedure with an ordinary telephone call. The invention provides the means by which the optimum settings can be transmitted to the headset, loaded and stored in the headset, thereby improving the audio quality of telephone headsets by providing adjustment steps for such audio qualities as microphone gain (transmit level), speaker gain, background noise and echo cancellation, filter functions and diagnostics. This method also provides audio feedback to a customer service representative performing the calibration to insure that the commands and adjustments were properly received. It also incorporates a remote override and storage process, as well as a security gateway to ensure that only authorized changes are made in the programming of the headset. This invention contemplates the audio problems inherent in advanced telephone headsets and provides a user-friendly, reliable and programmable solution.

A clamp is utilized to axially affix either one centralizer or multiple centralizers to the stress joint. The clamp is comprised of a plurality of sections with cylindrical interior surfaces which are tightened together using fasteners. The cylindrical interior surfaces avoid damage to the insulation layer which may be elastomeric. The clamp and each centralizer have radially directed projections thereon which interlock the clamp with each centralizer.
