A user accesses a website with a web browser. When a web page from the website is loaded into the user's browser, a client-side variable is set to a particular value, such as the current time. When the web page from the website is unloaded from the browser, a hidden pop-up window is loaded. The hidden pop-up window is programmed to sleep and then check the value of the client-side variable. A change in the value of the client-side variable indicates a new web page from the same web server has been loaded into the web browser and the user has not left the website. However, if a web page from a different web server is loaded into the browser, then the value of the client-side variable remains unchanged. Consequently, when the hidden pop-up window awakes and checks the value of the client-side variable, the pop-up window can determine whether the user has left the original website.

In use of the apparatus, a holding unit housing at lest one insect that responds in a detectable manner to the target odour is associated with the detector unit. A sample of gas to be tested is supplied to the apparatus, for exposure to the insect or insects in the holding unit. The insect is monitored for a response indicative of the target odour, thus enabling determination as to whether or not the target odour is present in the sample. Because the holding unit is not part of the detector unit but is removably associated with therewith, the holding unit can be used to transport an insect or insects housed therein from a first, remote location, e.g. where insects are raised and conditioned, to a point of use at a second location where the detector unit is located.

A user accesses a website with a web browser. When a web page from the website is loaded into the user's browser, a client-side variable is set to a particular value, such as the current time. When the web page from the website is unloaded from the browser, a hidden pop-up window is loaded. The hidden pop-up window is programmed to sleep and then check the value of the client-side variable. A change in the value of the client-side variable indicates a new web page from the same web server has been loaded into the web browser and the user has not left the website. However, if a web page from a different web server is loaded into the browser, then the value of the client-side variable remains unchanged. Consequently, when the hidden pop-up window awakes and checks the value of the client-side variable, the pop-up window can determine whether the user has left the original website. If the user has left the original website, the pop-up window is displayed.

In use of the apparatus, a holding unit housing at lest one insect that responds in a detectable manner to the target odour is associated with the detector unit. A sample of gas to be tested is supplied to the apparatus, for exposure to the insect or insects in the holding unit. The insect is monitored for a response indicative of the target odour, thus enabling determination as to whether or not the target odour is present in the sample. Because the holding unit is not part of the detector unit but is removably associated with therewith, the holding unit can be used to transport an insect or insects housed therein from a first, remote location, e.g. where insects are raised and conditioned, to a point of use at a second location where the detector unit is located.

When the web page from the website is unloaded from the browser, a hidden pop-up window is loaded. The hidden pop-up window is programmed to sleep and then check the value of the client-side variable. A change in the value of the client-side variable indicates a new web page from the same web server has been loaded into the web browser and the user has not left the website. However, if a web page from a different web server is loaded into the browser, then the value of the client-side variable remains unchanged.

   A method of collecting participant replies into a database residing on computing devices. The participant replies provide information of particular interest about the participant. The replies are provided in response to questions selected by an overseer. The questions are grouped into question sets; each question set addressing a particular aspect of information being sought. The question sets are further grouped into lists of the question sets determined by an overseer in accordance with the participant replies, wherein each participant is assigned a list. The invention establishes data paths over communication networks for communicating the questions and replies. For each participant a next question in the list is determined based on the participant's previous replies. The determined next question is communicated to the participant via the data path and the replies are communicated back from the participant via the data path. After all the questions on the list are asked a report is created and forwarded to the overseer who may change the make up of the list of question sets for the participant.

    A device for mechanically isolating the media tape reel of a data tape cartridge from its outer protective housing utilizes a compliant, cylindrical object. The object prevents relative movement between the reel and the housing in three degrees of freedom. The object is inserted into an opening in the housing of the tape cartridge for applying force against the reel. The compliant nature of the object allows it to be retained in the opening and engage the hub of the reel. The reel is pushed and held against an inner surface of the housing to prevent axial, radial, and rotational motion of the reel relative to the housing.

The band may be reflowed in order to provide the encapsulation of the conductors. The band may further be used to create a seal together with the surrounding lead body and an additional object such as a stiffener rod, stylet tube, and/or molding stylet, to allow a proximal area of a lumen of the lead body to be injection molded while prevent the injection molding material from proceeding past the band. When a stiffener rod is present in a proximal area of the lead and/or lead extension, additional stiffness is provided to the lead body to resist buckling of the lead body during insertion of the proximal end.

In various aspects a vehicle operating environment may be monitored by one or more sensors associated with a first vehicle operating within the vehicle operating environment. The first vehicle may be determined to be in proximity to a second vehicle based upon sensor data obtained from the one or more sensors. An identifier associated with the second vehicle may be determined based upon the sensor data and the identifier may be used to receive evaluation data associated with the second vehicle. The evaluation data may indicate a quality level associated with operation of the second vehicle. Based upon the evaluation data, it may be determined that the second vehicle is associated with a heightened risk of a vehicle accident.

In various aspects, sensor data is received at one or more sensors associated with a vehicle, where the sensor data defines an electronic vehicle environment that indicates an electronic location of the vehicle. An electronic pedestrian or cyclist location is identified within the electronic vehicle environment, which is determined by a mobile device associated with a pedestrian or cyclist. Where a determination is made that the pedestrian or cyclist meets predetermined alert criteria based upon the electronic vehicle location and the electronic pedestrian or cyclist location, an alert is generated that indicates the presence of the pedestrian or cyclist within the vicinity of the vehicle.

In various aspects a vehicle operating environment may be monitored by one or more sensors associated with a first vehicle operating within the vehicle operating environment. The first vehicle may be determined to be in proximity to a second vehicle based upon sensor data obtained from the one or more sensors. An identifier associated with the second vehicle may be determined based upon the sensor data and the identifier may be used to receive evaluation data associated with the second vehicle. The evaluation data may indicate a quality level associated with operation of the second vehicle. Based upon the evaluation data, it may be determined that the second vehicle is associated with a heightened risk of a vehicle accident. A warning regarding the heightened risk may be generated and presented, by an output device, to a vehicle operator of the first vehicle.",STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE CO,FIELDS BRIAN MARK;;CIELOCHA STEVEN C;;ALT JACOB J;;UPHOFF LAURA A;;CHAN LEO NELSON;;WAZEER MOHAMED A;;GAUDIN KRISTOPHER KEITH;;DAVIS JUSTIN;;BAUMANN NATHAN W;;ROLL GILES,STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE COMPANY (2016-09-07),https://lens.org/055-791-747-869-927,Granted Patent,yes,461,129,20,20,0,H04W4/02;;H04W4/46;;H04W4/44;;G08G1/096725;;G08G1/096758;;G08G1/0112;;G08G1/0129;;G08G1/07;;G08G1/096783;;G08G1/162;;G08G1/163;;G08G1/164;;G06Q50/00;;G08G1/096791;;G08G1/166;;Y02D30/70;;G08G1/096791;;H04W4/024;;G08G1/162;;G08G1/164;;H04W4/46;;H04W4/44;;H04W4/02;;G08G1/0129;;G08G1/0112;;G08G1/096783;;G08G1/096758;;G08G1/07;;G08G1/163;;G06Q40/08;;G08G1/096725;;G06Q50/00;;G08G1/0116;;G08G1/0133;;G08G1/0137;;B60T17/22;;H04N5/33;;H04N7/183;;H04N7/188;;G06N20/00;;G09B9/052;;G09B19/14;;G06V20/58;;G06F18/214;;H04N23/65;;G07C5/008;;G07C5/02;;G07C5/0816;;B60Q9/008;;G08G1/166;;G08G1/096827;;G08G1/096844,G08G1/00;;G08G1/0968;;G08G1/16,,129,7,043-790-215-470-560;;053-134-173-469-058;;067-095-278-458-370;;059-094-041-035-893;;033-988-082-910-403;;033-988-082-910-403;;037-513-242-742-215,10.1098/rsta.2010.0110;;20819826;;10.3233/wor-2012-0982-5882;;22317718;;9439023;;10.1109/iros.2010.5651993;;10.1111/j.1559-1816.2000.tb02463.x;;10.1111/j.1559-1816.2000.tb02463.x;;10.1109/isda.2008.358,"“Driverless Cars . . .

Various aspects include detecting, via one or more processors associated with a first vehicle, that an abnormal traffic condition exists in an operating environment of the first vehicle. An electronic message is generated and transmitted wirelessly, via a vehicle-mounted transceiver associated with the first vehicle, to alert a nearby vehicle of the abnormal traffic condition and to allow the nearby vehicle to avoid the abnormal traffic condition. The first vehicle receives telematics data regarding operation of the nearby vehicle after the nearby vehicle received the electronic message, and transmits the telematics data to a remote server for updating a vehicle-usage profile associated with the nearby vehicle.",STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE CO,FIELDS BRIAN MARK;;CIELOCHA STEVEN C;;ALT JACOB J;;UPHOFF LAURA A;;CHAN LEO NELSON;;WAZEER MOHAMED A;;GAUDIN KRISTOPHER KEITH;;DAVIS JUSTIN;;BAUMANN NATHAN W;;ROLL GILES,STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE COMPANY (2016-09-07),https://lens.org/026-433-069-459-045,Granted Patent,yes,548,135,20,20,0,H04W4/02;;H04W4/46;;H04W4/44;;G08G1/096725;;G08G1/096758;;G08G1/0112;;G08G1/0129;;G08G1/07;;G08G1/096783;;G08G1/162;;G08G1/163;;G08G1/164;;G06Q50/00;;G08G1/096791;;G08G1/166;;Y02D30/70;;G08G1/096791;;H04W4/024;;G08G1/162;;G08G1/164;;H04W4/46;;H04W4/44;;H04W4/02;;G08G1/0129;;G08G1/0112;;G08G1/096783;;G08G1/096758;;G08G1/07;;G08G1/163;;G06Q40/08;;G08G1/096725;;G06Q50/00;;G08G1/0116;;G08G1/0133;;G08G1/0137;;B60T17/22;;H04N5/33;;H04N7/183;;H04N7/188;;G06N20/00;;G09B9/052;;G09B19/14;;G06V20/58;;G06F18/214;;H04N23/65;;G07C5/008;;G07C5/02;;G07C5/0816;;B60Q9/008;;G08G1/166;;G08G1/096827;;G08G1/096844,G08G1/0967,,316,9,043-790-215-470-560;;053-134-173-469-058;;067-095-278-458-370;;059-094-041-035-893;;033-988-082-910-403;;033-988-082-910-403;;037-513-242-742-215;;166-981-196-322-133;;149-261-986-805-939,10.1098/rsta.2010.0110;;20819826;;10.3233/wor-2012-0982-5882;;22317718;;9439023;;10.1109/iros.2010.5651993;;10.1111/j.1559-1816.2000.tb02463.x;;10.1111/j.1559-1816.2000.tb02463.x;;10.1109/isda.2008.358;;10.1109/itsc.2012.6338904;;10.1145/375735.376310,"“Driverless Cars . . .

Various aspects include detecting, via one or more processors associated with a first vehicle, that an abnormal traffic condition exists in an operating environment of the first vehicle. An electronic message is generated and transmitted wirelessly, via a vehicle-mounted transceiver associated with the first vehicle, to alert a nearby vehicle of the abnormal traffic condition and to allow the nearby vehicle to avoid the abnormal traffic condition. The first vehicle receives telematics data regarding operation of the nearby vehicle after the nearby vehicle received the electronic message, and transmits the telematics data to a remote server for updating a vehicle-usage profile associated with the nearby vehicle.",STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE CO,FIELDS BRIAN MARK;;CIELOCHA STEVEN C;;ALT JACOB J;;UPHOFF LAURA A;;CHAN LEO NELSON;;WAZEER MOHAMED A;;GAUDIN KRISTOPHER KEITH;;DAVIS JUSTIN;;BAUMANN NATHAN W;;ROLL GILES,STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE COMPANY (2016-09-07),https://lens.org/089-824-611-820-923,Granted Patent,yes,1080,2,20,20,0,H04W4/02;;H04W4/46;;H04W4/44;;G08G1/096725;;G08G1/096758;;G08G1/0112;;G08G1/0129;;G08G1/07;;G08G1/096783;;G08G1/162;;G08G1/163;;G08G1/164;;G06Q50/00;;G08G1/096791;;G08G1/166;;Y02D30/70;;G08G1/096791;;H04W4/024;;G08G1/162;;G08G1/164;;H04W4/46;;H04W4/44;;H04W4/02;;G08G1/0129;;G08G1/0112;;G08G1/096783;;G08G1/096758;;G08G1/07;;G08G1/163;;G06Q40/08;;G08G1/096725;;G06Q50/00;;G08G1/0116;;G08G1/0133;;G08G1/0137;;B60T17/22;;H04N5/33;;H04N7/183;;H04N7/188;;G06N20/00;;G09B9/052;;G09B19/14;;G06V20/58;;G06F18/214;;H04N23/65;;G07C5/008;;G07C5/02;;G07C5/0816;;B60Q9/008;;G08G1/166;;G08G1/096827;;G08G1/096844,G08G1/0967,,634,18,149-261-986-805-939;;043-790-215-470-560;;103-294-521-335-270;;098-184-264-738-32X;;117-209-340-951-858;;030-969-017-968-120;;053-134-173-469-058;;067-095-278-458-370;;059-094-041-035-893;;097-519-903-848-230;;073-400-323-490-296;;103-948-562-219-858;;018-125-227-317-989;;090-700-834-170-551;;037-661-967-484-721;;166-981-196-322-133;;096-814-235-852-458;;037-513-242-742-215,10.1145/375735.376310;;10.1098/rsta.2010.0110;;20819826;;10.1109/dasc.2002.1052941;;10.1109/5254.736001;;10.1007/978-3-662-45854-9_5;;10.1080/00423110600563338;;10.3233/wor-2012-0982-5882;;22317718;;9439023;;10.1109/iros.2010.5651993;;10.1109/syscon.2015.7116764;;10.1016/j.trc.2012.10.003;;26087371;;pmc4507678;;10.3390/s150614162;;10.1109/green.2010.5453797;;10.1186/s13673-014-0019-5;;10.1109/acc.2012.6315654;;10.1109/itsc.2012.6338904;;10.1109/inftech.2008.4621607;;10.1109/isda.2008.358,"U.S. Appl.

In various aspects a vehicle operating environment may be monitored by one or more sensors associated with a first vehicle operating within the vehicle operating environment. The first vehicle may be determined to be in proximity to a second vehicle based upon sensor data obtained from the one or more sensors. An identifier associated with the second vehicle may be determined based upon the sensor data and the identifier may be used to receive evaluation data associated with the second vehicle. The evaluation data may indicate a quality level associated with operation of the second vehicle. Based upon the evaluation data, it may be determined that the second vehicle is associated with a heightened risk of a vehicle accident. A warning regarding the heighted risk may be generated and presented, by an output device, to a vehicle operator of the first vehicle.",STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE CO,FIELDS BRIAN MARK;;CIELOCHA STEVEN C;;ALT JACOB J;;UPHOFF LAURA A;;CHAN LEO NELSON;;WAZEER MOHAMED A;;GAUDIN KRISTOPHER KEITH;;DAVIS JUSTIN;;BAUMANN NATHAN W;;ROLL GILES,STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE COMPANY (2016-09-07),https://lens.org/010-588-725-196-796,Granted Patent,yes,1073,9,20,20,0,H04W4/02;;H04W4/46;;H04W4/44;;G08G1/096725;;G08G1/096758;;G08G1/0112;;G08G1/0129;;G08G1/07;;G08G1/096783;;G08G1/162;;G08G1/163;;G08G1/164;;G06Q50/00;;G08G1/096791;;G08G1/166;;Y02D30/70;;G08G1/096791;;H04W4/024;;G08G1/162;;G08G1/164;;H04W4/46;;H04W4/44;;H04W4/02;;G08G1/0129;;G08G1/0112;;G08G1/096783;;G08G1/096758;;G08G1/07;;G08G1/163;;G06Q40/08;;G08G1/096725;;G06Q50/00;;G08G1/0116;;G08G1/0133;;G08G1/0137;;B60T17/22;;H04N5/33;;H04N7/183;;H04N7/188;;G06N20/00;;G09B9/052;;G09B19/14;;G06V20/58;;G06F18/214;;H04N23/65;;G07C5/008;;G07C5/02;;G07C5/0816;;B60Q9/008;;G08G1/166;;G08G1/096827;;G08G1/096844,G08G1/16;;G08G1/0968,,630,19,043-790-215-470-560;;053-134-173-469-058;;067-095-278-458-370;;059-094-041-035-893;;033-988-082-910-403;;037-513-242-742-215;;149-261-986-805-939;;103-294-521-335-270;;098-184-264-738-32X;;117-209-340-951-858;;030-969-017-968-120;;097-519-903-848-230;;073-400-323-490-296;;103-948-562-219-858;;018-125-227-317-989;;090-700-834-170-551;;037-661-967-484-721;;166-981-196-322-133;;096-814-235-852-458,10.1098/rsta.2010.0110;;20819826;;10.3233/wor-2012-0982-5882;;22317718;;9439023;;10.1109/iros.2010.5651993;;10.1111/j.1559-1816.2000.tb02463.x;;10.1109/isda.2008.358;;10.1145/375735.376310;;10.1109/dasc.2002.1052941;;10.1109/5254.736001;;10.1007/978-3-662-45854-9_5;;10.1080/00423110600563338;;10.1109/syscon.2015.7116764;;10.1016/j.trc.2012.10.003;;26087371;;pmc4507678;;10.3390/s150614162;;10.1109/green.2010.5453797;;10.1186/s13673-014-0019-5;;10.1109/acc.2012.6315654;;10.1109/itsc.2012.6338904;;10.1109/inftech.2008.4621607,"“Driverless Cars . . .

Various aspects include detecting, via one or more processors associated with a first vehicle, that an abnormal traffic condition exists in an operating environment of the first vehicle. An electronic message is generated and transmitted wirelessly, via a vehicle-mounted transceiver associated with the first vehicle, to alert a nearby vehicle of the abnormal traffic condition and to allow the nearby vehicle to avoid the abnormal traffic condition. The first vehicle receives telematics data regarding operation of the nearby vehicle after the nearby vehicle received the electronic message, and transmits the telematics data to a remote server for updating a vehicle-usage profile associated with the nearby vehicle.",STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE CO,FIELDS BRIAN MARK;;CIELOCHA STEVEN C;;ALT JACOB J;;UPHOFF LAURA A;;CHAN LEO NELSON;;WAZEER MOHAMED A;;GAUDIN KRISTOPHER KEITH;;DAVIS JUSTIN;;BAUMANN NATHAN W;;ROLL GILES,STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE COMPANY (2016-09-07),https://lens.org/082-094-460-760-444,Granted Patent,yes,1075,15,20,20,0,H04W4/02;;H04W4/46;;H04W4/44;;G08G1/096725;;G08G1/096758;;G08G1/0112;;G08G1/0129;;G08G1/07;;G08G1/096783;;G08G1/162;;G08G1/163;;G08G1/164;;G06Q50/00;;G08G1/096791;;G08G1/166;;Y02D30/70;;G08G1/096791;;H04W4/024;;G08G1/162;;G08G1/164;;H04W4/46;;H04W4/44;;H04W4/02;;G08G1/0129;;G08G1/0112;;G08G1/096783;;G08G1/096758;;G08G1/07;;G08G1/163;;G06Q40/08;;G08G1/096725;;G06Q50/00;;G08G1/0116;;G08G1/0133;;G08G1/0137;;B60T17/22;;H04N5/33;;H04N7/183;;H04N7/188;;G06N20/00;;G09B9/052;;G09B19/14;;G06V20/58;;G06F18/214;;H04N23/65;;G07C5/008;;G07C5/02;;G07C5/0816;;B60Q9/008;;G08G1/166;;G08G1/096827;;G08G1/096844,G08G1/0967,,643,20,043-790-215-470-560;;053-134-173-469-058;;067-095-278-458-370;;059-094-041-035-893;;033-988-082-910-403;;033-988-082-910-403;;037-513-242-742-215;;166-981-196-322-133;;149-261-986-805-939;;103-294-521-335-270;;098-184-264-738-32X;;117-209-340-951-858;;030-969-017-968-120;;097-519-903-848-230;;073-400-323-490-296;;103-948-562-219-858;;018-125-227-317-989;;090-700-834-170-551;;037-661-967-484-721;;096-814-235-852-458,10.1098/rsta.2010.0110;;20819826;;10.3233/wor-2012-0982-5882;;22317718;;9439023;;10.1109/iros.2010.5651993;;10.1111/j.1559-1816.2000.tb02463.x;;10.1111/j.1559-1816.2000.tb02463.x;;10.1109/isda.2008.358;;10.1109/itsc.2012.6338904;;10.1145/375735.376310;;10.1109/dasc.2002.1052941;;10.1109/5254.736001;;10.1007/978-3-662-45854-9_5;;10.1080/00423110600563338;;10.1109/syscon.2015.7116764;;10.1016/j.trc.2012.10.003;;26087371;;pmc4507678;;10.3390/s150614162;;10.1109/green.2010.5453797;;10.1186/s13673-014-0019-5;;10.1109/acc.2012.6315654;;10.1109/inftech.2008.4621607,"“Driverless Cars . . .
