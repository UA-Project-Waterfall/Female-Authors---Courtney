    Systems and methods for controlling a polyphase brushless direct current (DC) motor (  12  ) are described. One system includes a meter (  14  ) coupled to a motor terminal (A, B, C) and adapted to produce a range of digital output values (  44  ) representative of a motor terminal signal from which a back EMF signal is derivable. The system (  10  ) also may include a controller (  16  ) that is coupled to the meter (  14, 42  ) and is operable to monitor the range of meter output values and to compute a motor commutation time based upon a monitored local minimum meter output value and a monitored local maximum meter output value. A pulse width modulation (PWM) circuit (  26  ) may be provided, and the meter (  14, 42  ) may be synchronized with the PWM circuit (  26  ). Zero crossings in the back EMF signals are identified based upon direct measurements of the signals at the motor terminals (A, B, C). In this way, sensors and complex circuitry, such as an ASIC or a plurality of comparators, that typically are used to determine when zero crossings occur are avoided. Furthermore, because the local maximum values and the local minimum values may be measured periodically (e.g., once every driving cycle), the invention readily accommodates component drifts and temperature variations.

The joints have axially facing rotational engagement surfaces that can be splined or otherwise made engageable, and are displaceable toward and away from one another, the latter preferably by a spring coupling that is axially limited in extension. The rotational engagement surfaces resist rotation when engaged. A line such as a cable traverses the joints and normally applies tension via a spring, causing all the joints to lock and to hold the supporting platform at a given position and orientation. A manually operable control is provided to extend the length of the line and disengage all the joints simultaneously, whereupon the support platform can be moved freely to a new position anywhere in a three dimensional range, as well as tilted, etc. The control is released at the new position to again hold the platform in place.

The manner of mounting the palm rests permits each palm rest to swivel about a generally vertical swivel axis and, additionally, move hingeally about a hinge axis that extends in a plane generally perpendicular to the associated swivel axis. The palm rests are connected to sets of torsion springs or the like to normally bias the palm rests about both the swivel axes and the hinge axes for clamping. Likewise, the sliding action of the carriage is preferably normally biased for clamping as well. Overall, the carriage, dual palm rests and biasing cooperatively effect a multiply adjustable clamping action on the from edge of the item.

The joints have axially facing rotational engagement surfaces that can be splined or otherwise made engageable, and are displaceable toward and away from one another, the latter preferably by a spring coupling that is axially limited in extension. The rotational engagement surfaces resist rotation when engaged. A line such as a cable traverses the joints and normally applies tension via a spring, causing all the joints to lock and to hold the supporting platform at a given position and orientation. A manually operable control is provided to extend the length of the line and disengage all the joints simultaneously, whereupon the support platform can be moved freely to a new position anywhere in a three dimensional range, as well as tilted, etc. The control is released at the new position to again hold the platform in place.",KNOLL INC,COPELAND STEPHAN;;GREENE H PETER;;MCALLISTER MICHAEL,WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC CORPORATION (1994-08-09);;KNOLL INC (1996-02-29),https://lens.org/168-396-019-505-284,Granted Patent,yes,30,55,1,4,0,A47B21/0314;;A47B2021/0321;;A47B2021/0335;;A47B2021/0342;;A47B2200/009;;A47B2210/15;;F16M11/08;;F16M11/2035;;F16M13/027;;Y10S248/918;;A47B21/0314;;F16M11/2035;;A47B2210/15;;F16M11/08;;A47B2021/0342;;A47B2021/0321;;F16M13/027;;A47B2200/009;;A47B2021/0335;;Y10S248/918,A47B21/03;;F16M11/12,248/278.1;;248/918;;248/160;;403/166,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Affinity exists when a client's requests are all routed to the same server. This is often the case, for example, during secure online transactions. A problem occurs when the preferred server becomes temporarily unavailable, and the client's requests are directed to a different server. When the original server is restored, it must detect the fact that its affinity with the client was disrupted, and any client-specific data in its cache may be invalid. In an exemplary embodiment of the system and method disclosed herein, an “affinity command” is exchanged between the client and the server during each client request. The affinity command contains a user ID associated with the client and a “generation ID”, which is unique for each request. When a request is received from a client, the server examines the generation ID in the accompanying affinity command and compares it to its internally recorded value. If they match, the server knows it has not missed any requests. In this case, the server updates the generation ID and sends the new value back to the client, along with the requested cache entry. If the generation ID received from the client fails to match the recorded value, an affinity break is detected, and the server updates its cache from the database.",IBM,COPELAND GEORGE P;;CONNER MICHAEL H;;FLURRY GREGORY A,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (2000-12-13),https://lens.org/142-880-500-557-161,Granted Patent,yes,35,4,2,2,0,H04L67/14;;H04L69/329;;H04L67/561;;H04L67/564;;H04L67/568;;H04L69/329;;H04L67/14;;H04L67/561;;H04L9/40;;H04L67/564;;H04L67/568,G06F15/16;;H04L29/06;;H04L29/08,709/228;;709/227;;709/219;;709/230;;709/238,4,1,124-104-406-484-571,10.1109/icpads.1998.741126,"Copeland et al., ""Web Caching with Dynamic Content,"" May 2000, pp. 1-35.;;""Oracle9i Application Server Web Caching,"" Oct. 2000, pp. 1-7.;;""Caching Live Business Content,"" © 2000 Persistence Software, Inc., pp. 1-11.;;Pean et al., ""Effective Mechanisms to Reduce the Overhead of Migratory Sharing for Linked-Based Cache Coherence Protocols in Clustering Multiprocessor Architecture,"" © 1998 IEEE, pp. 511-518.",INACTIVE

    A system and method are disclosed, according to which, the responsiveness of client/server-based distributed web applications operating in an object-oriented environment may be improved by cofetching read only commands. In an exemplary embodiment, the system and method are implemented by defining special preExecute and postExecute methods of cacheable commands. The preExecute method of a requested command may be invoked to execute secondary commands and then return them to the requesting client. The postExecute method of a requested command may be invoked to place the returned commands in a cache, along with the requested command. In this manner, a single request can be used to execute, retrieve and cache multiple related commands. Cofetched commands are designated by the application developer when the requested command and its associated methods are created, and may be chosen based on their anticipated use in conjunction with the requested command. For example, a log-on command may cofetch other user authentication commands, since they are generally required immediately after the user logs on. Cofetching avoids the need to issue a separate request for every command.

    A system and method are disclosed, according to which, the responsiveness of client/server-based distributed web applications operating in an object-oriented environment may be improved by coordinating execution of cacheable entries among a group of web servers, operably coupled in a network. In an exemplary embodiment, entries are considered to be either commands or Java Server Pages (JSPs), and the system and method are implemented by defining a class of objects (i.e., CacheUnits) to manage the caching of entries. An entry must be executed before it can be stored in a cache. Since this is computationally costly, each cacheable entry has an associated coordinating CacheUnit, which sees to it that only one CacheUnit executes an entry. Once the entry has been executed, a copy of it resides in the cache of the coordinating CacheUnit, from which it can be accessed by other CacheUnits without having to re-execute it.

   A system and method are disclosed, according to which, the responsiveness of client/server-based distributed web applications operating in an object-oriented environment may be improved by batching invalidations of cache entries. Cache invalidations require updates of invalid cache entries from the database. Since database accesses are time-consuming, it is advantageous to combine several invalidations and execute them all at once (i.e.to batch them). In an exemplary embodiment, cache entries may be identified or located on the basis of a unique ID. A list of IDs can be compiled by an application and consulted by a batch invalidation daemon, which uses the IDs therein to invalidate the desired entries. Alternatively, a time limit property of each cache entry can be examined by a time limit invalidation daemon, to invalidate entries that have timed out. Batching invalidations implies that invalid entries may remain in cache until the daemon wakes up. However, moderate latency in updating cached data is typically acceptable in e-business applications.

The main body of a JSP may contain calls to several other JSPs. The conventional method of caching such a composite JSP places a fully expanded version of each called JSP at the point in the main code from which it is called. This can result in considerable redundancy, since the same JSP may be called from several places. In an exemplary embodiment of the techniques disclosed herein for caching composite JSPs, the called JSPs are stored separately from the main JSP, along with links allowing the called JSPs to be located in the cache or executed. This eliminates redundancy, since only one copy of each called JSP is required.

   A system and method are disclosed, according to which, the responsiveness of client/server-based distributed web applications operating in an object-oriented environment may be improved by detecting and handling affinity breaks between a client and server. Affinity exists when a client's requests are all routed to the same server. This is often the case, for example, during secure online transactions. A problem occurs when the preferred server becomes temporarily unavailable, and the client's requests are directed to a different server. When the original server is restored, it must detect the fact that its affinity with the client was disrupted, and any client-specific data in its cache may be invalid. In an exemplary embodiment of the system and method disclosed herein, an affinity command is exchanged between the client and the server during each client request. The affinity command contains a user ID associated with the client and a generation ID, which is unique for each request. When a request is received from a client, the server examines the generation ID in the accompanying affinity command and compares it to its internally recorded value. If they match, the server knows it has not missed any requests. In this case, the server updates the generation ID and sends the new value back to the client, along with the requested cache entry. If the generation ID received from the client fails to match the recorded value, an affinity break is detected, and the server updates its cache from the database.

   A system and method are disclosed, according to which, the responsiveness of client/server-based distributed web applications operating in an object-oriented environment may be improved by coordinating execution of cacheable entries among a group of web servers, operably coupled in a network. In an exemplary embodiment, entries are considered to be either commands or Java Server Pages (JSPs), and the system and method are implemented by defining a class of objects (i.e., CacheUnits) to manage the caching of entries. An entry must be executed before it can be stored in a cache. Since this is computationally costly, each cacheable entry has an associated coordinating CacheUnit, which sees to it that only one CacheUnit executes an entry. Once the entry has been executed, a copy of it resides in the cache of the coordinating CacheUnit, from which it can be accessed by other CacheUnits without having to re-execute it.

   A system and method are disclosed, according to which, the responsiveness of client/server-based distributed web applications operating in an object-oriented environment may be improved by cofetching read only commands. In an exemplary embodiment, the system and method are implemented by defining special preExecute and postExecute methods of cacheable commands. The preExecute method of a requested command may be invoked to execute secondary commands and then return them to the requesting client. The postExecute method of a requested command may be invoked to place the returned commands in a cache, along with the requested command. In this manner, a single request can be used to execute, retrieve and cache multiple related commands. Cofetched commands are designated by the application developer when the requested command and its associated methods are created, and may be chosen based on their anticipated use in conjunction with the requested command. For example, a log-on command may cofetch other user authentication commands, since they are generally required immediately after the user logs on. Cofetching avoids the need to issue a separate request for every command.

    A digital data processing system comprises at least one subsystem comprising a plurality of resources, such as a storage subsystem comprising a plurality of drive modules, and a host processor. The host processor is connected to the drive modules through an interconnection which has a topology in the form of a loop. The interconnection has at least one configuration switch that is selectively configurable to a pass-through mode, in which the topology comprises the entire loop, or a bypass mode, in which the topology comprises a portion of the loop including the host processor and, possibly, at least one of the drive modules in the storage subsystem. The host processor can selectively condition the configuration switch into the pass-through mode or said bypass mode to connect more or fewer drive modules into the loop. Each of the disk modules further includes a disk module and a port by-pass switch, the port by-pass switch also being selectively configurable to a pass-through mode, in which the topology of the interconnection includes the disk module, and a bypass mode, in which the topology of the interconnection bypasses the disk module. The host processor can selectively condition the port bypass switches of the disk modules to connect more or fewer disk modules into the loop. The configuration switch and the port by-pass switches are directly controlled by a subsystem controller, which receives commands for controlling the switches from the host processor over a separate command interconnection.
