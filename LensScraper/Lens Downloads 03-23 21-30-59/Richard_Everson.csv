A removable ring 9 stands on the base of the chamber. Fixed to the top of the ring is a perforated disc 8 on which tea or coffee is placed. The base is pierced by a central hole provided with a bush 10 having a conical bore, which receives, detachably, a corresponding conical part 11 secured to the upper end of a tube 12 supporting the infusion chamber. The mouth of the chamber is provided with an inturned peripheral flange 3 forming a seat for a resilient gasket 4. A disc of filter paper, 4a, is supported between the gasket and the lid 5, which is kept in position by a bowed strap 6 of spring steel engaging hooked lugs 7 secured to the outside of the chamber. Boiling water is fed into the chamber through the tube 12 and the brewed beverage passes through the filter-disc 4a and the lid 5 into a container 13 provided with a draw-off pipe 14. The mouth of the container receives a detachable shroud 15 provided with a lid 16. The container is located in a casing 17 filled with heat-insulating material.

   A method of forming a polymer layer on a support surface by the use of a coating agent and polymerizable compounds. The coating agent provides photoreactive groups adapted to attach the agent to the surface, as well as photoreactive groups adapted to remain unattached to the surface, and thus serve as photoinitiators for the activation of polymerizable compounds in order to form a polymer layer thereon. Also provided are coating agents, per se, as well as a method of using such agents and the resultant surfaces and devices fabricated therefrom.
