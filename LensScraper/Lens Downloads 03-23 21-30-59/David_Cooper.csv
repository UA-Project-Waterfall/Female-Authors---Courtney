The crewmember releasing the brakes does so by merely adjusting the air pressure in the train's air brake line to a predetermined level. The brake release system's valves open at this pressure allowing the system to be pressurized. This pressure provides the force needed to release the brakes when the pressure in the train's air brake line is released. The system then resets itself and is ready for its next use. This system can be installed on a rail car without interfering with the conventional method of releasing the brakes.","COOPER; DAVID;;COOPER, DECEASED; CHARLES",COOPER DAVID;;COOPER CHARLES,,https://lens.org/107-771-967-034-100,Granted Patent,yes,10,3,1,1,0,B60T13/406;;B60T15/54;;B61H13/02;;B61H13/02;;B60T13/406;;B60T15/54,B60T13/40;;B60T15/54;;B61H13/02,303/68;;308/70;;308/86,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Inlet tank 5 is sectioned into an inlet chamber 20 and filling chambers 21 and (22-24). Filling chamber 21 has a connector duct 25 which is articulated 33 about one end and has a float 29 proximate the free end. In its first horizontal position duct 25 allows waste-water to flow from chamber 20 through inlet conduit 6 to reed-bed 1. Filling the reed bed causes the duct to lift (via float 29) to its second elevated position where it is retained on wheel 50 via peg 45a. In this position, further water flow through the duct is prevented. Wheel 50 is continuously rotating and will retain peg 45a for ² of a revolution. During this time, reed-bed 1 is allowed to drain. For the final revolution, peg 45a is released, allowing the duct to drop back to its horizontal position and cause the reed-bed to refill. A similar mechanism is present for filling chambers (22-24), all of which use a common wheel and are therefore filled and emptied cyclically.

Photo-electric turbidometers. BRITISH TRANSPORT DOCKS BOARD. April 23, 1964 [April 26,1963], No. 16573/63. Heading G1A. [Also in Division A4] A submersible device for measuring the solid material in suspension in the liquid in which it is placed is designed to be left in position for a considerable period. A silt meter for a river or harbour is described in which light from a source in the device is directed across a gap filled with the liquid to a photo-cell so that the transmissivity of the liquid can be determined. Both source and photo-cell must be separated from the cell by windows and these tend to become coated with material deposited from the liquid. According to the invention the device is provided with a window-cleaning element which can be operated by a remote control to clean the windows whilst the device remains submerged. In Fig. 1 the windows are shown at 5 and 6, liquid being allowed to flow between them through apertures 7 and 8. The window-cleaning element consists of a plastic sponge 14 clamped between plates 16 and 17 on rod 15 mounted on a plunger 12 slidable within the body 1 of the device. The body 1 is suspended by a flexible hose 9 through which water may be pumped to cause the plunger and attached sponge to move downwards. Passage of the sponge over the windows can be detected from the photo-cell output and when the plunger reaches the lowest position apertures 27 and 28, past which the clean pumped water flows, lie opposite the source and cell windows so that a zero check can be made. A spring 20 returns the plunger to its normal position when the clean water pressure is reduced. A non-return valve 18 is provided in the bottom of the plunger and sample liquid can be drawn through this and inlet ports 22 up the hose 9. Thus calibration of the device can be done by analyzing samples so withdrawn and comparing the result with the photo-cell current at the time of withdrawal.",BRITISH TRANSP DOCKS BOARD,COOPER DAVID HENRY,,https://lens.org/014-307-024-215-677,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,G01N21/15,G01N21/15,A4F FAQ           FAQ;;A4F F24C          -;;A4F F52           FAQ;;G1A AFF           FF;;G1A AR7           4;;G1A A247          4;;G1A A248          4;;G1A A269          4;;G1A A307          4;;G1A A357          4;;G1A A358          4;;G1A A369          4;;G1A A402          4;;G1A A404          4;;G1A A406          4;;G1A A42Y          4;;G1A A43Y          4;;G1A A447          4;;G1A A448          4;;G1A A457          4;;G1A A458          4;;G1A A46Y          4;;G1A A463          4;;G1A A465          4;;G1A A467          4;;G1A A478          4;;G1A A482          4;;G1A A610          4;;G1A A750          4;;G1A A761          4;;G1A A763          4,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Once the final evacuation pressure is reached, a pump-out port or tube of the VIG assembly is sealed forming a VIG unit while the VIG assembly is still in the vacuum chamber. After sealing, chamber pressures are gradually increased to atmospheric while the gap between the substrates of the VIG unit remains at a pressure less than atmospheric which is close to the final evacuation pressure.",GUARDIAN INDUSTRIES,COOPER DAVID J,GUARDIAN INDUSTRIES CORP (2008-03-19);;GUARDIAN GLASS LLC (2017-08-01),https://lens.org/150-661-222-306-118,Patent Application,yes,18,40,8,8,0,E06B3/6612;;E06B3/6612;;E06B3/6736;;E06B3/6736;;E06B3/67365;;E06B3/67365;;E06B3/67369;;E06B3/67369;;E06B3/6775;;E06B3/6775;;Y02A30/249;;Y02A30/249;;Y02B80/22;;Y02B80/22,C03C27/06,156/104;;156/382,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

These objects are then queued in priority order and requests for each object's data sent to the server at a rate determined by the available network bandwidth. The importance of each object is recalculated per scene update and new requests are sent out based on these values. Only data requests that can be responded to within the next update cycle are sent, while most request messages are retained. This allows for immediate response to a changing view position, and reduces visual latency, defined as the time that lapses until an object having a data deficit gets that data. Latency is reduced for important objects at the cost of lesser objects. Because important objects are those which contribute most to the visual scene, the overall richness of the scene appears to grow faster than the number of objects received.",ADAPTIVE MEDIA TECHNOLOGIES,COOPER DAVID G,ASSENTIVE SOULUTIONS INC (2001-05-15);;ORACLE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION (2003-10-28);;ADAPTIVE MEDIA TECHNOLOGIES (1998-03-27);;ORACLE CORPORATION (2001-10-15);;ASSENTIVE SOLUTIONS INC (2001-10-15),https://lens.org/167-903-247-530-809,Granted Patent,yes,2,123,1,1,0,G06T15/40;;G06T15/40,G06T15/40,345/433,6,4,105-096-365-962-517;;112-046-305-942-109;;059-785-411-644-278;;011-164-233-654-41X,10.1145/166117.166149;;10.1145/91394.91416;;10.1145/319120.319122;;10.1145/147156.147158,"Arikawa, M. et al., Dynamic LoD for QoS Management in the Next Generation VRML, Proceedings of the Intl.

Once the final evacuation pressure is reached, a pump-out port or tube of the VIG assembly is sealed forming a VIG unit while the VIG assembly is still in the vacuum chamber. After sealing, chamber pressures are gradually increased to atmospheric while the gap between the substrates of the VIG unit remains at a pressure less than atmospheric which is close to the final evacuation pressure.",GUARDIAN INDUSTRIES,COOPER DAVID J,GUARDIAN GLASS LLC (2017-08-01),https://lens.org/043-441-482-312-385,Patent Application,yes,0,9,8,8,0,E06B3/6612;;E06B3/6612;;E06B3/6736;;E06B3/6736;;E06B3/67365;;E06B3/67365;;E06B3/67369;;E06B3/67369;;E06B3/6775;;E06B3/6775;;Y02A30/249;;Y02A30/249;;Y02B80/22;;Y02B80/22,E06B3/66,65/34,1,0,,,Machine translation of CN1676481(A) retrieved 03Feb2015.,ACTIVE

SOLUTION: A high-frequency and high-accuracy main oscillator 20 is frequency-divided by a divider 21 and is supplied to the main clock of a high- accuracy counter 22. During the initialization of a system, a CPU 12 reads a count value from the counter 22 at a proper point of a GSM period to prepare for the succeeding, first pause period. The number of pulses from the divider 21 is counted during approximately 0.5-1 second being synchronized by a sub clock from a low-frequency and low-cost sub oscillator 25, the sub clock is calibrated by a main clock, and the frequency ratio of the main oscillator 20 to the sub oscillator 25 is obtained. During operation, counters 27 and 28 alternately perform loading and measurement by the sub clock.

    A method and apparatus for using a neural network to process information includes multiple nodes arrayed in multiple layers for transforming input arrays from prior layers or the environment into output arrays for subsequent layers or output devices. Learning rules based on reinforcement are applied. Interconnections between nodes are provided in a manner whereby the number and structure of the interconnections are self-adjusted by the learning rules during learning. At least one of the layers is used as a processing layer, and multiple lateral inputs to each node of each processing layer are used to retrieve information. The invention provides rapid, unsupervised processing of complex data sets, such as imagery or continuous human speech, and captures successful processing or pattern classification constellations for implementation in other networks. The invention includes application-specific self-adjusting multi-layer architectures that employ reinforcement learning rules to create updated data arrays for computation.

SOLUTION: At a base station, the transmitting signal, that is generated at a signal synthesizing part 16, is synthesized with the signal that is produced by delaying the transmitting signal by a delay circuit 18 by a period longer than the delayed diffusion which is estimated in a system. Then the synthetic signal is transmitted. A mobile station has a means which reproduces the original signal from the synthetic signal. Meanwhile, the delayed signal is attenuated at the base station, before the signal is synthesized with its original non-delayed signal. Since the coherence band width can be reduced by setting a delayed variable, the frequency selectivity fading win not affect the entire band width of a signal channel in the similarly. As a result, the decoding is attained on all channels with higher accuracy, despite the occurrence of the multi-path disturbances.",NEC CORP,COOPER DAVID E,,https://lens.org/065-063-366-310-49X,Patent Application,no,0,0,7,7,0,H04B1/711;;H04B1/712;;H04L1/08;;H04B1/711;;H04L1/08;;H04B1/712,H04B1/707;;H04B7/02;;H04B7/26;;H04L1/02;;H04L1/08,,0,0,,,,PENDING

More particularly, certain example embodiments relate to techniques for providing localized heating to edge seals of units, and/or unitized ovens for accomplishing the same. In certain example embodiments, a unit is pre-heated to one or more intermediate temperatures, localized heating (e.g., from one or more substantially linear focused IR heat sources) is provided proximate to the peripheral edges of the unit so as to melt frits placed thereon, and cooled. In certain non-limiting implementations, the preheating and/or cooling may be provided in one or more steps. An oven for accomplishing the same may include multiple zones for performing the above-noted steps, each zone optionally including one or more chambers. Accordingly, in certain example embodiments, a temperature gradient proximate to the edges of the unit is created, thereby reducing the chances of breakage and/or at least some de-tempering of the substrates.

    A semantic attractor memory uses an evolving neural network architecture and learning rules derived from the study of human language acquisition and change to store, process and retrieve information. The architecture is based on multiple layer channels, with random connections from one layer to the next. One or more layers are devoted to processing input information. At least one processing layer is provided. One or more layers are devoted to processing outputs and feedback is provided from the outputs back to the processing layer or layers. Inputs from parallel channels are also provided to the one or more processing layers. With the exception of the feedback loop and central processing layers, the network is feedforward unless it is employed in a hybrid back-propagation configuration. The learning rules are based on non-stationary statistical processes, such as the Polya process or the processes leading to Bose-Einstein statistics, again derived from considerations of human language acquisition. The invention provides rapid, unsupervised processing of complex data sets, such as imagery or continuous human speech, and a means to capture successful processing or pattern classification constellations for implementation in other networks.

   Fractal computers are neural network architectures that exploit the characteristics of fractal attractors to perform general computation. This disclosure explains neural network implementations for each of the critical components of computation: composition, minimalization, and recursion. It then describes the creation of fractal attractors within these implementations by means of selective amplification or inhibition of input signals, and it describes how to estimate critical parameters for each implementation by using results from studies of fractal percolation. These implementation provide standardizable implicit alternatives to traditional neural network designs. Consequently, fractal computers permit the exploitation of alternative technologies for computation based on dynamic systems with underlying fractal attractors.

The defined filter component has resonant mode(s), each having a mode frequency which can be tuned to a corresponding target mode frequency via physical adjustment of parameter(s) of the filter component. A tuning equation is formed by linearly relating, via a slope matrix, changes in the mode frequencies to corresponding physical adjustment in the parameter(s), and by using an inverse of the slope matrix as part of the tuning equation. A tuning procedure is performed for a filter component to be tuned, comprising: determining, using the tuning equation, adjustment information for parameter(s) of the filter component to adjust measured mode frequency(ies) of the filter component toward meeting corresponding target mode frequency(ies) for the resonant mode(s) within corresponding tolerance(s); and outputting the determined adjustment information for physical adjustment of the parameter(s).

    Various methods of inspecting a workpiece for residue are provided. In one aspect, a test structure is provided that includes a substrate, a first conductor on the substrate and a second conductor on the substrate. A resistor network is coupled in parallel between the first conductor and the second conductor. The resistor network has n resistors and n contacts and a measurable resistance R _{ M } . Each of the n resistors has a known resistance R _{ k } and a known position on the substrate. Each of the n contacts is connected between one of the n resistors and the first conductor or the second conductor, whereby the location of any of the n contacts in an open state is determined from the equation:  R  M  =  1  1  R  k  +  1  R  n 

    The test structure provides for not only the identity but also the location of open contacts.

The double modulation produces a number of sidebands, and the two modulation frequencies are related to one another such that a selection of sidebands falls into two groups of closely spaced component sidebands. One group is disposed in frequency at the spectral feature of interest and serves to probe the spectral feature. The other group is disposed in frequency remote from the feature and serves as a reference group. Within each group the component sidebands are offset from one another by a characteristic offset frequency, which can be considerably less than the width of the spectral feature under investigation.

Ltd. Sept. 2, 1958 [Sept. 24, 1957], No. 29912/57. Class 144 (2). A pneumatic tyre tread reinforcement is built up from separate parallelogramshaped strips of parallel cord fabric which are interleaved into endless band form so that one portion of each strip overlies a portion of an adjacent strip and another portion of said each strip underlies a portion of another adjacent strip. The strips may be half-lapped as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, with the cords of adjacent parallel-cord strips being in oppositely crossed relation and the dimensions of the strips being such that the lapped portions are either triangular-shaped, Fig. 1, or trapezoidal-shaped, Fig. 2. Alternatively, the strips may be two-thirds or threequarters lapped to give a three or four tier structure (Figs. 5 and 6) with a portion of each strip in each tier. As shown in Fig. 7, adjacent strips may have cords angles of the same sense but different magnitude. Fig. 8 shows a further form of ""braid""-like structure wherein each strip (a2) has its centre portion overlying or underlying the centre portion of the central one (b2) of the adjacent strips b1, b2, b3 and its end portions underlying or overlying an end portion of each of the two outer (b1, b3) of the three adjacent strips. In all cases the strip may comprise steel cords, with a preferred cord angle of 18 degrees and the reinforcement may be combined with a conventional breaker strip of parallel steel cords having a cord angle of 90 degrees.

Ltd. Sept. 5, 1957 [Sept. 15, 1956], No. 28275/56. Class 144 (2). A pneumatic tyre is reinforced in the tread region by a layer 1 of a flexible synthetic organic polymeric material of high molecular weight and having a modulus of elasticity in at least one direction in the plane of the layer in the range 100,000 to 2,000,000 lbs. per sq. inch and a modulus of rigidity in the range of 30,000 to 700,000 lbs. per sq. inch, the layer 1 being thicker at each side portion 2 than at its central portion 3 and being embedded in the tread to extend wholly around the circumference and across the width thereof. The layer 1 may be of nylon or "" Terylene "" (Registered Trade Mark) and may be used in conjunction with a layer or layers of steel cord fabric. The thickened side portions 2 of the layer may be additionally reinforced by a circumferential winding of textile or steel cord, and each may extend laterally from 2 to 15% of the total width of the layer. The layer may be formed as a band, or extruded as a strip which is lap jointed to form a band. Alternatively the layer may be drawn in either one direction, or in two directions at an angle of from 15 to 90 degrees to each other, the layer being laid with a direction of drawing extending circumferentially of the tread. Alternatively where the layer is dual drawn, or two layers are used, the respective drawing directions may be disposed symmetrically with respect to the circumferential direction. The carcase with which the tread reinforcement is used may comprise textile or steel cord plies disposed with their cords at 90 degrees to the circumferential direction, and the or each layer 1, which may be perforated to key with the embedding rubber of the tyre, may be disposed above, below or between the carcase plies.",DUNLOP RUBBER CO,COOPER DAVID HENRY D OYLY,,https://lens.org/092-982-338-737-118,Granted Patent,no,0,1,2,2,0,B60C9/18;;B60C9/20,B60C9/18;;B60C9/20,B7C CRC           CRC;;B7C C3B17         CRC;;B7C C3B2          CRC;;B7C C3B7          CRC,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Air cushion vehicles. DUNLOP RUBBER CO. Ltd. Jan. 9, 1963 [Jan. 29, 1962], No. 3242/62. Heading B7K. A skirt for attachment to an air cushion vehicle has a plurality of folds, the ridges of which lie substantially parallel to one another, and a plurality of fold-supporting members, said members being laminer in form and of flexible and resilient material, each member being attached to the skirt, extending in a direction parallel to the direction of the ridges of the folds thereof, and being disposed in a plane that is directed in an outboard direction of the skirt, each member being of small thickness relative to its width so that in the assembled and operational state of the skirt on the air cushion vehicle when a deflecting force is applied to the lower portion of the skirt to deflect it inwardly, the lower portion of the member will be twisted relative to the upper portion of the member. An air cushion vehicle 12 has attached thereto at its lower periphery an angle-section moulded rubber member 8 secured by a metal member 13 and bolts 14, the member 8 being slotted on its under-surface to receive the upper ends of reinforcing strips 5 which are bonded to both the member 8 and the planar faces 3 of a corrugated flexible skirt 1 which forms a peripheral extension of the wall of a plenum chamber enclosing the air cushion. It is stated that when encountering an obstacle the lower ends of strips 5 are caused to twist and present their flat surfaces to the obstacle so that the skirt may deflect readily. Other sections for the skirt are described. In one, the ridge portions 4 are separate and bonded to flat connecting portions and in others the reinforcing members are attached at the ridges and lie substantially normal to the general plane of the skirt.",DUNLOP RUBBER CO,COOPER DAVID HENRY D OYLY,,https://lens.org/027-190-686-683-336,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,B60V1/16,B60V1/16,B7K KDC           KDC,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

An anti-breakage device for a skip in a skip hoist comprises a flexible sheet 1 normally supported by one or more inflatable members 2 to extend across the skip in the manner of an anti-breakage plate. The sheet 1 is preferably of abrasion resisting rubber reinforced with fabric and is vulcanized to the inflatable members 2 which are of substantially conical shape, but with flat surfaces engaging the sheet 1. Each inflatable member 2 has an inner rubber lining 8 encircled by a layer of rubberized fabric which is reinforced by bands of rubberized steel cord fabric 10. The fabric 9 may be substantially weftless with the warp arranged so that, as the device is deflected, the sheet 1 is uncreased. Separate inlet and outlet conduits 14 to the interiors of the inflatable members 2 may be provided with non-return valves and with adjustable constrictions so that the rate of deflection and return of the device may be varied. The member 5 carrying the device may be a structural member of the skip, or a separate member for attachment to the skip.",DUNLOP RUBBER CO,COOPER DAVID HENRY D OYLEY,,https://lens.org/057-900-649-538-502,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The defined filter component has resonant mode(s), each having a mode frequency which can be tuned to a corresponding target mode frequency via physical adjustment of parameter(s) of the filter component. A tuning equation is formed by linearly relating, via a slope matrix, changes in the mode frequencies to corresponding physical adjustment in the parameter(s), and by using an inverse of the slope matrix as part of the tuning equation. A tuning procedure is performed for a filter component to be tuned, comprising: determining, using the tuning equation, adjustment information for parameter(s) of the filter component to adjust measured mode frequency(ies) of the filter component toward meeting corresponding target mode frequency(ies) for the resonant mode(s) within corresponding tolerance(s); and outputting the determined adjustment information for physical adjustment of the parameter(s).",NOKIA SOLUTIONS & NETWORKS OY,COOPER STEVEN J;;HENDRY DAVID R,MESAPLEXX PTY LTD (2016-07-13);;NOKIA SOLUTIONS AND NETWORKS OY (2016-10-05),https://lens.org/026-913-779-972-241,Patent Application,yes,0,0,7,7,0,H01P1/20;;G06F30/20;;H01P1/2086;;H01P7/06;;H01P7/105;;Y10T29/49016;;H01P11/008;;H03H3/013;;Y10T29/49016;;H01P1/2086;;H01P7/06;;H01P7/105;;H04B7/0456;;H04L7/0276;;H04L43/028;;G01R23/07;;H03H3/00,H04L12/26;;H04B7/04;;H04L7/027,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

An active noise control arrangement includes a first loudspeaker disposed within a passenger compartment of the vehicle. A digital signal processor receives audio data and transmits an audio signal to the first loudspeaker dependent upon the audio data. A microphone is disposed within the passenger compartment and converts the sound from the first loudspeaker and the noise within the passenger compartment into a microphone signal. The microphone signal is transmitted to the digital signal processor, and the digital signal processor modifies the audio signal such that the audio signal attenuates the noise in the passenger compartment.
