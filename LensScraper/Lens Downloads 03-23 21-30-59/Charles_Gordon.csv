   A method and apparatus for the comparison of two code listings. The process allows for comparing of multiple lines of code in a code listing when determining whether the code from a first code listing matches the code in a second code listing to determine lines that have been deleted or inserted. The first code listing is referred to as the old code listing and the second code listing is referred to as the new code listing. The process performs a series of comparisons instead of single comparison when looking for a match. The result is a more accurate set of comparison results than with a single comparison.

STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES Ltd. June 13, 1958 [June 20, 1957], No. 19507/57. Class 37. In a current or voltage - sensitive bridge network, a non-linear resistor 7 is connected in series with a second resistor 10 to one input terminal C, and constitutes one arm, of the bridge; and an amplifier 12, 13, having a differential output connected across the second resistor, has two inputs with respect to a common terminal which are connected to the respective output terminals A, B of the bridge, the common terminal being connected to the other input terminal 20 of the bridge. The base electrodes of transistors 12, 13 are connected to bridge vertices A, B ; the emitter electrodes are commonly connected to the positive side of the bridge input over resistor 11; and the collector electrodes are connected through coils 14, 15 across resistor 10 which is in series with a thermistor 7. The arm AC contains a temperature compensating network constituted by a thermistor 22 shunted by resistor 23. The bridge is initially balanced by adjusting rheostats 6 and 24. Any subsequent fluctuation of the D.C. supply voltage S will produce unequal currents in coils 14, 15 due to unequal bias voltages at A and B ; the coils may be part of a controlling device to maintain S at a given value ; alternatively they may constitute the differential coils of an ammeter. In another embodiment, Fig. 3 (not shown), the transistor collector currents may be amplified by a further pair of transistors; the coils 14, 15 being connected to the collectors of these latter transistors. A capacitor may be shunted across resistor 10 to improve the response of the circuit.",STANDARD TELEPHONES CABLES LTD,BENNETT GORDON CHARLES,,https://lens.org/032-970-352-152-293,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,G01R17/105,G01R17/10,G1U UBV1X         UBV1X;;G1U U5A2          CC;;G1U U5B2          CC;;G1U U5C4          CC;;G1U U5C5          CC;;G1U U5M10         CC;;G1U U5M11B        CC;;G1U U5M20         CC,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   An apparatus and method is disclosed for processing of multiple sources of data in a single execution process to synchronize the data to be analyzed by multiple analysis routines. A control program is given the criteria for each of the analysis routines and then reads data from each source meeting the criteria, converting the data from each source to a common format, controlling the analysis routines for each source for time synchronization of the data from the multiple sources and executing each analysis routine in time order. Specifically the following subroutines are used: (1) a routine to read and process a set of controls to describe data by time and type for each analysis routine; (2) a routine to read and process a set of controls to describe the sources of input; (3) a routine for reading data from each of the sources of input a record at a time, deciding whether the time and type for the record is requested for the current analysis, and if not, reading another record or, if so, setting up to process and return the current time and type of record for the source in a common format; and (4) a routine to decide which time from the current record for each source is the earliest and then execute the appropriate analysis by type of data requested for that source record by calling the appropriate analysis routine.

Thermistor ThB reduces the effect of ambient temperature on the bridge. The transducer may respond to the drip of a liquid, and the meter then displays the rate of drip. A modified circuit, Fig. 2 (not shown), uses a slightly different mono-stable circuit with the heater of the compensating thyristor forming the common emitter load of the two transistors and with the base of the second transistor decoupled by a capacitor (C3) to reduce sensitivity to interference.

In a lever-operated ratchet device, such as a multi-stroke handbrake control, a cable drum is formed with a ratchet wheel 7 on one side and a dished disc 8 on the other, the inner peripheral portion of the wheel 7 being machined to form a shoulder 23 preventing snagging of the teeth by the cable. Escape of the cable from the drum is prevented by a bolt 15 mounted between side plates 3, 4 and lying closely adjacent the edge of disc 8. The operating hand lever 18 carries a driving pawl 19, and a holding pawl 12 is pivoted on bolt 15, the pawls being withdrawn from the wheel 7 to free the cable 13 by depressing a release button 22 to move a member 20 clear of a stop pin 21 and then rotating lever 18 clockwise to bring the pawls into contact and thus cause them to rotate clear of the wheel 7.

The servo-control signal modulates the melt heater power which adjusts the temperature isotherms of the melt in order to maintain the crystal cross-sectional area constant. It has been found that a thermal delay which occurs when heat is conducted from the melt crucible to the crystal/melt interface can cause the crystal cross-sectional area to depart from its uniform expected value.

[Also in Divisions B6, B8 and G5] In Fig. 1, one end of a section of polythene tube is heat sealed at 5, and into the open end 3 is inserted a carboard blank of which one end 9 is folded back on the main portion 12 to receive the content of the pack. The protruding part 4 of the blank has a C-shaped cut-out, and is folded to lie outside the tube and to form an aperture 14 in the shape of a U with one arm foreshortened. The entry to the U may be flared, to facilitate passing the U over a rail from which the pack is to be suspended, the rail then seating in the short arm of the U, which extends along the vertical centre line of the pack. The blank is secured to the tube, and the tube is closed, by staples 15. Fig. 4 shows a carton provided with similar suspension means, constructed from a blank of cardboard or similar flexible material shown in Fig. 5. The blank is adapted to fold, as by scoring, along the broken lines, so that the part 30 becomes the back, 32 the bottom, 29 the front, with a window 53 covered by transparent material, and 31 the top. Part 24 is secured to part 22, which is folded to form the aperture 51. The sides are closed by flaps 47, 49 shown in Fig. 4, and a side panel 35, an extension 39 of which is folded to lie in contact with the inner face of the front 29. A tongue 41 is then folded to lie along the outer face of panel 35, and its rounded free end 43 is passed through a slot 45 at the juncture between panel 35 and the back 30, to lie inside the pack and keep the side closed. The other side of the pack is similarly closed. In Fig. 6, the pack is formed by folding a long blank about a transverse line, and securing the sides by staples to form an envelope 57. One end of the blank is concave as at 56, and the other end is folded upon and glued or stapled to itself to form the aperture 58 and to leave free a closure flap 54 having a tongue 55 which may be inserted through slits 59, 60.

   A method for reducing the processing time required to compute the expansion of a determinant. The invention systematically examines the determinant for elements that are zero. By systematically determining which elements in the determinant are equal to zero, the invention can determine which terms in the determinant expansion will be zero. The invention can then eliminate these terms from the calculations required to compute the expansion of the determinant. In other words, the invention does not calculate all of the terms of the expanded determinate. Instead, the invention only calculates the terms of the expansion which contain all non-zero terms. By utilizing this methodology, significant processing time is saved because the computer does not perform those calculations which will eventually equal zero.

Stand-by systems. STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES, Ltd. June 10, 1955 [March 10, 1954], No. 6970/54. Class 38 (4). Stand-by equipment used in conjunction with an alternating-current supply comprises an inverter and means for stabilizing the load thereon comprising a circuit arrangement for rectifying and feeding back to the direct-current input circuit of the inverter alternating-current power surplus to the instantaneous requirements of the load circuit. A change-over switch is adapted to detect a failure of the normal alternating-current supply and effects a rapid change-over to the stand-by equipment whilst isolating the normal supply to the load. The inverter may be held ready for operation but isolated from the main supply until it is triggered into full operation upon detection of a failure; alternatively, the inverter normally floats in idling condition across the normal supply and load. In another arrangement, the inverter supplies the load at all times, means being provided for rectifying a normal source of alternating-current and feeding the rectified power to the inverter in parallel with a directcurrent source therefor, the change-over switch detecting a failure of the normal source and connecting the alternative source in circuit. As shown, the stand-by supply is derived from battery SB by means of an inverter comprising discharge valves V1, V2, and transformer TR3. A bridge rectifier MR2 with a choke output filter L2 feeding the battery, and supplied from an auxiliary winding on the inverter output transformer TR3, is so arranged that, with the inverter providing slightly more than full-load current, the rectifier is just conductive. With loads less than full load, the output voltage increases until it is limited by means of the rectifier circuit. The load on the inverter is thus maintained substantially constant and the output voltage varies between narrow limits. The inverter is normally held quiescent by negative bias applied in series with the alternating voltage to the grids of the valves V1, V2. During normal operation, the alternating voltage at terminals N1, L1, is compared with a voltage derived from a synchronous motorgenerator set MG, so arranged that at the normal supply voltage the output from a comparison circuit is substantially zero. The comparison circuit comprises transformers TR1, TR2, and rectifier MR1, current-limiting elements R1, LN1, being provided. The motor-generator also supplies the alternating voltage to the grids of the valves V1, V2. On mains failure, the output voltage of the comparison circuit increases rapidly and is applied to the grid of a cold cathode tube V4 which discharges capacitor C6 through a coil of change-over contactor CO, and also triggers a thyratron V3 which removes the disabling bias from the inverter valves, so starting the inverter. After the inverter has been put on load, the motor-generator is switched from the mains to the inverter output and continues to operate. On restoration of the main supply, a relay MF detects when the supply is within its normal voltage limits, and shortly afterwards the motor-generator is switched back to this supply. The comparison circuit is now used to detect lack of synchronism, and, as long as there is such a lack, a relay SYN in the circuit of thyratron V5 is held operated. When the output from the motor-generator is in phase with the mains, the relay releases and connects a coil of the contactor CO to a charged capacitor C10 which discharges through the coil and re-connects the load to the mains. In order to ensure that full output of the stand-by source is reached more quickly after mains failure is detected, a capacitor charged from the alternating-current supply may be used to boost the battery voltage during the starting period of the inverter.

Nov. 19, 1910, [Convention date]. Plant; balacing moving parts; regulating. -Relates to improvements in the invention described in Specification 25,662/11, in which turbines are provided with reversed drum stages so that the resultant e n d - thrust balances the propeller thrust, and consists in the application of the invention to marine plants in which the high- and low-pressure turbine elements are arranged on different shafts, and in the provision of valves for effecting adjustment of balance. The highpressure element comprises impulse stages mounted on wheels 18, 19, 20, Fig. 1, on which the steam acts successively, after which it passes through a drum stage 28, the endthrust produced up to this point being from left to right. The steam is then led through pipes 32 to another drum stage 34 which it traverses from right to left, thereby producing a right-hand thrust. The resultant end-thrust balances the propeller thrust. The first set of nozzles 25 are provided with valves 38, and the subsequent sets of nozzles 26, 27 with slide or lift valves. By manipulating these valves, the balance can be adjusted under various conditions of working. After leaving the highpressure element, the steam passes by way of a pipe 37 to a low-pressure element arranged on a separate shaft. It first traverses a drum stage 48, Fig. 6, from left to right, and then traverses another drum stage 56 from right to left. The resultant end-thrust balances the propeller thrust on that shaft. In a modification, a fourshaft installation is described, consisting of a duplication of the arrangement described above. In a modification for a three-shaft installation, reversed drum stages are not used in the highpressure element, as the end-thrust can be wholly balanced by the propeller thrust, but the low-pressure elements on the side shafts are provided with reversed-flow stages as shown in Fig. 6. The steam, after passing through the high-pressure turbine, passes through the lowpressure turbines in parallel.

Aug. 7, 1964 [Sept. 20, 1963], No. 37183/63. Headings F2S and F2Q. A gear device comprises a driving member 20 attached to or integral with a drive member 21 and a resilient member 35 extending between the driving and driven members and being attached to or integral with one of the members. A chamber 36 is defined by the resilient member and the other member, and means e.g. holes, 43, are provided for introducing fluid into the chamber 36 to damper relative vibrations of the driving and driven members. In the construction shown the resilient member is metallic and the inner periphery forms an interference fit with a seating 40 of driven member 21 while the outer periphery is urged against an annular face 41 of the driving member by its own resilience. The driving and drive members 20, 21 co-operate with a gear wheel 13 and a bevel gear 16 respectively. The gear device is disposed within a fluid-filled casing such that fluid enters the chamber 36 through holes 43 and on the centrifugal force of the fluid reaching a certain level, the outer periphery of the resilient member is urged away from its seat to allow the flow of fluid through the chamber. In a further embodiment the resilient member comprises a flange, integral with the driven member and attached to a face of the driving member by a plurality of bolts. The inner periphery of the flange is scalloped to provide a plurality of chambers and an inlet thereto, fluid again distorting the outer periphery of the resilient member at a certain pressure (Figs. 3, 4, not shown). The gear device may form part of a gas-turbine engine (Fig. 1, not shown).",ROLLS ROYCE,GORDON FRANCES CHARLES,,https://lens.org/035-334-687-379-336,Granted Patent,no,0,0,4,5,0,F02C7/36;;F16F15/16;;F16H1/14;;F16H1/203;;F16H55/14;;Y10T74/19907;;F16F15/10;;Y10T74/19907;;F02C7/36;;F16H55/14;;F16H1/14;;F16F15/16;;F16H1/203;;F16F15/10,F02C7/36;;F16F15/16;;F16H1/14;;F16H1/20;;F16H55/14,F2Q Q7A3X         -;;F2Q Q7H1          Q7H;;F2Q Q7H2B         Q7H;;F2Q Q7H3          Q7H;;F2S SCN           SCN;;F2S S10C2B        S10;;F2S S10C2X        S10;;F2S S10D3C        S10,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Oct. 3, A.D. 1902, [date applied for under Patents Act, A.D. 1901]. Slotting; planing and shaping. -Relates to improvements in the type of machine described in Specification No. 6618, A,D. 1902, for cutting curved slots across the peripheral surface of turbine or other discs, rings, or segments. The work is clamped to an index-plate vertically adjustable on a bracket 3 on the bed 2, and is held in the indexed position by a clamp 6. The bracket and clamp are connected by a rod 7, and are advanced after each cut by the intermittent rotation of a screw 9. The cutting-tool 10 is held in a spindle 11, Fig. 4, eccentrically mounted in a sleeve 12 which is eccentrically mounted in a barrel 13 rotated in bearings 14 by gearing 15 from a pulley 16. The sleeve 12 is connected to a plate 20 on the barrel by links 19, Fig. 6, a roller 21 on one of the links engaging a stationary cam-track 22 so that the sleeve is turned in the barrel during the rotation of the tool to produce the ""orbital"" movement of the tool described in the prior Specification. The plate 20 is connected by a similar arrangement to a block 26 feathered on the tool spindle so that the tool is maintained normal to the cut. The tool is withdrawn during the idle portion of its movement by a link 33 connected by ball joints to a block 31 on the spindle, and to an arm 32 on a shaft 34 rocked by a cam 36 on a shaft driven from the pulley 16. The cam returns the spindle to the cutting position, the spindle being then held longitudinally by a guide-plate 38 on it passing between plates 39, 40 on a stationary frame 41, the separation of the plates 39, 40 being adjusted by wedges, the plate 38 engaging the plates 39, 40 only during the cutting movement. The block 26 is held against longitudinal movement by engagement with the plate 20.",CURTIS CHARLES GORDON,CURTIS CHARLES GORDON,,https://lens.org/182-877-235-844-461,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

NORTH AMERICAN ROCKWELL CORP. 20 June, 1966, No. 27496/66. Heading H1K. A monolithic structure suitable for the manufacture of solid circuits consists of a series of mutually insulated monocrystalline semi-conductor bodies of opposite conductivity types. A typical structure is formed by grooving a uniform resistivity N-type silicon wafer, oxidizing or nitriding the grooved surface and then burying the grooves in vapour deposited silicon, beryllia or alumina. The ungrooved face is next lapped down to the grooves to isolate the regions of the wafer defined thereby and holes cut through other regions of the assembly. One face of a corresponding oxidized P-type silicon wafer provided with mesas to mate with the holes, is fitted to the N-type wafer and silicon deposited in the holes to form the monolithic structure shown in section in Fig. 8. The back face of the P wafer 35 is then lapped to leave the mesas as oxide coated islands and to reexpose the N-type islands at the same face of the structure. In an alternative method, mesas are formed on a P-type wafer, mated with corresponding holes in an N-type wafer and the holes filled with vapour deposited silicon, the wafers having previously been oxidized. The P-types mesas are isolated and the N-type material exposed by lapping as before and isolated bodies of N-type formed subsequently. This is done by grooving the exposed N-type material down to the vapour deposited silicon, oxidizing the grooved surface, burying it beneath vapour deposited silicon and lapping from the opposite face of the assembly down to the grooves to expose both the N and P-type islands. Where the vapour deposited material is adequately insulating the oxide or nitride layers may be dispensed with.",NORTH AMERICAN ROCKWELL,GODEJAHN GORDON CHARLES,,https://lens.org/039-303-403-368-461,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,H01L27/0826;;H01L21/76297;;H01L23/29;;H01L2924/0002,H01L21/762;;H01L23/29;;H01L27/082,H1K KGC           GC;;H1K KGCC          GCC;;H1K K11Y          GC;;H1K K2S10         GC;;H1K K2S20         GC;;H1K K3SY          GC;;H1K K3TY          GC;;H1K K3T1C         GC;;H1K K5BX          GC;;H1K K5B2          GC;;H1K K5B3          GC;;H1K K5CY          GC;;H1K K5C3A         GC;;H1K K5C3G         GC;;H1K K5EY          GC;;H1K K5E3          GC;;H1K K5M1          GC,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   An apparatus and method is disclosed that configures two files for more rapid comparison by removing blank spaces from the code of all of the lines in each of the files to be compared and also by attaching a control to the beginning of each line of code in each of the two sources prior to be compared. After blank spaces are removed and the controls attached, the two files are compared to determine additions, deletions and changes. The program continues to compare the strings of identical length until all of the strings have been compared. By comparing only strings of identical length, the program is able to compare two sources in substantially less time than by using conventional means of comparison.

Each of the controllers (18, 19, 19A) respectively serves as an interface between the central processor and at least one storage unit (12, 13) or input/output device (14). In order for the controllers to distinguish between addresses, the addresses sent from the central processor contain identifier segments indicative of the controller to which the address is being sent. Controllers in turn contain programmable comparison means (20, 21, 22) for comparing the identifier segments in addresses to a stored controller identifier indicative of the controller. Because the comparison means are programmable, controller identifiers have to be set up each time the system is turned on. Consequently, the present invention provides such turn on or initialization means including a read-only initialization program stored in one of the storage units: the controller interfacing with this storage unit becomes a master controller; the master controller has apparatus which is selectively activated only during initialization for accepting all addresses irrespective of the identifier segment. The other controllers have apparatus selectively activated only during initialization for disabling the comparison means and such other controllers so that no addresses are accepted by the other controllers during the initialization. In other words, the comparison means in the master controller is completely bypassed during initialization whereby the read-only initialization program is accessed only through the master controller.",INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION,"WRIGHT, CHARLES GORDON",,https://lens.org/105-799-628-577-68X,Search Report,yes,3,0,7,7,0,G06F9/4411;;G06F9/4411,G06F1/24;;G06F9/445;;G06F12/06;;G06F13/14,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Turning-gear. ROLLS-ROYCE, Ltd. April 6, 1948. No. 9675. [Class 7 (v)] A starting turbine 10 drives through epicyclic gearing a dog clutch member 14 engaging a clutch member 15 on the engine shaft, and a friction clutch 35 locks the epicyclic gear as a solid drive when the turbine starts to rotate, the clutch 35 being disengaged when the turbine speed, or alternatively the torque transmitted to the shaft 15, reaches a predetermined value to allow the epicyclic to act as a speed reduction gear. The epicyclic gearing comprises a sun gear 18a meshing with planet gears 22 attached to a planet carrier 23 integral with a screw threaded sleeve 25, an annular gear 20 meshing with the gears 22 comprising the torque reaction member and having a pawl and ratchet free-wheel clutch 38, 39 which allows the gear 20 to rotate in the same direction as the sun gear 18a when the clutch 35 is engaged, but prevents it rotating in the opposite direction. The sun gear 18a is driven from the turbine rotor 10a through epicyclic gearing comprising a sun wheel 16, planet wheels 17 on a planet carrier 18 carrying the wheel 18a, and teeth 19 on the gear 20. The sleeve 25 cooperates with a threaded sleeve 26 with a bolt 27 fixed therein carrying at one end the member 14 splined to the sleeve 26 at 14b and loaded by a spring 29 and at the other end a spider 30 rotatably connected to the sleeve 26 through a torque spring 34 and having arms 31 slidably engaged with push rods 32 carried by the planet carrier 23. The friction clutch comprises a disc 35 splined to the gear 20, a disc 36 on the carrier 23, and a disc 36a splined to the sleeve 25 and forced to the engaging position by a spring 37. When the turbine starts to rotate, the clutch 35 and 36a being engaged to lock the planet carrier 23 to the gear 20, the sleeve 25 is driven at the same speed as the turbine and relative rotation between the sleeves 25, 26 moves the latter to the right to engage the claws 14, 15. The increase in torque restrains sleeve 26 from rotating and it is moved farther to the right by the screw thread to cause the arms 31 to engage flanges 33 on the push rods 32 and move the disc 36a to disengage the clutch at a torque value dependant upon the spring 37, whereby the sleeve 25 is driven through the reduction gearing at a reduced speed and rotates the sleeve 26 and member 14. When the engine starts and the fluid is cut off from the turbine 10, the springs 29, 37 move the sleeve 26 and spider 30 back, and re-engage the clutch 35 whereby the turbine is forced to slow down and impart some of its kinetic energy to the engine shaft. The member 14 moves axially out of engagement when the member 15 begins to overrun it, the tension spring 34 retaining it in the retracted position. In a modification the pawl and ratchet 39, 38 may be replaced by a wedging roller type free-wheel, and the clutch member 36a may be disengaged by a centrifugal governor when the turbine motor speed exceeds a'selected value.",ROLLS ROYCE,GORDON FRANCIS CHARLES,,https://lens.org/117-781-703-279-077,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,3,0,F02N7/08;;F02N15/046;;F02N15/046;;F02N7/08,F02N7/08;;F02N15/04,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Turning-gear; starting. ROLLSROYCE, Ltd. Oct. 6, 1947, No. 26856. [Class 7(v)] [Also in Group XXI] In a cartridge breech for a starter device comprising a barrel 10, Fig. 1, into which the cartridge is inserted and a breech cap 11 detachably secured to the barrel 10 to close the breech end thereof, the cap is adapted to receive the base end of the cartridge within it and is provided with clip means, such as levers 21, Fig. 2, operative to provide positive location of the cartridge with the cap against movement of the cartridge in any direction relative to the cap by engaging with a shoulder on the cartridge base, whereby, in use, the cartridge can be engaged with the cap 11 and simultaneous insertion of the cartridge into the barrel and engagement of the cap 11 with the barrel 10 can be effected with the cartridge acting as a guide for the cap. The cap 11 comprises a main cap 13 prpviding a breech face 14, Fig. 2, against which bears the cartridge base, a cylindrical skirt 15 screwed by a simple or multiple interrupted thread into the barrel and an auxiliary cap 17 which is secured to the main cap 13 and formed with a handle 20. The levers 21, which are located within a space 19 comprised between the main and auxiliary caps 13, 17, serve both to hold the cartridge against the breech face 14 and to extract it after firing. The nose end of each lever 21 extends through a slot in the main cap 13 and normally engages in front of the cartridge rim whilst the tail end of each lever can be engaged by a hand-operated sliding stud 23, housed in the auxiliary cap 17, in order to rock the levers 21 out of engagement with the cartridge rim. The breech cap 11 is locked by two other levers 27, Fig. 1, also positioned in the space 19, the noses of which normally engage splines 32 on the exterior of the barrel 10. The tail ends of the locking levers 27 abut a sliding plug 28 housed in the stem of the handle 20 and are rocked out of engagement with the barrel 10 when a plate 29 projecting from the end of the handle 20 is depressed by gripping the latter when screwing the breech cap 11 on to the barrel 10. The cartridge may be fired by percussion or electrically; in the latter case one side of a detonator cap is earthed and a contact 42 is connected to an electric source through a slip ring 47 on the skirt 15 and a spring contact 48, the last two making contact only when the cap 11 is almost screwed fully home. The noses of locking levers 27 may be arranged to ratchet over the splines 32 and one of levers 21 may be dispensed with.",ROLLS ROYCE,GORDON FRANCIS CHARLES,,https://lens.org/133-554-198-560-297,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,F02N13/00,F02N13/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A bellows is made by securing a reinforcing ring 10 to each end of a tube 4 and forming radially outwardly extending convolutions 11- 14 by rollers 5-7, as the tube rotates. In one embodiment, a single or multi-ply tube 4 is placed on a table 1 and a spindle 3 clamped in position such that rollers 6, 7 and guide rollers 8, 9 carried thereon bear against the outer surface of the tube. After positioning a spindle 2 such that a roller 5 carried thereon contacts the inner surface of the tube, the spindles 2, 3 are rotated to cause the tube to rotate. As the tube rotates, the spindle 2 is moved by an air cylinder towards the spindle 3 causing a convolution 11 to be formed. After disconnecting the drive to the spindles 2, 3 and moving back the spindle 2, the rollers 5-7 are axially moved on their respective spindles and the process repeated to form another convolution 12. When the desired number of convolutions has been formed, the rollers 5-7 may be replaced by radiused rollers to deepen the convolutions (Figs. 2-4, not shown). The tube may be rotated by separate drive means and may be supported on rollers. Guide rollers 8, 9 may also be positioned on the spindle 2.

   A method for enhancing or generating a water flow current by the generation of a velocity head differential, to guide fish, including: a venturi eductor to induce higher water pressures; a pump, piping or other motive water source; an adjustable frame to mount the venturi eductor; and a method of using this equipment. Fish may be guided into or away from a waterway area by generating or enhancing a current to guide them. The apparatus may be used as a method to guide fish through low velocity areas of a river, lake, reservoir or other waterway. The apparatus may also be used as a method to create water flow velocities that fish are reluctant to pass through for a barrier or curtain to further guide the fish. The apparatus and method may also be used to transfer temperature-variant water in a waterway.

A method of forming convolutions in a tube 3 comprises arranging a single roller 1 to bear against one wall of the tube and a pair of rollers 6, 7 to bear against the other wall of the tube, rotating the tube, moving the axes of the roller 1 and the rollers 6, 7 towards each other and simultaneously moving two of the rollers along their axis or axes towards the third roller. The tube is held on a machine bed 21 by a clamp 22, and when it is secured a machine tool post 5 is displaced vertically until the roller 1 is at the level of the convolution to be formed. A machine tool post 16 is moved along a guide 17 until the rollers 6, 7 are opposite the roller 1 and a housing 12 is moved along guide pins 15 until the rollers 6, 7 bear against the tube. The tube 3 is rotated, thereby rotating the rollers 1, 6, 7 and as the tube is rotated the roller 1 is moved laterally towards the rollers 6, 7. At the same time the tool post 5 is lowered and the roller 6 is lowered at twice the speed of the post 5. After forming one convolution the rollers may be disengaged and re-set vertically to form further convolutions.

Nov. 19, 1910, [Convention date]. Axial-flow type; balancing moving parts. - A marine turbine is provided with reversed drum stages so that the resultant end - thrust balances the propeller thrust. For forward driving, steam passes successively through impulse stages 9, 10, the shaft being reduced on the right-hand side of the former, whereby a left-hand thrust is obtained, and afterwards passes through pipes 30 external to the casing to the left-hand side of a drum stage 26, which it traverses from left to right. The action of the steam on this stage produces a right-hand thrust. The steam then passes into an annular chamber 32, whence it is led through pipes 33 to a second drum stage 35, which it traverses from right to left and passes thence to the exhaust 38. The action of the steam on this stage produces a left-hand thrust. The various stages are so designed that the resultant endthrust balances the propeller thrust. For reverse running, wheel stages 41, 42 and a drum stage 46 are provided. Inspecting internal parts.-To facilitate the removal and repair of the diaphragm packing, man-holes 20, 22, 44 are provided, and holes 21, 23 are provided in the running wheels.

The program divides each object into surfaces, subsurfaces, and elements and computes normals for the elements and normals for each subsurface. The program calculates the dot products between the subsurface normals. If the dot product is negative, the program computes the relative subsurface vector between the two subsurfaces and calculates the dot product between the first subsurface normal and the relative subsurface vector to determine if there is a possible collision of elements. If that dot product is negative, then the program calculates the dot product for the elemental normals. If that dot product is negative, then the program calculates the relative elemental vector and calculates the dot product between the first elemental normal and the relative elemental vector. If that dot product is negative, then the two objects have collided.

Elastic-fluid turbines.-Relates to an elastic-fluid turbine in which the vanes and guide-blades for the greater number of the stages have the same angles of entrance and exit, but increase in length towards the exhaust in accordance with a curve of volumes, so that an equal amount of energy is developed in each wheel. The drum C and the casing D are symmetrically curved to accommodate the blades, as shown in Fig. 2. In order to avoid the excessive lengths of blades in the later stages J, Fig. 3, the angles of entrance and exit are progressively increased, and the lengths of the blades are made uniform. Also to avoid having the blades in the first few stages E excessively short, the wheels are arranged, as shown, in small groups in separate casings in the form of jet turbines, only a portion, however, of the periphery of the wheels being acted upon at one time by the elastic fluids. The length of impact in these stages is increased from group to group in the direction of the flow.",CURTIS CHARLES GORDON,CURTIS CHARLES GORDON,,https://lens.org/165-932-376-359-630,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Nov. 19, 1910, [Convention date]. Axial-flow type; plant; balancing moving parts. -Relates to improvements in the invention described in Specification 25,662/11, and consists in the application and modification of that invention to marine turbine installations comprising high- and low-pressure elements A, B, Fig. 6, mounted upon alined shafts 7, 33 connected by a slip coupling 34. The element A is arranged to be selfbalancing, while the end - thrust of the element B is counterbalanced by the propeller thrust. The steam, on entering element A, passes successively through impulse stages 14, 19, Fig. 1, after which it passes through a drum stage 21. Up to this point, the end - thrust produced has been from left to right. The steam then passes through passages in the casing to the left-hand side of a drum stage 24, through which it passes from left to right, with the result that a righthand thrust is produced which counterbalances the opposing thrust produced by the previous stages. The steam then passes by way of passages 28 and pipes 40 to the element B, Fig. 6, in which no reversed drum stages are used, but in which the end-thrust is balanced by the propeller thrust. By-pass valves 30, 32, Fig. 1, are provided in the high-pressure element to effect adjustments of balance under various working conditions. In a two-shaft installation, steam first passes through a highpressure element C, Fig. 7, rendered selfbalancing by reversed-flow stages, then through a similarly balanced intermediate - pressure element D, after which it passes by way of pipes 67, 68 through two low-pressure elements E, F in parallel. The end-thrusts in the low-pressure elements counterbalance the propeller thrust. The shafts are provided with slip couplings 49, 66.",CURTIS CHARLES GORDON,CURTIS CHARLES GORDON,,https://lens.org/017-021-667-152-441,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,F01D13/00,F01D13/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Each of the controllers (18, 19, 19A) respectively serves as an interface between the central processor and at least one storage unit (12, 13) or input/output device (14). In order for the controllers to distinguish between addresses, the addresses sent from the central processor contain identifier segments indicative of the controller to which the address is being sent. Controllers in turn contain programmable comparison means (20, 21, 22) for comparing the identifier segments in addresses to a stored controller identifier indicative of the controller. Because the comparison means are programmable, controller identifiers have to be set up each time the system is turned on. Consequently, the present invention provides such turn on or initialization means including a read-only initialization program stored in one of the storage units: the controller interfacing with this storage unit becomes a master controller; the master controller has apparatus which is selectively activated only during initialization for accepting all addresses irrespective of the identifier segment. The other controllers have apparatus selectively activated only during initialization for disabling the comparison means and such other controllers so that no addresses are accepted by the other controllers during the initialization. In other words, the comparison means in the master controller is completely bypassed during initialization whereby the read-only initialization program is accessed only through the master controller.",IBM,WRIGHT CHARLES GORDON,,https://lens.org/154-608-930-801-307,Patent Application,yes,0,9,7,7,0,G06F9/4411;;G06F9/4411,G06F1/24;;G06F9/445;;G06F12/06;;G06F13/14,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A pneumatic percussive drill has a central water tube with a lateral opening communicating with a chamber, one wall of which is movable and an air controlling valve biased towards the closed position is opened by movement of the wall under pressure of water to admit compressed air to the motor of the drill. As shown, water under pressure enters the back head of a drill through a valve 9 and passes into a tube 16 having an opening 17 leading through a passage 19 to a chamber 20 formed between a flange 37 and a cap-shaped valve 39. Air under pressure enters the back head through a valve 2 and a portion passes through a channel 24 to enter a chamber 23 formed between the back head and the valve 39. When the water pressure is at a predetermined value the valve 39 moves against the air pressure in the chamber 23 and allows air to enter the distributing valve of the motor through a passage between a flange 26 on the valve and a seat 29 on the distributing valve casing 3. Should the water pressure fail or be reduced below the predetermined value, air pressure in the chamber 23 closes the valve 39 and operation of the drill is stopped.",CONS PNEUMATIC TOOL COMPANY LT,STEPHEN CHARLES GORDON,,https://lens.org/052-189-028-259-005,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,E21B21/013;;E21B21/013,B25D17/16;;E21B21/01,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

DEFENCE, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR. 1 Oct., 1969 [2 Oct., l968], No. 46779/68. Heading H2A. A linear stepper motor comprises first and second magnetically excited gripping members connected by a piezo-electric member, one gripping member, the connecting member and the other gripping member being cyclically energized to produce motion. As shown in Fig. 1, gripping members 7, 9 connected by a piezoelectric cylinder 11 rest in a V-shaped groove 3 in a rail 5 and each comprises a pair of polepieces 13, 15 with a solenoid 17 between them which, when excited, causes the polepieces to grip the groove. Fig. 2 shows another embodiment wherein opposite ends of the piezoelectric -cylinder 11 are connected to rods 21, 23 each supported in a bearing 25 adjacent to which is located a brake consisting of a pair of pivoted polepieces such as 31 which may be drawn together by a solenoid to grip the rod. In the further embodiment shown in Figs. 4 and 5 a piezo-electric cylinder 79 is located in a V-shaped groove in. a rail 43 consisting of a central block 45 and side walls 47, 49 of soft iron, the block being separated from the side walls by brass spacers 51, 53. Located in the base of the rail is a pair of solenoids 63, 65 with cores 59 connected to the side walls and block 45 so that solenoid 63 has a magnetic circuit including wall 49 and block 45 whilst the magnetic circuit of solenoid 65 includes wall 47 and block 45. The cylinder 79 has triangular end pieces 67, 69 each comprising a soft iron portion and a brass portion, e.g. end-piece 67 has a soft-iron portion 73 bridging wall 47 and block 45 and a brass portion 71 engaging wall 49. Thus, energization of solenoid 65 will cause it to grip wall 47. The end piece 69 is arranged to grip wall 49 on energization of solenoid 63. Connection to the cylinder 79 is made via the rail 43 and a brush 83 co-operating with a gold wire 85. As before, cyclic energization of one solenoid, the cylinder and the other solenoid produces movement of the cylinder along the rail. The electromagnetic gripping members may incorporate permanent magnets to hold the motor stationary when the solenoids are de-energized, the magnets being opposed by current passing through the solenoids.",SECR DEFENCE,JOYCE GORDON CHARLES;;WILSON GORDON CAIRNS,,https://lens.org/028-691-154-925-13X,Granted Patent,no,0,5,1,1,0,H02N2/023,H01L41/09,H1E EAGE          EAGE;;H2A AGE           A1T;;H2A AGE           GE;;H2A A1N           A1N,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The applicator is attached to a pressurized canister filled with resin that forces the resin through the applicator's channel, into a space between the applicator's spatula and the panel's edge. The sidewalls of the applicator guide the applicator along the edge of the panel as it is drawn along to fill the edge and also to prevent spill over. The aft-end of the applicator body is a spatula that tapers toward the panel's edge and acts to smooth the resin flush with the panel's sidewalls. A finger guide allows the applicator to work using finger pressure. The applicator is drawn along with the hands, and where the leading edge of the applicator body rests on the panel there is a rounded lip to allow the applicator to traverse smoothly over roughness and imperfections on the panel's edge. The rounded lip feature also function s as a pivot that allows the applicator to be pivoted in such a way that the sidewalls will rise above the panel's edge so that the applicator can clear obstacles like adjoining panels without having to be removed from the panel being filled. Ribbing on the underside of the spatula facilitates the flow of resin over t he entire edge of the panel. The applicator maybe fashioned to accommodate varying panel thickness or edge profile, such as straight, angled, or bullnosed. The applicator may also be used to apply adhesives to the edges of solid panels.

The buckle comprises a swimming goggle edge buckle body, a rotary shaft and a head belt. A hollow column is formed at one end of the head belt, a pair of mounting grooves is formed in the corresponding positions of the upper wall and the lower wall of the swimming goggle edge buckle body, and the upper wall and the lower wall of the swimming goggle edge buckle body are connected as a whole through a first side wall, a second side wall and a cross beam. The mounting grooves are close to the first side wall, the end, with the hollow column, of the head belt firstly penetrates through the cross beam of the edge buckle body, covers the half edge of the cross beam in the head belt, then penetrates through a head belt hole in one side of the swimming goggles from inside to outside and is folded back, finally the hollow column is arranged on the rotary shaft in a sleeving mode and is rotatably connected into the mounting grooves, and the hollow column is closely attached to the head belt. The buckle of the swimming goggles is ingenious in structure and high in comfort degree, the effect of adjusting the tightness of the head belt can be fast achieved by moving the edge buckle body of the swimming goggles front and back, and the adjusting process is very convenient. Due to the fact that the head belt is closely attached to the hollow column when folded back to penetrate through the cross beam, friction force is increased, the slip limiting effect is better, and it is ensured that the swimming goggles are used normally for a long time.",YANGYANG SPORTING GOODS SUZHOU CO LTD,RATTRAY CHARLES GORDON YUNGMING,,https://lens.org/188-244-752-856-573,Patent Application,no,7,4,1,1,0,,A63B33/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

    A door assembly is provided comprising a plurality of interlocked door panels. Each of the door panels defines a length dimension, a height dimension, and a thickness dimension. Each of the door panels also defines a female portion, a male portion, and a panel body portion. The female portion and the male portion are defined near opposite extremes of the height dimension. The panel body portion mechanically couples the female portion to the male portion. The female portion defines an inside diameter. The male portion defines an outside diameter. The inside diameter of the female portion is sized to accommodate the outside diameter of the male portion. Each of the door panels are interlocked to an adjacent one of the door panels via accommodation of a male portion of one of the panels within a female portion of another of the panels. The female portion is preferably a rigid metal, e.g., Aluminum, and the male and panel body portions are preferably a plastic material, e.g., polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The weight of a door assembly according to the present invention is minimized by forming a majority or substantial portion of each panel of the door assembly from a light weight plastic material (e.g., polyvinyl chloride (PVC)).

Because the mirror does not have a via in the middle connecting to the underlying spring support, there is an improved contrast ratio that results from not having light scatter off the legs or vias like existing technologies. Because there are no supporting contacts, the mirror can be made smaller making smaller pixels that can be used to make higher density displays. In addition, because there is not restoring force from any supporting spring support, the mirror stays in place facing one or other direction due to adhesion. This means there is no need to use a voltage to hold the mirror in position.

The phosphonate mixture may be employed in an amount of 0.2 to about 95% of the polyol component (e.g. a polyester or a polyether or a mixture thereof) contained in a urethane foam system which may also include a blowing agent, a catalyst and a surfactant. The polyol phosphonate may be blended by conventional means with the other components of the urethane foam system at 0-150 DEG C. In Examples 22-26 the hydroxyl-containing polymer employed is derived from trimethylol propane and adipic and the isocyanate employed is a toluene diisocyanate. In Example 27, triphenyl phosphite and isobutanol are reacted at 120-130 DEG C. in the presence of a minor amount of sodium hydride, subsequently with an oxypropylated Novolak (mol. weight 425 and off number 396) at 130-140 DEG C. and the resulting reaction mixture was isomerized by adding epichlorhydrin followed by heating at 140-150 DEG C. The product is identified as oxypropylated Novolak isobutyl epichlorhydrin phosphonate and oxypropylated Novolak isobutyl phosphonate.ALSO:The invention comprises a mixture of phosphonates falling within at least two of the following classes: <FORM:1093893/C2/1> <FORM:1093893/C2/2> <FORM:1093893/C2/3> wherein n is 0 or 1, R3, R4, R5 and R6 are independently alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl and heterocyclic, R1 is hydrogen or one of the groups listed under R3, R4, R5 and R6, Z is alkyl substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, alkylene or substituted alkylene, and in which the phosphonates of classes (b) and (c) each contain from 2 to 12 free hydroxyl groups and the phosphonates of class (a) contain from 3 to 12 free hydroxyl groups. The invention also includes a process for preparing a mixture of phosphonates which comprises reacting one mole of a triorgano phosphite with more than one mole, but less than three moles, of a polyhydric compound of the formula R7(OH)m in which R7 is alkylene, aralkylene, haloalkyl, aryl, alkaryl, haloaryl, alkenylene, substituted alkenylene, heterocyclic and substituted heterocyclic and m is an integer from 2 to 12, to form a mixture of phosphites, and rearranging the mixture of phosphites to form a corresponding mixture of phosphonates. The transesterification of the triorgano phosphite with the polyhydric compound is preferably effected in the presence of a conventional transesterification catalyst and the rearrangement of the phosphite to form the phosphonate may be effected by heating or by treatment with an Arbujov reagent (many being specified); the nature of the products may apparently be varied by varying the amount of Arbujov reagent employed. The reactions of the invention may be effected at temperatures of 25-300 DEG C. and the reaction may be conducted in situ without the removal of by-products until the desired phosphonate mixture is obtained.",HOOKER CHEMICAL CORP,BARANAUCKAS CHARLES FRANCIS;;GORDON IRVING,,https://lens.org/106-568-826-370-565,Granted Patent,no,0,2,5,7,0,C07F9/657181;;C07F9/40;;C08G18/388;;C08K5/5333;;C08K5/5357,C07F9/40;;C07F9/6571;;C08G18/38;;C08K5/5333;;C08K5/5357,C2P P1L1          -;;C2P P1L2          -;;C2P P1L3          -;;C2P P2E11A        -;;C2P P2E14         -;;C2P P2E19D        -;;C2P P2E26D        -;;C2P P3B11A        -;;C2P P3B11B        -;;C2P P3B12A        -;;C2P P3B12B        -;;C2P P3B13         -;;C2P P3B14A        -;;C2P P3B18B        -;;C2P P3B18C        -;;C2P P3B19C        -;;C2P P3B19D        -;;C2P P3B20         -;;C2P P6            -;;C2P P7            -;;C2P P9            P3B;;C3R R1B1          R1P;;C3R R1E2B         R1P;;C3R R1N1M1        R1P;;C3R R1N2H         R1P;;C3R R1N2QX        R1P;;C3R R1N2Q3        R1P;;C3R R1N2X         R1P;;C3R R32B1B        R32K;;C3R R32B2A2       -;;C3R R32D1         -;;C3R R32D10        R32K;;C3R R32D16A       R32K;;C3R R32D2         R32K;;C3R R32D6C        -;;C3R R32D9B1       R32K;;C3R R32E2A        R32K;;C3R R32E2D2       R32K;;C3R R32E2E        R32K;;C3R R32E2G        R32K;;C3R R32E2Y        R32K;;C3R R32F3         R32K;;C3R R32G1X        R32K;;C3R R32G1Y        R32K;;C3R R32H1         R32K;;C3R R32H2         R32K;;C3R R32H9A        R32K;;C3R R32J2F        R32K;;C3R R32J2Y        R32K;;C3R R32KC         R32K;;C3R R32P5AY       R32K;;C3R R32P5A2       R32K,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The method requires the introduction of a flaw in an optical fiber to be cleaved, and the application of predetermined stress and strain to the optical fiber in the vicinity of the flaw to cause curved-angle cleaving of the optical fiber at the flaw. More particularly, one embodiment of the method requires fixing first and second portions of the optical fiber, for example, by clamping, and introducing a flaw into the optical fiber between the first and second portions. Then, a substantially concentrated force is applied to the optical fiber between the flaw and the first portion of the optical fiber, on a side of the optical fiber opposite the flaw, in order to cause the optical fiber to cleave with a curved-angle cleave. Another embodiment of the method applies a substantially concentrated force to the fiber before introduction of the flaw. The apparatus of the present invention includes first and second pairs of optical fiber clamps separated by first predetermined distance, a flaw-producing device that produces a flaw in a fiber clamped between the clamps, and a force-applying device that applies a substantially concentrated force to the fiber at a second predetermined distance from the first pair of clamps, the flaw-producing device being located between the force-applying device and the second pair of optical fiber clamps at third predetermined distance from the force-applying device. The first, second and third predetermined distances are selected in order produce a curved-angle cleave in the optical fiber. The invention also contemplates a conversion kit which is useable to convert an existing square-angle optical fiber cleaver into a curved-angle optical fiber cleaver. Finally, the invention also includes a curved-angle end-face of an optical fiber that results from operating the apparatus of the present invention, in accordance with the method of the present invention.",MINNESOTA MINING & MFG,MANSFIELD CHARLES M;;WIEGAND GORDON,,https://lens.org/041-524-781-316-635,Granted Patent,yes,25,22,9,9,0,G02B6/25;;G02B6/3822;;Y10T225/386;;Y10T225/18;;Y10T225/16;;Y10T225/325;;Y10T225/12;;Y10T225/386;;Y10T225/18;;Y10T225/16;;Y10T225/325;;Y10T225/12;;G02B6/25;;G02B6/3822,G02B6/25;;G02B6/38,225/2;;225/4;;225/5,6,2,018-760-812-415-208;;013-871-492-386-814,10.1080/01418618808204506;;10.1109/jlt.1986.1074902,"Alcatel, Alcatel 4018 Multifunction Fiber Cleaver, 1992.;;Bellcore, Generic Requirements Bulletin , 1993.;;Bellcore, Generic Requirements for Optical Fiber Cleaving Tools, Technical Advisory TA NWT 000264, Issue 2, 1992.;;Fields et al., Cleavage of Optical Fibres Following Diamond Wedge Indentation, Philosophical Magazine A. , 57(2):151 171, 1988.;;Haibara et al., Design and Development of an Automatic Cutting Tool for Optical Fibers, Journal of Lightwave Technology , LT 4(9):1434 1439, 1986.;;Matsumoto et al., A Simple and Practical Cutting Tool for Optical Fiber End Preparation, The Transactions of the IECE of Japan , E 66(11):661 665, 1983.",EXPIRED

   An elongated packaging device is provided for packaging at least one disc-shaped item such as, for example, a recording media disc such as a CD, a CD-ROM or a DVD, together with other materials relating to such disc or otherwise in a stacked relationship. The packaging device includes a first member or wafer for the storage of disc-shaped media in a first chamber and a second member or container for the storage of a beverage in a second chamber, which container is sealed by a cover having an opening at the center thereof for the insertion of a straw. The first chamber is an annular inner chamber for receiving the disc media and includes a cylindrical inner structure defining central support for the disc media by means of the annular opening at the center thereof, such that the disc media is allowed to rotate, while limiting the linear movement of the disc media both perpendicular to and parallel to the plane of the media. The inner structure includes an aperture therethrough, which aperture aligns with the opening of the cover when the wafer is in place on the cover. The disc-shaped media is sealed within the annular inner chamber of the wafer by means of a circular protective element which engages the cylindrical inner structure and the perimeter of the wafer, thereby preventing the passage of any substance into the inner chamber of the wafer. In the preferred embodiment, the protective element is heat-sealed to the inner structure and perimeter of the wafer, although other attachment means, such as adhesives, or sealing compression fits, are contemplated. A means for penetration is disposed in the center of the protective element such that the penetration means is aligned with the aperture through the inner structure such that a straw may be inserted through the means for penetration, the aperture in the inner structure and the opening in the cover in order to gain access to the beverage. In the preferred embodiment, the means for penetration comprises an X shaped incision known as a kiss cut. A method is further provided for packaging such disc-shaped item and other material within the packaging device.

An obstructor 3 in the form of an extension to a piston 36 is urged by a spring 17 into engagement with an annular groove 7 in the sleeve 4 and prevents movement of the sleeve to open the air valve. Water under pressure is introduced through an inlet 11 and by way of passages 13 and 16 enters a space 1 above the piston 36. When the water pressure is sufficient to overcome the resistance of the spring 17 the piston is moved to retract the obstructor from the groove 7, so allowing the sleeve to move and open the air valve. The stem 39 of a water supply valve 20 engages a cam 19 on the surface of,the sleeve and opens the water valve during the lost motion movement of the sleeve. The opening of the water valve takes place before the opening of the air valve so that water is supplied to sprayers 8 before the drill starts operating.",CONS PNEUMATIC TOOL COMPANY LT,RITCHIE WILLIAM;;STEPHEN CHARLES GORDON,,https://lens.org/121-636-155-488-09X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,E21B21/01;;E21B21/01,E21B21/01,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The method requires the introduction of a flaw in an optical fiber to be cleaved, and the application of predetermined stress and strain to the optical fiber in the vicinity of the flaw to cause curved-angle cleaving of the optical fiber at the flaw. More particularly, one embodiment of the method requires fixing first and second portions of the optical fiber, for example, by clamping, and introducing a flaw into the optical fiber between the first and second portions. Then, a substantially concentrated force is applied to the optical fiber between the flaw and the first portion of the optical fiber, on a side of the optical fiber opposite the flaw, in order to cause the optical fiber to cleave with a curved-angle cleave. Another embodiment of the method applies a substantially concentrated force to the fiber before introduction of the flaw. The apparatus of the present invention includes first and second pairs of optical fiber clamps separated by first predetermined distance, a flaw-producing device that produces a flaw in a fiber clamped between the clamps, and a force-applying device that applies a substantially concentrated force to the fiber at a second predetermined distance from the first pair of clamps, the flaw-producing device being located between the force-applying device and the second pair of optical fiber clamps at third predetermined distance from the force-applying device. The first, second and third predetermined distances are selected in order produce a curved-angle cleave in the optical fiber. The invention also contemplates a conversion kit which is useable to convert an existing square-angle optical fiber cleaver into a curved-angle optical fiber cleaver. Finally, the invention also includes a curved-angle end-face of an optical fiber that results from operating the apparatus of the present invention, in accordance with the method of the present invention.",MINNESOTA MINING & MFG,MANSFIELD CHARLES M;;WIEGAND GORDON,,https://lens.org/152-319-430-550-800,Granted Patent,yes,25,27,9,9,0,G02B6/25;;G02B6/3822;;Y10T225/386;;Y10T225/18;;Y10T225/16;;Y10T225/325;;Y10T225/12;;Y10T225/386;;Y10T225/18;;Y10T225/16;;Y10T225/325;;Y10T225/12;;G02B6/25;;G02B6/3822,G02B6/25;;G02B6/38,385/134;;385/134;;225/2;;225/96.5,6,2,018-760-812-415-208;;013-871-492-386-814,10.1080/01418618808204506;;10.1109/jlt.1986.1074902,"Alcatel, Alcatel 4018 Multifunction Fiber Cleaver, 1992.;;Bellcore, Generic Requirements Bulletin , 1993.;;Bellcore, Generic Requirements for Optical Fiber Cleaving Tools, Technical Advisory TA NWT 000264, Issue 2, 1992.;;Fields et al., Cleavage of Optical Fibres Following Diamond Wedge Indentation, Philosophical Magazine A. , 57)2):151 171, 1988.;;Haibara et al., Design and Development of an Automatic Cutting Tool for Optical Fibers, Journal of Lightwave Technology , LT 4(9):1434 1439, 1986.;;Matsumoto et al., A Simple and Practical Cutting Tool for Optical Fiber End Preparation, The Transactions of the IECE of Japan , E 66(11):661 665, 1983.",EXPIRED

As described the element 2 consists of a cylindrical glass block of square section, and each square of 5 stores 1 bit of each of 128 X 128 69-bit words. A photocell 6 behind each square enables parallel read-out of a word corresponding to the position of a spot on the face of tube 1; this position is encoded according to its horizontal and vertical co-ordinates by photographic coding plate 8 and photo-cells 9 and fed to a digital address comparator receiving also a required digital address, the error signal acting through an integrating amplifier to correct the spot position. In a modification, each of the 128 x 128 spot positions of each square has an individual converging lens formed by the combination of one of 128 plano-convex horizontal cylindrical lenses in a plastic sheet 24, and one of 128 similar vertical lenses in a sheet 23. These sheets are formed into an element similar to the plate 5, but spaced from it and by use of horizontal and vertical shutters in the lens 4 (now a twoelement lens) the spot for each of the 128 x 128 positions may be selected to fall on one of 8 x 8 sub-positions, the eight possible positions for the horizontal and vertical shutters being selected by electromagnets.",FERRANTI LTD,SCARROTT GORDON GEORGE;;JOHNSON KENNETH CHARLES,,https://lens.org/038-446-587-320-228,Granted Patent,no,0,3,6,7,0,G03B21/00;;G11C13/04;;H01J29/89;;H01J2229/8926;;H01J29/89;;H01J2229/8926;;G03B21/00;;G11C13/04,G03B21/00;;G11C13/04;;H01J29/89,G4A A10A          G;;G4A A10D          G;;G4A A6X           G;;G4C CRM           ARM;;G4C CRM           CRM;;G4C C1X           CRM;;G4C C17B3         CRM;;G4C C2B1          CRM;;G4C C2F           CRM;;G4C C2X           CRM,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Standby supply systems. STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES, Ltd. Nov. 29, 1954, No. 34581/54. Class 38 (4). In standby supply plant for a load normally supplied from A.C. mains, of the kind wherein a synchronous machine, coupled to a flywheel, normally motors on the mains but becomes clutched to a prime mover upon mains failure so as to start the latter and then to be driven by it to supply the load, the load of the defective mains on the standby plant is removed immediately upon their failure by a static device responsive to reverse power flow arranged to insert impedance between the mains and the synchronous machine. The device may comprise a transformer T1 having its primary winding in series with the mains supply and its secondary winding normally loaded by thyratrons V1, V2 which are caused to conduct by suitably phased firing potentials applied over transformer T2 from a phase-shift circuit R1, C2 energized by a transformer T3 connected across the synchronous machine. The transformer T1 thus normally presents little impedance between the mains and the synchronous machine. On mains failure, however, the phase reversal at the anodes of the thyratrons caused by the machine attempting to supply the defective mains, renders the thyratrons non- conducting, so that the transformer T1 is now an effective impedance to limit current flow into the mains. The voltage developed across a biasing tertiary winding 6, 7 of the transformer also increases to such a value as to maintain the thyratrons blocked. Upon mains restoration, the device acts to effect resynchronization. During normal mains supply, the automatic voltage control system associated with the synchronous machine so controls its excitation (and thus the phase of the votage across an inductance LL-which may be the leakage inductance of transformer T1) as to maintain the outgoing voltage constant.",STANDARD TELEPHONES CABLES LTD,BENNETT GORDON CHARLES;;PENFORD JAMES EDWIN,,https://lens.org/059-168-740-544-899,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,H02J9/066;;Y02B70/30;;Y04S20/20,H02J9/06,H2H HAH           AH/J/K;;H2H HAJ           AH/J/K;;H2H HAK           AH/J/K,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Logical gating circuits. FERRANTI Ltd. June 24, 1957 [June 28, 1956; Dec. 11, 1956], Nos. 19986/56 and 37761/57. Class 40(6). A logical circuit comprises a summing transformer having a number of primary windings and one secondary winding a clock pulse generator being connected to a capacitor connected to the secondary winding so that the charge is modified during each period only if the secondary current during that period is of a predetermined sense and value. The output of the capacitor is connected to a stabilized amplifier which conducts during each output period only if the charge has been modified to the predetermined extent during the preceding period, the secondary winding being D.C. restored during each output period. Fig. 1 shows a logical stage in which primary current pulses in windings 11, 12, 13 during each input period defined by pulse trains 26, 29 Fig. 2, applied to terminals 26, 29 respectively are comcombined to produce their alegbraic sum in secondary winding 14. If during any input period this sum exceeds a predetermined value diode 16 passes current to modify the charge in capacitor 25 to a limit fixed by diode 27 and its associated bias source. Diode 27 absorbs surplus current in secondary 14 and prevents pentode 18 from conducting during any input period. At the start of the following output period the rise in voltage of waveform 26 causes pentode 18 to conduct only if the charge on capacitor 25 has been modified during the preceding period to the predertermined limit. The current by resistor 21 which during the input period only flowed in diode 22 is switched to pentode 18 and causes load 20 to be energized by a standard current pulse. The sloping top of waveform 26, Fig. 2, maintains the charge on capacitor 25 constant during each output period so that the grid voltage of amplifier tube 18 is held steady during each output period. The fall of voltage of tube 18 during each output period of waveform 29, Fig. 2, cuts off diode 28 to permit d.c restoration of transformer 10 during that period. Capacitor 25 is discharged by resistor 24 and damping resistor 15 ensures that the magnetization energy of the transformer 10 is dissipated and the logical function of the stage determined solely by the manner in which the primaries 11-13 are pulse energized, the biases and waveform applied to the stage remain the same in each case. To enable the stage to act as a three entry ""AND"" gate the three input pulses if occurring in the same input period are all applied positively to one only of the primaries each of the others carrying a negative pulse during each input period. If only one primary 12 or 13 carries a negative pulse the gate becomes a ""two out of three gate"" opening after each input period during which primary 11 carried any two of its positive pulses. If each primary winding is arranged to carry when required an OR gate is provided.

Because the mirror does not have a via in the middle connecting to the underlying spring support, there is an improved contrast ratio that results from not having light scatter off the legs or vias like existing technologies. Because there are no supporting contacts, the mirror can be made smaller making smaller pixels that can be used to make higher density displays. In addition, because there is not restoring force from any supporting spring support, the mirror stays in place facing one or other direction due to adhesion. This means there is no need to use a voltage to hold the mirror in position.

The tool (20) includes a claw assembly (21) utilising a manually operable expander (22) so that upon insertion of the claw assembly (21) into the filter element (11) the expander (22) can be employed to move the jaws (23) of the claw assembly to the position illustrated at (24). A lever (25) is used to extract the claw assembly (21) and thereby the filter element (11) from the cartridge (10).

AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE & ELECTRIC CO., Ltd. Jan. 9, 1951 [Jan. 17, 1950], No. 1157/50. Class 40 (iv). In an arrangement for answering, at the exchange, calls to absent subscribers or for monitoring incoming calls to subscribers troubled by malicious calls, the transmission from a manual board solely of a subscriber's directory number causes any subsequent incoming calls to that subscriber's line to be routed to the manual board. As shown, Fig. 1, an operator at the manual board MB may insert her plug into a special jack to engage a group selector GS. If she then dials or key-sends the required subscriber's number, a marking selector MS is set to the subscriber's line in a bank D of the normal final selectors FS and a marking condition is applied to the line when the operator withdraws her plug. Any subsequent incoming call to the marked line via the penultimate selector PS and the final selector FS is automatically diverted to the manual board MB via finders WF, JF and a relay set JRS. The operator may then complete the connection and either allow the call to proceed normally or release the called subscriber and trace the call if necessary. The manual board MB may be at a local or remote exchange. Group selector GS, Figs. 2, 3. This is engaged over conductors TWP and relay A repeats the first digit dialled by the operator to vertical magnet VM which raises the switch to the required level where it hunts over wipers P1, P2 for an idle line to a marking selector. If none is found, 11th step springs S2 substitute busy tone from lead 11 for dial tone from lead 10. If wiper P1 or P2 finds an idle line, relay HA or HB prepares an impulsing circuit to wiper B1 or B2 and thence to the seized marking selector. Marking selector MS, Fig. 4. Magnet WSM drives wipers WS1, WS2 in accordance with the second digit to select one of the wipers W1 ... W10 which are then set bv the third and fourth digits, a relay RC in the group selector switching the impulsing path for the third digit from the B wiper to the M wiper. At the end of the fourth digit RC re-operates and applies earth to the M wiper, relays EA, PT being already energized. This brings up a relay CO in the marking selector to connect battery via a relay KD, wiper WS2, and the selected one of the wipers W1 ... W10 to the required subscriber's contact in the bank D of the final selectors FS. This battery is replaced by earth from wiper WS1 when the operator withdraws her plug to release the group selector and relay CO. The subscriber's line is now marked in the final selectors by this earth. Release of marking selector and removal of marking. If the operator repeats the above operations, a second marking selector connects battery over its relay KD to the same contact in the final selectors, and the two relays KD operate in series. A relay EB in the first marking selector is energized and completes a self-interrupting circuit for rotary magnet RMA to initiate release. The second marking selector is released when the operator withdraws her plug. One marking selector differs from the rest in having a contact eb5 and the connection shown dotted in Fig. 4. In this case, when relay CO releases on the withdrawal of the operator's plug, relay KD operates and brings up relay EB to initiate release. This selector may be used only for releasing other marking selectors and not for marking. Final selector FS, Figs. 5, 6. This is engaged by an incoming call over group selector multiple GSM and responds to the last two digits of the wanted subscriber's number in normal manner. At the end of the final digit, relays AA, AB, ACA are held energized, relay AC releases and relay AE begins to release slowly. If the final selector has come to rest on a line marked in bank D1 or D2 by earth from the marking selector MS, a relay TW operates and locks in series with a relay ST in a start circuit SR, Fig. 7, over leads 22, 23. When relay AE completes its release, relay AC re-operates and extends battery via relay TW to a conductor C connected to a contact in a bank of a finder WF, Fig. 7. Finder equipment, Figs. 7, 8, 9. A start relay ST is energized in series with TW as described above and brings up relays STA, STB in a relay set JRS. Magnet JFM drives a finder JF until wiper JF1 reaches the contact associated with the operated ST relay, where it fails to find earth so that the finder JF stops, engaging a further finder WF. A relay K operates to energize a latch magnet LM in the engaged finder WF, which is then driven by magnet DM in search of the relevant final selector FS which is marked by battery on the conductor C. If this is found by wiper S1 or S2, a relay TA operates to release latch magnet LM and stop the finder WF, whereas if it is found by wiper S3 or S4 the finder is stopped by a relay TB which also brings up a relay AHA to energize wiper-switching relay SW. In either case, relays AH, HR operate to release relays STB, STA and extend the speech conductors into the relay set JRS. Relay LA operates in series with relay D in the final selector which releases start relay ST and performs metering functions. Ringing tone is now provided from lead 24, instead of from lead 15, Fig. 5, as previously. Relays DT, LB are energized in series, lighting a lamp LP at the manual board MB, and a circuit is completed for a thermal relay BTH. If the operator fails to answer, BTH releases the finder equipment and relays D, TW in the final selector, and the caller receives busy tone from lead 16, Fig. 5. If, however, the operator answers by inserting her plug P in jack TWJ before BTH can operate, a relay L extinguishes lamp LP, line-balancing relays ID, IA are energized, and a relay CR disconnects BTH and energizes relays AS, LR to disconnect ringing tone and release whichever of the relays TA, TB has been energized. The operator is now in communication with the caller over her speech conductors 26, 27. Operator completes connection to wanted line. By closing a key KS, the operator adds a further battery potential sufficient to operate relay LC in series with L. Relays LB, DT, ID are released and a relay BS operates, transferring earth from the conductor C to the conductor T leading to the final selector FS, thereby releasing relays TW, ACA and providing a test path for relay H to the wanted line via wiper P1 or P2. The call can then proceed normally. When the operator releases her key KS, relay LC is de-energized so that LB, DT, ID re-operate and AS, LA, D are released. Operator retakes control of connection. On a second operation of key KS, relay LC reoperates to release LB, DT, ID, BS. Earth is switched back from the conductor T to the conductor C, re-operating relays TW, ACA in the final selector, and relays LA, D, STB are re-energized. The release of key KS releases relay LC, and LB, DT, AS are re-operated. Malicious call: operator releases called subscriber. A third operation of key KS again energizes LC and releases LB, DT, ID.

Moreover, the method may include determining a transition boundary along the product-dispensing pass based at least in part on a propagation delay for the prescribed change, where the agricultural implement will cross the transition boundary before the operating parameter boundary.

    A fuel freezing point monitoring device to monitor the freezing point of onboard fuel, especially aircraft fuel. The fuel freezing point monitoring device is capable of monitoring the phase transition or fluidity of the fuel to determine the freezing point of the fuel. The fuel freezing point monitoring device eliminates the freezing point assumption of onboard fuel by actually measuring the freezing point of the fuel. The pilot will have knowledge of the approximate freezing point of the composite onboard fuel and will no longer need to assume a conservative fuel freezing point value. Together with the en-route fuel temperature information provided by existing aircraft sensors, the pilot will have the information to ensure a safe flight and to operate the aircraft efficiently.

Wallace, W. M., and Wallace, C. G. July 20. Paper, treating to imitate textile fabrics.-In machines for imparting a linen appearance to the surface of paper, a short endless band of linen or like fabric is arranged on rollers within an outer and longer endless band, both passing through pressure rolls with the paper between them. Fig. 1 shows the shorter band d arranged within the longer band c, both bands passing round the lower roller a of the pressure rolls a, b. Thus a space is left between the bands for the piles of paper g being fed into and received from the rollers a, b. The paper may be in continuous webs arranged on rolls. Three or more linen bands may be passed round the roll a, in which case two or more webs of paper can be treated simultaneously. Fig. 8 shows a modification in which the linen bands are arranged in duplicate on both rollers a, b and the paper web ,q is passed between the two sets of linen bands. In this case, a better finish is given to the piper since a greater cushioning effect is obtained by having two linen bands on each side of the paper. The paper is finally passed through calendering- rolls, either combined with the above-described machine or in a separate machine.",WALLACE WILLIAM MORGAN;;WALLACE CHARLES GORDON,WALLACE WILLIAM MORGAN;;WALLACE CHARLES GORDON,,https://lens.org/115-366-340-491-333,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Because the mirror does not have a via in the middle connecting to the underlying spring support, there is an improved contrast ratio that results from not having light scatter off the legs or vias like existing technologies. Because there are no supporting contacts, the mirror can be made smaller making smaller pixels that can be used to make higher density displays. In addition, because there is not restoring force from any supporting spring support, the mirror stays in place facing one or other direction due to adhesion. This means there is no need to use a voltage to hold the mirror in position.

Line transmission systems; transistor switching circuits. POST OFFICE. 20 Nov., 1970 [11 Dec., 1969], No. 60496/69. Headings H3T and H4R. A carrier communication system has a pilot signal transmitted as a modulation of a carrier signal to a remote point where an alarm condition is indicated when the level of the pilot signal changes without any change in the level of the carrier signal. Any change in level of the carrier signal is used to inhibit operation of a trigger circuit which normally operates when the pilot signal level changes. Normally the changes in level are cessations of the signals. In the circuit shown, the modulated carrier signal passes through filter 2 to amplifier 3 and rectifier D1 so that the pilot signal modulation passes through R2 to transistor VT1. The alternating component of this signal passes to filter 4, amplifier 5 and diode D3 where a voltage corresponding to the amplitude of the pilot signal is set up across capacitor C6 and is connected to the Schmitt trigger circuit formed by transistors VT4, VT5. An output voltage level indicating the state of the trigger is applied to the base of transistor VT6 and, on disappearance of the pilot signal, an alarm indication is derived from conductor 10. The collector output of transistor VT1 passes to capacitor C2 which absorbs the pilot signal and derives a voltage level proportional to the carrier amplitude independent of the presence of the pilot signal. Changes in this voltage level are amplified in transistors VT2, VT3 and the output of VT3 is used to operate relay 6 to indicate carrier failure. Additionally this output is amplified in transistors VT8, VT9 to operate VT7 as a switch which is closed when the carrier fails thus inhibiting operation of the Schmitt trigger circuit. The levels for operation are determined by the values of resistors chosen.",POST OFFICE,POPE GORDON JOHN;;CHAMBERLAIN IAN CHARLES,,https://lens.org/063-677-608-506-342,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,G08B25/08;;H04J1/16,G08B25/08;;H04J1/16,H3T T1CX          TB1Z;;H3T T1M2P         TB1Z;;H3T T2A1N         TB1Z;;H3T T2A1S         TB1Z;;H3T T2A2          TB1Z;;H3T T2F5          TB1Z;;H3T T2J           TB1Z;;H3T T2T3J         TB1Z;;H3T T3F1          TB1Z;;H3T T3P           TB1Z;;H3T T3X           TB1Z;;H3T T4C           TB1Z;;H3T T4D           TB1Z;;H3T T4E1N         TB1Z;;H3T T4E2N         TB1Z;;H3T T4M           TB1Z;;H3T T4R           TB1Z;;H4R RLRX          RLRX;;H4R R11G          R11;;H4R R18A1         R11,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Gas turbine jet propulsion plant. ROLLS ROYCE Ltd. March 10, 1959 [March 13, 1958], No. 8167/58. Class 110 (3). [Also in Group XXIX] An aircraft gas turbine jet propulsion engine comprising a propelling nozzle with an adjustable member movable into a position in which the effective outlet area is reduced by fluid pressure operated means has control means controlling the supply of pressure fluid to the fluid pressure operated means comprising a differential area piston-in-cylinder arrangement having first and second positions corresponding to actuation of the fluid pressure operated means to move the adjustable member to its maximum and minimum area positions respectively and maintained in its first position by the differential action of the fluid pressure thereon. A jet pipe 11 is provided with a single area-adjusting member 12 pivoted at 13 to a convergent tubular portion 10 of the jet pipe. The member 12 is actuated by piston 16 working in a cylinder 17. The supply of pressure fluid, e.g. compressed air, from the connection 22 to the cylinder 17 is controlled by a valve mechanism 23. The valve mechanism 23 comprises a valve body 24 containing a piston valve 25 having a small diameter land 25a and a pair of axially-spaced large-diameter lands 25b, 25c. When the valve 38 is closed the pressure in the chamber 27 is equal to that in the bore 26 and the piston valve 25 is then at the right-hand end of its travel. In this position, the pressure fluid from the connection 22 is supplied to the left-hand side of the piston 16 through duct 30, space 26 and port 21. The right-hand side of the piston 16 is connected to drain through the port 20, port 34, space 28 and port 35. The piston 16 is therefore urged to the right and the area adjusting member 12 maintained in its maximum area position. When the valve 38 is opened, the chamber 27 is connected to atmosphere through the chamber 37 and port 37a. The restriction 32 then causes the pressure in the chamber 27 to drop and the valve member 25 to move to the left against the stop 29. In this position the left-hand side of the piston 16 is connected to atmosphere through the port 21 and passage 33 and the right-hand side to the connection 22 through the space 26, port 34 and port 20. The piston 16 then moves to the left and the areaadjusting member moved to the reduced area position. The valve member 38 is mounted on a pivoted lever 39 subject at one end to the loading of a spring 41 and at the other to the loading on a diaphragm 51. The diaphragm is subject through the conduits 54, 58 to the pressures from a hydro-mechanical fuel governor of the kind described in Specification 794,897. The loading of the spring 41 is determined by the position of the throttle lever 45 acting through a cam 44, bell-crank 43 and abutment 42. The arrangement is such that at settings of the lever 45 below full throttle or maximum power the loading of the spring 41 is substantially increased so that the loading of the diaphragm 51 is unable to open the valve 38. At full throttle the loading of the spring 41 is reduced and when the engine is running at full speed, the valve 38 is open to close the area reducing member 12. In a modification the spring 41 acts against a fixed abutment and a shut-off valve operated by the throttle 45 is arranged in the passage 38. In another arrangement, in which an engine having variable inlet guide vanes operated by a progressively variable ram supplied with fuel under a pressure related to engine speed, the engine rotational speed signal may be derived from the ram and fed to the lever 39. The control means may be responsive to any other variable which is representative of the power output of the engine, such as compressor delivery pressure.
