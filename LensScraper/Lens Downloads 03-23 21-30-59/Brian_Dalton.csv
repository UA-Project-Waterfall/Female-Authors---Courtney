The alkyl or acyl group may be in the o, m, or p-position to the ether linkage when n is 1, the para isomers being generally preferred. Ar is preferably a benzene nucleus which may be further substituted, e.g. by -CH3 or -OH groups. The alkylene radicals or portions in R1 and R2 may have straight or branched chains and may be substituted by one or more substituents such as chlorine atoms or -OH or -CN groups, provided each alkylene radical or portion does not contain more than 4 carbon atoms. Examples of compounds which may be used are p-tert.-octylphenoxyacetethanolamide (CH3)3.C, CH2, C(CH3)2 C6H4, OCH2, CONH, CH2CH2OH, p-tert.-octylphenoxyacetisopropenolamide, -alpha-propionethanolamide, -alpha-propionisopropanolamide, and -betaacetisopropanolamide, - alpha - propionethanolamide, - alpha-propionisopropanolamide, and - betapropionethanolamide; also p-nonyl-phenoxyacethanolamide and the corresponding meta-decyl, p-n-octyl, p-capryl compounds and 4-caprylyl-3-hydroxyphenoxyacetethanolamide. The ionic soapless detergent may be a sodium salt of a sulphonated alkaryl hydrocarbon e.g. of sulphonated dodecyl toluene, sulphonated dodecyl benzene, or of sulphonated keryl benzene, of a sulphated fatty alcohol or of a secondary alkyl sulphate. A soap may also be present. Diluents or builders, such as sulphates, silicates, carbonates, phosphates or salts of carboxymethylcellulose may be present, in particular phosphates, such as tetrasodiumpyrophosphate or pentasodium tripolyphosphate. In an example the composition contains 21.5 per cent. by weight of the sodium salt of a commercial dodecyl (tetrapropylene polymer) toluene sulphonic acid, 1.5 of p-tert. octylphenoxyacethanolamide, 22.5 of tetrasodium pyrophosphate and 54.5 of other inorganic builders (mainly sodium sulphate with some sodium silicate). In another example the ionic detergent is the sodium salt of a secondary alkyl (C8-C18) sulphuric acid, the other ingredients and their proportions being the same. Dishwashing tests are described using detergent compositions with and without the amides of the invention and with soft water and hard water. With soft water the detergent compositions containing the amides give a more persistent lather than those without.

Measuring thickness electrically. BRITISH IRON & STEEL RESEARCH ASSOCIATION. Sept. 11, 1967 [July 4, 1966], No. 29908/66. Heading G1N. A method of measuring thickness, particularly of a moving sheet leaving a rolling mill, comprises applying a frequency modulated micro-wave beam to a pair of cavity resonators tunable by the sheet and disposed one on either side thereof; determining the frequency at which each resonator resonates, and calculating the thickness of the sheet from the determined resonant frequencies and the known distance between the resonators. - Thus movement of the strip up and down between the resonators will not affect the calculated thickness. The resonant frequencies may be determined by the change in amplitude of signals from the cavity Figs. 1, 2 (not shown) or phase change at resonance Fig. 3 (not shown). In Fig. 1 the amplitude change is used to lock frequency meters driven from the sweep-frequency-modulator. In Fig. 2 the rampvoltage-generator for the frequency-sweep-modulator provides a frequency-representative signal which is gated to an arithmetic unit by AND circuits at a pre-set signal level from the resonators. In Fig. 3 the AND gates are triggered by a phasemeter.",BRITISH IRON STEEL RESEARCH,WILLIAMS ROYSON VAUGHAN;;DALTON BRIAN LEONARD,,https://lens.org/020-585-792-678-305,Granted Patent,no,0,7,1,1,0,G01B15/02,G01B15/02,G1N NCTR          CTR;;G1N N19B1B        CTR;;G1N N19B2A        CTR;;G1N N19C7         CTR;;G1N N19D1A        CTR;;G1N N19D12R       CTR;;G1N N19F7D2       CTR;;G1N N19H7A        CTR;;G1N N19H7B2       CTR,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Types of calls include voice, fax, video, etc. The routing engine provides significant flexibility to the gateways by allowing the gateways to designate preferences that define operational limits or requirements. A source gateway operator may set preferences such as the maximum price that is willing to be paid for a call, the maximum delay that will be tolerated and the maximum autonomous system hop count that will be tolerated. A destination gateway operator is likely only to be concerned with setting price schedules as preferences. Gateway operators may also set 'preference criteria', which define the circumstances in which a certain set of preferences is to be applied. Based on preferences and preference criteria, the routing engine is able to locate destination gateways that are eligible to terminate a voice over telephony IP call. The routing engine provides a prioritized list of eligible destination gateways to the source gateway. The source gateway then works through the prioritized list and attempts to set up the voice over IP telephony call with each eligible destination gateway, until the call is established.","TRANSNEXUS, LLC","DALTON, James, Pleasant, Gossett, Jr.;;DALTON, Alcina, de Figueiredo;;THOMAS, Stephen, Anthony;;COWN, Maria, Osterholt;;VAUGHN, Rich, Carroll;;SZCZERBINA, Pawel;;LOVETTE, Brian, Keith",,https://lens.org/049-582-270-245-392,Search Report,yes,0,0,2,2,0,,H04L12/64;;H04L25/06;;H04L29/06;;H04M7/00;;H04M15/00,,0,0,,,,UNKNOWN

SOLUTION: Resetting a sensor before a sampling operation eliminates the error due to the dark current and a counter related to the light source is provided to calculate a geometrical center of the light quantities from the light source by using the information from the counter so as to make sampling at a proper point of time in the case that moving speeds of a plurality of sensors are changed in this invention.",HEWLETT PACKARD CO,KOCHIS RICHARD L;;DALTON DAN L;;MOSS ROBERT W;;HASTINGS BRIAN L;;OLIVER THOMAS C,,https://lens.org/000-482-850-038-430,Patent Application,no,0,2,8,8,0,H04N1/047;;H04N1/107;;H04N1/047;;H04N1/107,H04N1/047;;G06T1/00;;H04N1/107,,0,0,,,,PENDING

   A metal plus low dielectric constant (low-k) interconnect structure is provided for a semiconductor device wherein adjacent regions in a surface separated by a dielectric have dimensions in width and spacing in the sub 250 nanometer range, and in which reduced lateral leakage current between adjacent metal lines, and a lower effective dielectric constant than a conventional structure, is achieved by the positioning of a differentiating or mask member that is applied for the protection of the dielectric in subsequent processing operations, at a position about 2-5 nanometers below a, to be planarized, surface where there will be a lower electric field. The invention is particularly useful in the damascene type device structure in the art wherein adjacent conductors extend from a substrate through an interlevel dielectric material, connections are made in a trench, a diffusion barrier liner is provided in the interlevel dilectric material and masking is employed to protect the dilectric material between conductors during processing operations.

    A metal plus low dielectric constant (low-k) interconnect structure is provided for a semiconductor device wherein adjacent regions in a surface separated by a dielectric have dimensions in width and spacing in the sub 250 nanometer range, and in which reduced lateral leakage current between adjacent metal lines, and a lower effective dielectric constant than a conventional structure, is achieved by the positioning of a differentiating or mask member that is applied for the protection of the dielectric in subsequent processing operations, at a position about 2-5 nanometers below a, to be planarized, surface where there will be a lower electric field. The invention is particularly useful in the damascene type device structure in the art wherein adjacent conductors extend from a substrate through an interlevel dielectric material, connections are made in a trench, a diffusion barrier liner is provided in the interlevel dielectric material and masking is employed to protect the dielectric material between conductors during processing operations.
