   The present invention involves providing in a computer a first set of object classes representing active entities in an information-handling process, wherein a limited number of privacy-related actions represent operations performed on data, and providing in the computer a second set of object classes representing data and rules in the information-handling process, wherein at least one object class has rules associated with data. The invention also involves using the above-mentioned objects in constructing a model of an information-handling process, and providing output that identifies at least one way in which the information-handling process could be improved.
