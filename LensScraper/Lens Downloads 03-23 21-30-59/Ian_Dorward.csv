The system receives an identity verification for a user of a review engine, then assigns a unique pseudonymous identity to the user. The system receives an identity verification for a provider on the review engine. The system then generates an aNFT that is unique to the provider. The aNFT includes one or more value attributes which correspond to at least authenticating the user within the review engine. Next, the system generates a review-in-progress to be displayed on the user client device. The system then receives a completed review from the user client device, and records hashed data associated with the completed review into a transaction record on a public blockchain network, such that the transaction record can be publicly audited on the public blockchain network.",LUCID RATINGS INC,DORWARD IAN GORDON ASHLEY,,https://lens.org/193-455-905-873-851,Patent Application,yes,0,3,1,1,0,G06Q20/3674;;G06Q20/389;;G06Q20/4014;;G06Q20/0655;;G06Q20/3674;;G06Q20/389;;G06Q20/3672,G06Q20/38;;G06Q20/36,,0,0,,,,PENDING
