The assistance device can be magnetically attached to corresponding magnetic connection elements at the shoulders of a jacket. As the jacket is placed over one shoulder, the other end of the assistance device (and attached portions of the jacket) will tend to be biased toward the other side of the user. This makes it easier for users to grab the other side of the jacket since it extends toward the arm not in the jacket sleeve reducing the distance that the user needs to move this arm behind their back to grab the jacket.

   A novel solution to fast network restoration is provided. In a network node, dedicated hardware elements are utilized to implement restoration, and these elements are linked via a specialized high speed bus. Moreover, the incoming and outgoing optical signals to each input/output port are continually monitored and their status communicated to such dedicated hardware via the high-speed bus. This provides a complete snapshot in virtually real time of the state of each input port on the node, and the switch map specifying the inter portal connections, to the dedicated control and restoration hardware. The specialized hardware detects trouble conditions and reconfigures the switching fabric. The invention enables a very fast and efficient control loop between the I/O ports, switch fabrics, and controllers. 

   In a preferred embodiment the hardware comprises a Connection Manager and an Equipment Manager. The switching fabric control is also linked via the same high-speed bus, making changes to input/output port assignments possible in less than a millisecond and thus reducing the overall restoration time. In a preferred embodiment the status information is continually updated every 125 microseconds or less, and the switch fabric can be reconfigured in no more than 250 microseconds from occurrence of a trouble condition.

   In a maintenance system for a switch fabric in an optical switching network, a test signal is generated and multiplexed with the incoming traffic signal to form a composite signal. The composite signal is transmitted through the switch fabric via the traffic channel and then demultiplexed back into the traffic signal and the test signal, both of which are monitored by one or optical performance monitors. Thus, if the traffic signal is found to be defective, it is easy to determine whether the cause is the switch fabric or the incoming optical traffic signal that was already bad before entering the switch fabric.

   The present invention provides an optical signal quality selection system for optimizing the quality of information transmission. The system splits an incoming optical signal into two equal signals. The split signals are evaluated in optical performance monitors, transmitting an electrical output message to a signal selector relating to the quality of the respective signal. A second electrical message is sent from the optical performance generator to an alarm indicator signal generator, which sends an optical signal to the signal selector to drop the one of the split signals and transmit the non-dropped split signal. An unequipped optical signal from an optical idle signal generator is triggered if no active optical signal is being transmitted.
