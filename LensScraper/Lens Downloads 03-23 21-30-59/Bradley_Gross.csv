   A dual warmth comforter includes first and second sections joined together by a fastening device. The first section includes first and second fabric sheets and a first insulation material disposed between the first and second fabric sheets. The second section includes third and fourth fabric sheets and a second insulation material disposed between the third and fourth fabric sheets. The first section has a first thermal resistance that is greater than the thermal resistance of the second section. The different thermal resistances can be achieved by using different insulation fill weights, insulation materials with different thermal conductivities, or some combination thereof. The fastening device can be hook-and-loop type fasteners, a zipper, buttons, snaps, laces and the like.

The teeth statistical model can jointly describe shape and pose variations per tooth, and as well as placement of the individual teeth in the teeth row. In some embodiments, the teeth statistic model can be trained using teeth information from 3D scan data of different sample subjects. The 3D scan data can be used to establish a database of teeth of various shapes and poses. Geometry information regarding the individual teeth can be extracted from the 3D scan data. The teeth statistic model can be trained using the geometry information regarding the individual teeth.",DISNEY ENTPR INC;;ETH ZUERICH EIDGENOESSISCHE TECHNISCHE HOCHSCHULE ZUERICH,WU CHENGLEI;;BRADLEY DEREK;;BEELER THABO;;GROSS MARKUS,DISNEY ENTERPRISES INC (2016-10-26);;ETH ZÜRICH (EIDGENÖSSISCHE TECHNISCHE HOCHSCHULE ZÜRICH) (2016-09-28);;THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY (SWITZERLAND) GMBH (2016-09-28),https://lens.org/186-296-392-625-510,Granted Patent,yes,10,1,2,2,0,A61C13/0004;;G16H70/20;;G16H70/60;;A61D5/00;;G16H50/50;;G06N20/00;;A61D5/00;;G16H50/50;;G06N20/00;;A61C13/0004;;G16H70/20;;G16H70/60,G16H50/50;;A61C13/00;;A61D5/00;;G06N20/00;;G16H70/20;;G16H70/60,,50,42,034-930-190-961-448;;025-078-098-678-220;;051-128-823-231-954;;010-286-268-996-62X;;108-864-768-845-938;;084-554-207-720-382;;084-944-111-772-974;;090-548-709-582-617;;020-005-696-666-060;;036-815-962-668-583;;076-502-154-538-522;;063-093-888-426-726;;045-818-343-596-947;;020-193-026-052-423;;063-701-976-969-225;;099-018-557-659-011;;086-854-847-655-248;;085-437-695-981-146;;003-366-555-089-471;;036-934-942-017-734;;120-604-114-495-960;;170-789-426-128-569;;152-259-283-684-152;;000-942-970-202-842;;061-079-318-275-184;;008-370-919-638-448;;066-172-707-326-609;;013-727-957-755-59X;;023-542-815-441-167;;097-176-291-064-125;;014-095-199-075-432;;076-887-835-214-419;;000-271-827-493-654;;107-641-459-406-822;;054-508-048-130-047;;173-875-051-173-370;;027-445-726-345-502;;071-087-840-287-236;;103-087-259-160-003;;049-063-538-561-915;;101-273-756-594-60X;;002-881-641-838-109,10.1145/1667239.1667251;;10.1145/2185520.2185613;;10.1145/1964921.1964970;;10.1145/1833349.1778777;;10.1145/2766924;;10.1145/311535.311556;;10.1109/tdpvt.2004.1335212;;17336957;;10.1016/j.compbiomed.2007.01.003;;10.1145/2601097.2601204;;10.1145/2766943;;10.1109/cvpr.2006.298;;10.1145/2601097.2601133;;10.1109/cvpr.2007.383189;;10.1007/978-3-642-36620-8_26;;10.1109/cvpr.2014.537;;10.1111/cgf.12552;;10.1145/2508363.2508380;;10.1145/2070781.2024163;;10.1109/tip.2002.804262;;18249688;;10.1145/2766931;;10.1145/2766974;;10.2197/ipsjjip.22.401;;10.1145/2783258.2783356;;10.1007/978-3-642-04271-3_117;;20426205;;16048526;;10.1111/j.1600-0722.2005.00224.x;;10.1016/j.prosdent.2006.02.016;;10.1109/icip.2014.7025870;;10.1109/isbi.2007.357104;;10.1145/2766894;;10.1109/icwapr.2007.4420700;;10.1002/0471725382;;10.1145/2661229.2661290;;10.1145/1057432.1057456;;10.1007/978-3-319-10593-2_52;;10.1109/iccv.2015.450;;10.1145/2816795.2818056;;10.1145/2366145.2366206;;10.1016/0004-3702(82)90023-6;;10.1145/1179352.1141987;;pmc4141676;;24786137;;10.1259/dmfr.20140080;;10.1016/j.cad.2010.11.003;;10.1145/2601097.2601165,"Abdelmunim et al., “A 3d human teeth database construction based on a point based shape registration”, In IEEE ICIP, 2011, 1617-1620.;;Alexander et al., “Creating a real-time photoreal digital actor”, In ACM SIGGRAPH 2013 Posters, 2013, 1:1-1:1.;;Alexander et al., “The digital emily project: Photo-real facial modeling and animation”, In ACM SIGGRAPH 2009 Courses, 2009, 2:1-12:15.;;Bérard et al., “High-quality capture of eyes”, ACM Tran781s.

The intelligence regarding the specific rules for making the conversion are encapsulated in a policy class, which governs how the path of exchange rates contained in the compound exchange rate is built. When a client requests conversion between two currencies, the compound exchange rate is constructed according to the policy to contain a path of exchange rate objects that may be used to make the requested conversion, and the compound exchange rate is then returned to the client. When the client then instructs the compound exchange rate to make a conversion of a known currency value in the source currency, the compound exchange rate object uses the exchange rate object or objects in the exchange rate path to perform the currency conversion.

For example, shape and material properties are defined for a plurality of sample configurations of the animation rig. The shape and material properties are associated with the plurality of sample configurations. An animation of the animation rig is obtained, and one or more configurations of the animation rig are determined for one or more frames of the animation.

Tracking is performed in image space and uses an integrated result to propagate a single reference mesh to performances represented in the image space. Image-space tracking is computed for each camera in multi-camera setups. Thus, multiple hypotheses can be propagated forward in time. If one flow computation develops inaccuracies, the others can compensate. This yields results superior to mesh-based tracking techniques because image data typically contains much more detail, facilitating more accurate tracking. Moreover, the problem of error propagation due to inaccurate tracking in image space can be dealt with in the same domain in which it occurs. Therefore, there is less complication of distortion due to parameterization, a technique used frequently in mesh processing algorithms.",BEELER THABO;;BICKEL BERND;;HAHN FABIAN;;BRADLEY DEREK;;BEARDSLEY PAUL;;SUMNER BOB;;GROSS MARKUS;;DISNEY ENTPR INC,BEELER THABO;;BICKEL BERND;;HAHN FABIAN;;BRADLEY DEREK;;BEARDSLEY PAUL;;SUMNER BOB;;GROSS MARKUS,DISNEY ENTERPRISES INC (2011-11-07);;ETH ZURICH (EIDGENOESSISCHE TECHNISCHE HOCHSCHULE ZURICH) (2011-10-25);;THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY (SWITZERLAND) GMBH (2011-11-01),https://lens.org/099-010-723-078-997,Granted Patent,yes,5,52,1,1,0,G06T19/20;;G06T2219/2021;;G06T2207/10021;;G06T2207/20016;;G06T2207/30201;;G06T7/246;;G06V40/173;;G06V10/44;;G06V10/507;;G06V10/751;;G06T17/00;;G06T2219/2021;;G06T19/20;;G06T2207/20016;;G06T2207/10021;;G06T2207/30201;;G06T7/246;;G06V10/44;;G06V10/507;;G06V10/751;;G06V40/173,G06T17/00;;G06V10/44,382/154,26,20,064-850-690-972-90X;;034-930-190-961-448;;010-286-268-996-62X;;129-001-518-363-491;;132-414-886-064-560;;064-850-690-972-90X;;021-003-896-586-96X;;066-403-194-716-657;;026-555-661-228-209;;040-535-415-367-691;;027-335-589-706-019;;013-686-278-304-473;;072-451-869-200-426;;020-295-933-832-519;;038-506-573-003-83X;;006-732-578-216-628;;004-180-450-547-289;;053-148-176-795-577;;114-866-102-007-600;;141-071-255-148-316,10.1145/1833349.1778778;;10.1145/1667239.1667251;;10.1145/1833349.1778777;;10.1145/1239451.1239484;;10.1111/1467-8659.t01-1-00712;;10.1145/1833349.1778778;;10.1109/cvpr.1996.517079;;10.1109/ca.1996.540489;;10.1109/cvpr.2009.5206868;;10.1145/1015706.1015811;;10.1109/34.216724;;10.1007/s00371-005-0291-5;;10.1109/iccv.1999.791210;;10.1145/1399504.1360616;;10.1145/1015706.1015736;;10.1145/1516522.1516526;;10.1111/j.1467-8659.2004.00800.x;;10.1145/97880.97906;;10.1007/s00371-008-0259-3;;10.1145/1015706.1015759,"High Resolution Passive Facial Performance Capture.
