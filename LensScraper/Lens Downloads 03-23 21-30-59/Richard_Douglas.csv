A toroidal container for a gas-discharge apparatus has a liner provided with a plurality of apertures defining zig-zag current paths around its large circumference, each of which paths has a resistance which is high relative to that of the discharge but so arranged that resultant current flow round the small circumference is negligible. In one arrangement, Fig. 1, the liner is provided with rows of slots which are staggered to provide zig-zag current paths which are shown dotted. In another arrangement, Fig. 2, the slots are V-shaped. In a modification, Fig. 3 (not shown), the width of the slots varies, being greatest at the apices of the V's. In a further modification, Fig. 4 (not shown), there are two liners as in Fig. 2, one inside the other, and the slots in the two liners are staggered with respect to each other. The use of two liners reduces bombardment of the outer wall by X-rays and charged particles emanating from the discharge. The provision of slots enables the resistance of the liner to be increased by a factor of 50.

Change-giving apparatus.-Apparatus for giving change for Treasury and like notes comprises means for pulling the note through a pair of rollers so arranged that their rotational movement is governed by the length of the note and actuates means for unlocking the drawer of the changecontaining receptacle. Three forms of apparatus are described. (1) The first, Figs. 3 and 5, comprises a casing provided with windows 7, 7x horizontally slotted to receive a one-pound note and a ten-shilling note respectively, external ledges 13 and internal guides 37 being also furnished. Opposite each note slot are two pairs of rubber rollers 29, 30 and 32, 33, in circumference respectively equal to one-half and the full length of the note, and urged together by springs. The rollers 29, 30 are geared together and to wheels 40 on shafts 41, each provided with a pawl 42, by wheels 38, 39, and the rollers 32, 33 may also be geared together. A driving chain 64 couples the rollers 33 and the lower one is driven by a handle 62 on its shaft 35. The shafts 28 of the rollers 30 are each provided with a spring-pressed clutch element 50 adapted to be engaged by a hand-wheel 45, the movement of which is limited by stops 67 and resisted by a spring 56. A note is fed through its appropriate slot to a pair of rollers 32, 33 by turning the hand-wheel 45 of the corresponding rollers 29, 30. The handle 62 is then turned to actuate the rollers 32, 33 which pull the note through the rollers 29, 30, causing these to rotate further and, through the gearing 38, 40, to swing the pawl 42 round to strike a projection 58 on the spring-resisted bar 21 which is moved upwards out of locking engagement with the drawer 10. The clutch 50 is disengaged and the handle 45 returns to its initial position. If a ten-shilling note is inserted in the one-pound slot its length is insufficient to produce the necessary movement of the drawer-unlocking mechanism. The notes are removed through a door in the front of the apparatus, and side doors 14 give access to the tubes 15 containing the change-containing receptacles 18 The change drawers 10, 10<x>, respectively for giving change for a one-pound and ten-shilling note, are each outwardly urged by a spring and provided with side ledges 17 for removing the lowermost change-container 18, and counter tapes for indicating the number of times each drawer has been operated and a bell 23 are also fitted. The rollers 32, 33 may be replaced by clips, &c. for drawing the note through the rollers 29, 30. (2) In the apparatus shown in Fig. 7, three pairs of rubber rollers 29, 30 - - 72, 73 - - 76. 77 are mounted behind each note slot, the rollers 72, 76 of both sets being carried by plates 78 coupled by rods 80 and normally retained in the uppermost position by springs 86 connected to levers 84 pivoted at 85 and coupled by pins 83 to the rods 80. Cams 107 on a driving shaft 90 co-act with rollers 108 on the levers 84 to depress the rollers 72, 76 once in each revolution, and spur-wheels 94, 95 actuate the rollers 30, 77 through intermediate wheels 96, 100. The spindles of the rollers 73 carry spring-resisted arms 104 for engaging the drawer-locking bars 21. and cams 109 actuate through levers 110 a shutter 68 which is provided near its upper end with a slot and prevents the insertion of a note unless the apparatus is in its initial position. In operation, the note is passed through the appropriate slot, either beneath the lower end of the shutter or through the slot near its upper end, and the shaft 90 is turned. The initial movement releases the levers 110 and causes the shutter to close the note slots; the note is gripped by the rollers 29, 30 and drawn through the space between the plate 68 and the casing 1, and fed between the three pairs of rollers during the first seven-eights of the revolution of the shaft 90; during the remaining eighth the cams 107 force the rollers 72, 73 - - 76, 77 together, and the note is pulled by the rollers 76, 77 through the rollers 72, 73 which are thus revolved and actuate the arms 104 to release the appropriate change drawer. As the rollers opposite the slot for the one-pound notes are of greater diameter than those opposite that for the ten-shilling notes, should a tenshilling note be inserted in the one-pound slot, it will be passed through the rollers 72, 73 before the arms 104 reach the drawer-releasing rod. The rollers 29, 30 may be circumferentially corrugated to ensure the straight feeding forward of the note. Each operation of the machine may be effected by a half or full turn of the shaft 90. and in the latter case. the shaft handle is limited in movement by a sliding stop and is returned by a spring to its initial position after operating the shaft through a pawl and ratchet. (3) In the form shown in Figs. 9 and 10, the apparatus comprises two pairs of rollers 29, 30 fixed on shafts 27, 28, and between them, rollers 72, 73 secured on sleeves 27A, 28<A> loosely mounted on the shafts. These rollers have a circumference equal in length to the notes, and the shafts 27 are driven by gearing from a main shaft 90 provided with cams 109 for operating a shutter 68 through levers 110. When a note is inserted, it is gripped by the fast rollers 29, 30 and being pulled between the rollers 72, 73, it causes these to rotate. A cam 117 on the roller sleeve 27<A> then raises a spring-resisted arm 118 on a spindle 119 and causes an arm 104 on the spindle to operate the drawer-releasing rod 21, The loose rollers 72, 73 may be returned to their original positions against a stop by a spring. According to the Provisional Specification, an endless band or sliding shutter provided with clips draws all notes through one pair of rollers, the number of revolutions of which, being dependent on the length of the note inserted, determines which change drawer is released; an apparatus like that shown in Figs. 3 and 5 may similarly act with one set of rollers. Also, the machine may be arranged to exhibit the notes behind glass after they pass into it.",BAILEY RICHARD DOUGLAS,BAILEY RICHARD DOUGLAS,,https://lens.org/116-992-119-020-852,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G07D1/02,G07D1/02,G4V VAL           VAL;;G4V V101          VAL;;G4V V105          VAL;;U1S S2417,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    An integrated-cycle power system and method, comprising thermal transfer assembly, recuperating heat exchanger assembly, heat integrator, thermal conduit assembly and gas turbine. The thermal transfer assembly receives heat emitted from the effluent of a heat source, wherein the heat is preferably in the form of high temperature gas. Within the thermal transfer assembly, the energy of the high temperature gas is transferred to a conductive medium carried within a thermal conduit assembly. Due to a thermal potential between the augmenting heat source effluent and the heat integrator, the augmenting heat-source energy is transferred to the heat integrator, wherein energy from a novel recuperating heat exchange assembly is integrated therewith and introduced into the combustion chamber of a gas turbine. The recuperating heat exchanger assembly receives exhaust heat from the gas turbine and recuperates this energy via the heat integrator back into the combustion chamber of the gas turbine.

O. SMITH CORP. 30 May, 1967, No. 24883/67. Headings B2F and B2L. [Also in Division F2] Apparatus for coating the interior of pipes comprises a cantilevered boom arm supported against axial movement, airless spray applicator means rotatably mounted at the end of the arm, a non-rotatable liquid coating material line extending substantially axially of the arm, a rotary high pressure coupling the line to the applicator means, and a constanttorque hydraulic motor mounted on the arm adjacent the applicator means and coupled to rotate the latter. A boom arm 2 carries at one end a rotary spray head 1, is pivotally supported at its other end on a pedestal 3, and is normally supported by a roller 156 adapted to be raised and lowered by a jack 159. A pipe 7, to be spray-painted internally, is supported by rollers 11 journalled in pedestals 10 and driven by chains 19, the pipe being initially moved, while the spray means is inoperative, from an extreme left hand position through a spray booth 5 to the extreme right hand position shown. During said movement the pipe, while telescoping over arm 2, actuates a switch 163 to effect operation of jack 159 for lowering roller 156. The interior of the pipe is engaged by vertical stabilising rollers 125 and horizontal stabilising rollers 127 mounted on arm 2. Head 1 comprises a plurality of radiallydirected spray guns 22 mounted on a body 20 detachably secured to the end of a shaft 21 journalled in a housing 58 projecting axially from a housing 60 at the end of arm 2. A conical baffle 73, rigid with housing 58, carries an upwardly-directed spray gun 74 for coating a longitudinal weld in pipe 7. Each spray gun 22 comprises a barrel 24 provided at respective ends with a spray nozzle 26 and a liquid-supplying nipple 34, and containing a spring-closed valve needle 27. A pivoted arm 29, engaging the latter is linked by a rod 30 to a diaphragm 31 in a chamber 32, supply of compressed air to which, via a nipple 33, serves to unseat needle 27 to operate the spray gun. The nipples 34 are connected by radial passages to an axial bore 41 in body 20 and shaft 21, said bore being connected via rotary coupling 99 to a liquid pressure line disposed axially in arm 2. Nipples 33 are connected by axial passages in body 20 and shaft 21 to a circumferential groove in shaft 21, said groove being closed by a fixed annular member communicating via a solenoid valve 66 with an air pressure line disposed axially in arm 2. Coupling 99 comprises a fixed hollow body 104 closed by an end plate 106 and journalling a hollow spindle 101 on roller bearings 107, 109. Spindle 101 is connected at one end to bore 41 and at the other end via a passage 105 in body 104 to the liquid supply line 98. A liquid seal, mounted between body 104 and a reduced end portion of spindle 101, comprises end rings 115, 116 and a plurality of intermediate rings 113 made from glass-reinforced plastics and of the crosssections shown, the intermediate packings 114 being chamfered to provide clearances at the inner faces of the rings 113. Leakage from the seal is drained via a passage 119 in body 104 and a pipe 120. Shaft 21 is rotated via gearing from a constant-torque hydraulic motor mounted in housing 60. The spray guns are surrounded by a hollow cylinder 6 mounted on rollers 168, 169 and rotated via gearing 166 from a motor 167. To commence a painting operation, the hydraulic motor is energised to rotate head 1, and valve 66 is energised to operate the spray guns 22 and 74, the paint being caught by cylinder 6 and being deflected therefrom by scraper blades 173 into receptacles 172. The rollers 11 are then driven to move pipe 7 leftwards. When the right hand end of pipe 7 clears switch 163, roller 156 rises to engage a block 154 rigid with arm 2. Should roller 156 fail to rise, an abutment associated with to rollers 125 would engage a fixed and vertically-adjustable platform 144. The paint, which is normally of the epoxy resin type, is supplied at a pressure of from 2200 to 2400 lbs. per square inch, and the spray nozzles are positioned at a distance of from 6¢ to 7¢ inches from the interior surface of pipe 7.",SMITH CORP A O,HORTVET DOUGLAS RICHARD,,https://lens.org/065-803-636-179-139,Granted Patent,no,0,10,1,1,0,B05B13/0636;;E05Y2900/402,B05B13/06;;B08B9/045,B2F F10F1EY       17;;B2F F10F1X        17;;B2F F10F2DY       17;;B2F F10F2D1       17;;B2F F2R           17;;B2L LA            LA10;;B2L L104          LA10;;B2L L133          LA10;;B2L L26H2A5       L26H;;B2L L26H2B2       L26H;;B2L L26H2C5       L26H;;B2L L26H2E        L26H;;B2L L26H2F        L26H;;B2L L301          LA10;;F2B B13A6         -;;F2B B13B2B        -;;F2B B13B3A7B1     -;;F2B B13B3E1       -;;F2B B13D          -;;F2G G35           G6C1;;F2G G6C1          G6C1,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Jan. 15, 1958 [Sept. 26, 1957], No. 30277/57. Class 86 [Also in Groups XXX and XXXI]. A concrete or like mixer comprises a self-propelled dirigible wheeled chassis 2, 3, 4, Fig. 2, carrying a rotary mixer drum 7, Fig. 3, and a skip 16 for loading the drum, means e.g. a clutch 32 having a control lever 31, connecting the power unit (under a bonnet 1) of the chassis to the drum, means 10, 12 for tilting the drum for loading or unloading and means 17, 18, 19 and 20 for positioning the skips in! a position to scoopup material to be mixed or a position for discharging the material into the drum. The front wheels 21 are driven from the power unit via a clutch and change speed gear (not shown) a shaft 39, differential 38, axle shafts 35, sprockets 34 and chains 33, the wheels 21 being carried by stub axles fixed to side plates 2a at the ends of the front beam 2. The rear wheels 22 are steerable on the rear axle bar 4 pivotably conected at 4a to a wide V-shapped frame' secured to the main chassis tubes 3 which are secured to front beam 2. The power unit can rotate the drum 7 through the clutch 32, reduction gear 30 and a shaft 13 provided at its ends with universal joints 41, 42. The joint 41 is connected to a spigot 40 within a drum recess 43. The drum 7 is provided with a channelled ring 7a engageable by rollers 8a carried in a ring frame 8 having trunnions received in bearings 9 secured to the upper ends of a pair of arms 9a pivoted at 9b to the side plates 2a. The arms 9a are pivotably connected at 15a to the ends of a V-shaped yoke 15 having an apical plunger 15b engaging a tube 14 of a stabilizer. Secured to the trunnions at each side are cranks 12 one of which is secured to a manually operable lever 10. The cranks 12 are engageable with stops 11 on the plates 2a to determine the loading position of the drum as shown in Fig. 3, and its unloading position. The arrangement of the pivoted arms 9a renders the use of a telescopic shaft 13 unnecessary. The lever 10 is retainable by a hook 10a. The skip 16 is secured to a U-shaped frame 17 having cranked portions secured to a shaft 18 rotatable in bearings 36 Fig. 2, carried by brackets 37 on the frame tubes 3. Secured to the shaft 18 is a lever 19 conected to the piston rod 20b of a piston movable in a hydraulic cylinder 20 under the control of a reversing valve 27 connected to the cylinder and a pump driven from the power-unit by piping 27a. The cylinder 20 is pivoted at 20a to an anchorage. The valve 27 is arranged so that the skip can be raised beyond the position shown in Fig. 3 and below the scooping position in line with the wheel base. In the latter case the skip may be used to jack-up the front wheels out of soft ground. The valve may be operated to shake the skip to loosen material adhering thereto.

   An integrated-cycle power system and method, comprising thermal transfer assembly, recuperating heat exchanger assembly, heat integrator, thermal conduit assembly and gas turbine. The thermal transfer assembly receives heat emitted from the effluent of a heat source, wherein the heat is preferably in the form of high temperature gas. Within the thermal transfer assembly, the energy of the high temperature gas is transferred to a conductive medium carried within a thermal conduit assembly. Due to a thermal potential between the augmenting heat source effluent and the heat integrator, the augmenting heat-source energy is transferred to the heat integrator, wherein energy from a novel recuperating heat exchange assembly is integrated therewith and introduced into the combustion chamber of a gas turbine. The recuperating heat exchanger assembly receives exhaust heat from the gas turbine and recuperates this energy via the heat integrator back into the combustion chamber of the gas turbine.

Ltd. July 19, 1962, No. 27891/62. Heading B3E. A folding brake comprises a pair of forming members mounted for pivotal movement in opposed directions about a common axis from a first or rest position in which the upper surfaces of the forming members are coplanar to a second or folding position in which the said upper surfaces are inclined to one another, a hold-down ram located above the said axis and movable into contact with a sheet metal or other workpiece laid across the upper surfaces of the forming members in their first position to provide a stationary fold guide during the folding operation, means attached to one of the forming members for pivotal movement thereof and link means connecting the two members so that pivotal movement of one member in one direction automatically effects pivotal movement of the other member in the opposed direction. A metal sheet 32 to be bent is placed across coplanar upper surfaces 33 of counterweighted pivotable forming members 8, 9. A hold down ram 13 is then lowered to clamp the sheet 32 in position. This is effected by rocking a handle 18 secured to a shaft 19 carrying a plate 21 with an eccentric pin 23 thereon connected by an adjustable link 27 to an extension 25 of a pressure bar 12 carrying the ram 13. The members 8, 9 are swung up about a common axis to bend up the sheet to the desired angle about opposite sides of the ram 13, the angle being determined by the position of stop units 47 on bolts 45 carried by brackets 44 on the member 8. The swinging of the members 8, 9 is effected by handles 48, or piston and cylinder means 55, 56, Fig. 7, secured to the member 8, the members 8, 9 being interconnected by adjustable link means 49, 50, 51 so that they swing in opposite directions. The upper surfaces 33 of the members 8, 9 are adjustable relatively to the bodies of these members to vary the distance between such surfaces and the common pivot axis of the members 8, 9 so that the members may follow the contour of a ram with a lower rounded edge during the bending operation.",KEETON SONS,PEARCE RICHARD DOUGLAS,,https://lens.org/066-045-285-859-453,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B21D5/042,B21D5/04,B3E ECF           ECF;;B3E E1C           ECF;;B3E E1EX          ECF;;B3E E1Y           ECF;;B3E E10D1         ECF;;B3E E10D3         ECF;;B3E E14G          ECF,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   An integrated-cycle power system and method, comprising thermal transfer assembly, recuperating heat exchanger assembly, heat integrator, thermal conduit assembly and gas turbine. The thermal transfer assembly receives heat emitted from the effluent of a heat source, wherein the heat is preferably in the form of high temperature gas. Within the thermal transfer assembly, the energy of the high temperature gas is transferred to a conductive medium carried within a thermal conduit assembly. Due to a thermal potential between the augmenting heat source effluent and the heat integrator, the augmenting heat-source energy is transferred to the heat integrator, wherein energy from a novel recuperating heat exchange assembly is integrated therewith and introduced into the combustion chamber of a gas turbine. The recuperating heat exchanger assembly receives exhaust heat from the gas turbine and recuperates this energy via the heat integrator back into the combustion chamber of the gas turbine.

Feb. 18, 1964 [Feb. 28, 1963], No. 8094/63. Heading B3E. In a folding brake of the kind described in Specification 957,853 having a pair of forming members 7, 8, Fig. 3, pivoted about a common axis 11, Fig. 5, and operated in unison to fold a sheet metal or like workpiece 22 about a hold down ram 21, the members 7, 8 are connected by links 10, 41, to a common actuating member 44 which is movable towards and away from the pivot axis to effect pivotal movement of the forming members. The latter are adjustably mounted in slideways on trunnions 10 pivoted on fixed pins; height setting of the members is effected by adjustment screws 18, Fig. 2. Member. 44 comprises a cross beam connected at each end by links 51 to an hydraulic ram 45. The rams 45 are supplied by a motor driven pump 54, Fig. 1 (not shown), through a control valve 56 closable by a handle 57 and having a catch 58 which can be tripped to open the valve by a collar 59 or rod 60 connected to one of the rams. Collar 59 is adjustable against a scale 63, Fig. 2, and when it opens the valve 56 pressure is released from the rams and the members 7, 8 are returned by gravity. Hold down ram 21, Figs. 2, 3, comprises separate carbon-steel blades 35 mounted in a cross bar 34 actuated by an hydraulic system or preferably by lead screws 25 driven through chain drives by an electric motor 28, Fig. 1 (not shown), fitted with a magnetic brake. The motor is stopped automatically by a rod 30 actuating upper and lower limit switches 32, 33. Work setting brackets 39 are mounted on either of the forming members. The hold down ram may be a cylindrical mandrel attached by a flange to the cross bar 34.

The means of dispense is a manually operated hand pump 15, comprising a piston 12 slidable in a chamber 15. The liquid is recycled through the chamber 15 of the hand pump by recirculating pump 5. It enters port 16, flows through an annulus in the piston 12 and exits through port 17. When it is required to dispense liquid through the dispense outlet 9, a piston rod 18 moves a piston valve 13 to seat against the piston 12, which prevents recirculation of liquid through the annulus in the piston 12. Movement of the sealed piston 12 in the direction shown in fig. 3 lifts the valve 10 from its seat and forces liquid into chamber 8 and out of outlet 9. Thus operation of the hand pump 15 overrides the recirculation pump 5. If required, the liquid can be dispensed at a predetermined temperature or condition. A sensor 3 downstream of the recirculation pump 5 can detect if there is no liquid present in the system. A demand valve 10 is incorporated into the hand pump 15 which may be opened to allow liquid to pass through.",LEEMING DOUGLAS RICHARD,LEEMING DOUGLAS RICHARD,,https://lens.org/167-623-589-354-677,Patent Application,no,2,0,2,2,0,B67D1/02;;B67D1/102,B67D1/02;;B67D1/10,B8N NJA           NJA;;B8N N24C2A        NJA,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The method is applicable for mature fields which are under review to detect hydrocarbons which have been by-passed during earlier field developments. It uses conventional resistivity measurements to detect electrical anisotropy in each formation based on changes in log response from well to well owing to each well intersecting the formation at varying degrees of relative dip. The processing technique produces horizontal and vertical resistivity curves which are then input to interpretation techniques which have previously been developed to interpret data from multi-component (tri-axial) induction logging tools.,ALDRED RICHARD DOUGLAS,ALDRED RICHARD DOUGLAS,,https://lens.org/193-305-334-984-692,Patent Application,yes,7,3,1,1,0,G01V3/38;;G01V1/48;;E21B49/003;;G01V2210/1429;;G01V2200/16;;G01V3/38,G01V1/48;;E21B49/00;;G01V3/38,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

It accomplishes this by replacing a single larger engine with two smaller engines, connected together via the ICEEU to produce a single rotary output that powers the vehicle. Both engines are used together when power is needed, but one engine can be shut down when the vehicle is cruising and needs less power to simply maintain its forward momentum. The ICEEU effectively removes the second engine completely from the power train when it is unneeded, so that it does not produce any drag, and also allows the second engine to reenter the power train as needed at any RPM or torque. The ICEEU comprises an open differential and two planetary gear sets to provide the phase shifting ratio that allows for a pair of internal combustion engines to be integrated and separated smoothly throughout operation.

A device for administering air, oxygen, or anaesthetic gas to a patient comprises a bellows 1 fitted within a chamber 2, the bellows having a non-return inlet 4, 12 for the respiratory gas and a non-return outlet 5, 13 for passing the gas to the patient, the chamber being adapted to communicate with means 20 capable of alternately introducing a fluid under pressure into the chamber and extracting the fluid from the chamber, the chamber also having a non-return inlet 6, 19 through which gas exhaled by the patient may be drawn into the chamber, the non-return inlet being external of the chamber. As shown, the device also includes a bag 15 which may be used for manually introducing gas into the bellows, safety valves 7, 17, a pressure gauge 18 in either the outlet 5 or the inlet 6, and an outlet 22 having an adjustable pressure release valve opening to atmosphere. The bellows 1 is biased by a weight 3 or by a spring so that it inflates of its own accord and an adjustable calibrated stop 9, 10 limits the volume of gas supplied to the patient. The chamber 2 is of transparent material or is provided with a window so that the bellows 1 may be observed, and the gas is supplied to the patient, e.g. an infant, via the outlet 5 and either a face mask or a tent. It is stated that several bellows 1 may be provided within the chamber 2 so that the device may treat several patients simultaneously.

A voltage digitising system of the type in which a reference voltage is sequentially modified so as to balance the unknown voltage is characterised in that the reference voltage is modified by selecting appropriate tappings from a plurality of interconnected transformers. As described an unknown D.C. voltage is applied across terminals 21,22, Fig. 1, and a known reference voltage is produced by decimally related transformers 10-12 between a terminal 19 and earth. In operation first the unknown D.C. voltage is applied across a capacitor 30 by a chopper contact 20 and then the reference voltage is applied to the capacitor and its output is sampled during the first (positive) half-cycle of the A.C. reference voltage by a contact 32. Any difference between the unknown D.C. voltage and the reference voltage is sequentially reduced by a control unit 35 and uni-selectors 37-40 until a balance condition is reached. The positions of the uni-selectors can then be displayed by an indicator 46. In a modification (Fig. 3 not shown) transformers having binary-codeddecimal related windings are used.

As shown, the bush has a hexagon head 5 and a screw-threaded shank to screw into the rim base from outside the tyre. The bush is bored to provide intercommunicating axial bores 6, 7 of different diameters, the larger bore 7 nearer the head 5 being screw-threaded to receive the fusible metal plug 8 and the smaller bore 6 housing the plunger 11 sealed therein by the disc 12. In alternative arrangements the bush head 5 may be adjacent the smaller plunger-housing bore 6, the bush being screwed into the rim with the head inside the tyre space, or the fusible plug may take the form of a rod passing through holes in the plunger 11 and bush wall, or the form of a circlip engaging a necked portion of the plunger and a step in the bush bore.

   A system of base blocks and attachment blocks used to securely elevate the head of various bed frames, including bed legs and straight back bed frames. Both the base blocks and the attachment blocks have a well disposed within their top surface, which allows for support of a bed leg. The wells of each of the base block and attachment block have removable first and second side pieces, which allow for a straight back bed frame to be securely elevated. The remaining front and rear walls of the well provide a support mechanism for the straight back bed frame, thus providing stability to the elevated bed. The wells on the attachment blocks have a retaining side wall formed therearound, extending past the bottom surface of the attachment block. The retaining side wall of the well is of a size and shape to match the well of the base block or another attachment block, providing a stable nesting feature, thus allowing for the elevation of a bed to be easily adjusted.

A search space is defined, starting with one or more source documents, by examining references from one documents to another and following the networks of references to some level of indirection. Depending on the embodiment, references may be followed from a document containing a reference to a referred-to document, or from a referred-to document to a document containing a reference, or both. Once a search space has been defined, a query is executed, and documents within the search space that satisfy the query parameters are identified. In certain embodiments of the invention, the documents primarily relate to legal materials, and one or more source documents are associated with one or more topics within a topic directory.

    A system for assuring quality-of service for Data Network Telephone (DNT) calls, such as Internet Protocol Network Telephony (IPNT) calls has software for monitoring established DNT calls for adequate bandwidth. A threshold bandwidth, or parameter value related to bandwidth is stored, and tests are periodically made on the DNT call path and compared to the threshold. If the available bandwidth falls below the threshold, an alternative conventional call, such as a PSTN or ISDN call is made to replace the DNT call. Once the alternative call is established, the original call is ended. After the original call is ended, tests of the DNT path continue, and, in some cases, if adequate DNT bandwidth becomes available, the call is switched back to DNT. In some cases, alerts are posted for call participants, and provision is made for approval by one or both participants in a call for a switch in service type to be made.

MIXING EQUIPMENT CO. Inc. July 10, 1958, No. 22156/58. Class 86 [Also in Group XXVI] A driving mechanism for a mixing machine 35 comprises an electric motor 67, Fig. 1, driving, through a shaft 69, coupling 71 and a worm-gear unit, an agitator drive shaft which includes two axially aligned sections 49, 55 connected by a coupling 51, 141 so as to be capable of axial movement in order to effect removal and replacement of a sealing means 75 (Group XXVI). The worm-gear is mounted in a housing 39 and fixed on a quill shaft 57 which is mounted in bearings 59, 61 and connected to the shaft section 49 by a coupling 63. The shaft section 49 is mounted in bearings 45, 47 carried in frame members 41, 37, the upper bearing 45 being located in a threaded housing 113 so that, in order to permit the removal of the seal 75, the shaft may be lifted by the rotation of handles 115 attached to the housing. To effect the seal removal, the clamping nut 133 on the bearing 47 is released and the connected shaft sections lifted as just described, the shaft being retained in the lifted position by lugs 107 in a ring member 99, engaging in a thread-groove 103 in a ring 23 attached to the closure-plate 25 of the mixing machine container; the engagement of the member 99 with the ring 23 also serves as an auxiliary seal while the main seal is removed thus avoiding the draining of pressurized fluid in the container. The coupling 51, 141 is then released, the shaft lifted further and, upon removal of the half-coupling 141, the seal can be removed. The reverse procedure is adopted for reassembly. Fig. 10 shows an arrangement in which a third shaft-section 201 is connected by couplings 51 and 203, 197 to the sections 49, 185 so that when the shafts are lifted as previously described, the section 201, together with the main seal, can be removed as a complete unit. The sealing arrangements described may be applied to containers in which the shaft passes through the bottom or the side of the mixer casing.",MIXING EQUIPMENT CO INC,BOUTROS RICHARD DOUGLAS;;DYKMAN MILTON,,https://lens.org/156-310-715-551-545,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,F16J15/54;;B01F35/4111;;B01F35/10;;B01F35/10,B01F15/00;;F16J15/54,B1C CAJB          CAJB;;B1C C642          CAJB,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A system for assuring quality-of service for Data Network Telephone (DNT) calls, such as Internet Protocol Network Telephony (IPNT) calls has software for monitoring established DNT calls for adequate bandwidth. A threshold bandwidth, or parameter value related to bandwidth is stored, and tests are periodically made on the DNT call path and compared to the threshold. If the available bandwidth falls below the threshold, an alternative conventional call, such as a PSTN or ISDN call is made to replace the DNT call. Once the alternative call is established, the original call is ended. After the original call is ended, tests of the DNT path continue, and, in some cases, if adequate DNT bandwidth becomes available, the call is switched back to DNT. In some cases, alerts are posted for call participants, and provision is made for approval by one or both participants in a call for a switch in service type to be made.

    Methods and apparatus implementing a technique for forming a trap polygon which does not interfere with the print quality of other trap polygons or objects. Edges in close proximity to a color transition edge (CTE) are checked for potential interference. A trap polygon is formed for the CTE that avoids any interfering edges or trap polygons for those edges. The technique can be applied to form a trap polygon for each edge in a page to be printed. In general, in one aspect, forming a trap polygon for trapping a color transition edge, where the trap polygon has an associated trap color determined by colors defining the color transition edge, includes: identifying one or more potentially interfering edges which intersect a keep away zone defined by the color transition edge; screening the potentially interfering edges to identify interfering edges which are part of an object which is of a significantly different color than the trap color; and forming a trap polygon for trapping the color transition edge including shaping the trap polygon to avoid overlapping objects and any trap polygons corresponding to any interfering edges.

Sept. 14, 1961 [June 14, 1960], No. 20832/60. Classes 9 (2) and 92. A rocket launcher latch comprises a spigot 14 with limbs 20, a pivotable part 12 with a lug 23 and detent 28, and depending lugs 30 attached to which is a channelled plate 31. The spigot 14 is held within a bush 15 of launcher plate 13 by a screw 16 (see Fig. 2). The pivotable part 12 is acted upon to rotate about a pin 24 in a clockwise direction by a rat-trap type spring 27, movement being limited by V shaping as at 21. The rocket is placed in the launcher so that its rear face bears on lugs 30, thereby moving part 12 anticlockwise until detent 28 enters a peripheral groove 34 of the rocket. The electrical connections for firing the rocket are firstly via detent 28, insulated from part 12 by bushing 29, and insulated annular contacts within groove 34 to an insulated contact 35 and secondly via a spring 37 and the latch itself to the launcher plate 13. On firing, the efflux of propelling gases impinges on plate 31, thereby forcing pivotable part 12 anticlockwise with consequent removal of detent 28 from groove 34. In a modification, the detent 28 is fixed to part 12 by insulating cement and the springs 27, 37 are replaced by two superimposed leaf springs, one of which is engaged by the chamfered portion 40 of the rocket.",SECR AVIATION,DAVIES DOUGLAS LEON;;NOTT RICHARD SPENCER;;WATTS DOUGLAS HENRY,,https://lens.org/072-166-581-830-274,Granted Patent,no,0,3,1,1,0,F41F3/052,F41F3/052,F3C CLV           CLV,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A lock may be constructed with a locking mechanism that uses either a cam assembly with a cylinder plug perforated by a centrally positioned keyway or a cylinder plug. The locking mechanism may be equipped with a dual armature solenoid. With the dual action solenoid constructed with a single wire coil, the distal ends of coaxially aligned armatures engage opposite axially aligned detents to maintain the lock in its locked state, while application of a potential difference across the coil draws both armatures away from their corresponding detents and toward the bore of the coil, thereby placing the lock into its unlocked state.

Each output may be processed to give values which are linearly dependent upon coin position with the same constant of proportionality. Alternatively, one output is scaled relative to the other to an extent dependent upon the thickness for which the coin is to be tested, so that the thickness-indicating measurement does not vary significantly over a region which corresponds to a likely maximum variation in the position of coins of that thickness.",MARS INC,WAITE TIMOTHY PETER;;ALLAN RICHARD DOUGLAS,,https://lens.org/009-766-144-035-760,Patent Application,no,0,0,23,23,0,G01B7/10;;G07D5/02;;G07D5/02;;G07D5/02;;G01B7/10,G07D5/02;;G01B/;;G01B7/06;;G07D/;;G07D5/08;;G07F/,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
