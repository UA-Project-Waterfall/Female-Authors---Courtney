A domain name system (DNS) resolution service receives a DNS request from a computing resource associated with a virtual private cloud (VPC) in a cloud provider network. The service determines that the VPC is associated with one or more firewall rules. Responsive to determining that the VPC is associated with the firewall rule(s), the service determines whether the DNS request is allowed or blocked according to the one or more firewall rules. If the DNS request is allowed, the service resolves the DNS request using a DNS server and returns a response to the computing resource. If the DNS request is blocked, the service does not resolve the DNS request.",AMAZON TECH INC,ENGSKOW MATTHEW;;THUNGA KIRAN;;SAURABH VIKRAM;;WANG YU;;TAO HUIDA;;GOEL RISHI;;TSAO KEVIS;;RAINA ABHAY;;HERRICK ALEXANDER THOMAS;;DAMICK JEFFREY J;;SHARMA HEMAKSHI,AMAZON TECHNOLOGIES INC (2022-07-14),https://lens.org/014-088-169-252-893,Granted Patent,yes,23,3,1,1,0,H04L41/0806;;H04L61/4511;;H04L63/0272;;H04L63/0227;;H04L63/0236;;H04L63/0272;;H04L41/22;;H04L63/0263;;H04L61/4511,G06F15/16;;H04L9/40;;H04L41/22;;H04L61/4511,,1,0,,,"Anandprasanna Gaitonde, et al., “Using Route 53 Private Hosted Zones for Cross-account Multi-region Architectures”, Retrieved from https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/using-route-53-private-hosted-zones-for-cross-account-multi-region-architectures/, AWS Architecture Blog, Jan. 2021, pp. 1-7.",ACTIVE
