The second plastics material has a greater yield strength than the first plastics material, that is to say the force required to deform or snap the first material is less than the force required to deform or snap the second material. This provides the advantage that a plastics material with a high yield strength may be used to form the rail engaging portion and a different plastics material which has a glossy attractive appearance and/or allows logos or text to be printed on the surface may be used to form the support portion.",HARDIE FERGUS ALLAN GRAEME,HARDIE FERGUS ALLAN GRAEME,,https://lens.org/075-120-277-174-773,Patent Application,no,6,0,5,5,0,A47G25/32;;A47G25/36;;B29C45/16;;B29C45/1615;;B29L2031/735,A47G25/32;;A47G25/36;;B29C45/16,A4L LABF          LABF;;A4L L121          LABF,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
