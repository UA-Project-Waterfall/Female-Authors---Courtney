The processor ( 605 ) ranks the cells ( 217,219,221 ) according to the ranking factor, and sets the pilot signal transmit power of at least one cell in response to the ranking of the cells by adjusting a power amplifier ( 609 ). The cell overlap condition is determined as the handover state of the subscriber unit ( 211,213,215 ) or as the number of cells, which can be received by the subscriber unit ( 211,213,215 ) during the measurement The invention is applicable to 3rd generation cellular communication systems.",MOTOROLA INC,DILLON MATTHEW JAMES;;BRUSCH SIMON;;MURPHY CHRIS,"MOTOROLA MOBILE CO., LTD.

The rounds counter includes a sensor which senses shock due to the firing of the weapon, such as an accelerometer or strain gauge. The sensor could also be an acoustic transducer. Analog and digital circuitry for processing the sensor signal and to count the firing of the gun is also disclosed. The rounds counter is particularly useful as a common, single rounds counter unit for a weapon mount is adapted to receive and fire a variety of weapons, such as remotely operated weapon mounts mounted to military vehicles and patrol watercraft adapted to receive and fire four different types of guns.",RECON OPTICAL INC,QUINN JAMES P;;SEELYE JASON L;;PRICHARD MARK;;DILLON JAMES T,RECON/OPTICAL INC (2007-05-23);;EOS DEFENSE SYSTEMS INC (2009-11-23),https://lens.org/150-833-911-548-612,Patent Application,yes,27,26,9,9,0,F41A19/01;;F41A19/01,F41A35/00,89/1.1,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

    The invention relates to a method and apparatus for setting pilot signal transit powers in a CDMA system. Subscriber units ( 211,213,215 ) perform pilot signal measurement measurements and transmits these to a receiver ( 603 ). A processor ( 605 ) determines a ranking factor for each cell ( 217, 219,221 ) at least partly dependent on the pilot signal measurement and a cell overlap condition of the subscriber unit ( 211, 213, 215 ) during measurements. The processor ( 605 ) ranks the cells ( 217,219,221 ) according to the ranking factor, and sets the pilot signal transmit power of at least one cell in response to the ranking of the cells by adjusting a power amplifier ( 609 ). The cell overlap condition is determined as the handover state of the subscriber unit ( 211,213,215 ) or as the number of cells, which can be received by the subscriber unit ( 211,213,215 ) during the measurement The invention is applicable to 3rd generation cellular communication systems.

The disclosed transceivers can be joined with additional circuits, to form an arrangement that operates as a wireless modem. In each arrangement, light is continuously modulated at either of two precise multiples of the predetermined maximum data rate, and is synchronized to transmitted-data transitions. Upon receipt of light-signals thus produced, the system's receiving transceiver synchronizes received-data electrical output signals to the received modulated light signals.
