   A rodenticide which is non-toxic to humans, domestic animals and livestock comprises a water-retentive material as the active ingredient and a rodent attractant. Preferably the water-retentive material is cellulosic material. In certain embodiments the water-retentive material comprises alpha-cellulose. In one preferred embodiment the cellulosic material comprises purified cellulose derived from the core of the cob of the DK 446 maize hybrid or from the core of the cob of an agonist of the DK 446 hybrid. It is considered that the unique selective toxicity of such rodenticides arises from the interference with water transport through the gut wall, particularly in the caecum (where cellulose is digested in rats). The caecum is vestigial in humans, who are not therefore affected by such materials. A laboratory method of screening candidate water-retentive materials for rodenticidal activity in the field is disclosed, involving examination of the gut (for compaction and bloating) and the caecum (for impaction).

Dawson, G., and Dawson, W. A. March 1. Drilling; drills.-Twist drills in ratchet braces and drilling-machines are provided with means for feeding which at the same time hold them true and support and protect them. Fig. 1 illustrates the invention applied to a ratchet brace. The drill is formed with an annular recess E', Fig. 5, which is engaged by the ends D<2> of spring-controlled levers to secure rotatably the drill in a feed-disk D ; this disk slides on guides G<2> formed on a ring G<1> splined in a ratchet-wheel F, and is screwed to fit the 'interior of a feed-nut A rotatable in the body B but secured by a flange A<2> and nut C.. The drill is driven by a die H tapped to fit it and feathered to rotate with the ratchet-wheel F, which is rotated by a pawl P in the handle as usual. The drill is inserted point first in the die, and the drill and die are passed into the brace and secured by a nut J. To release the drill, the feed-nut is turned to traverse the disk D to the top and withdraw the levers from the recess E<1>. During operation, the feed-nut is rotated by a pawl L, Fig. 2, yieldingly backed by a spring M and engaging ratchet teeth A' on the feed-nut which are rather more than twice as fine as the teeth on the wheel F, enabling the feed-nut to be rotated by the space of about two teeth before the wheel F comes into operation. The feed may be stopped, when required, by a pin N' on a turn-button which disengages the pawl L. Fig. 8 illustrates the invention applied to a drilling-machine. The die H is enclosed by a nut 15 in a removable part 12 attached to a lower arm 5 of the machine frame, and is splined to rotate with a driving-wheel 9. The guides G<2> are attached to the arm 5, and guide a disk D constructed as before. The feed-nut takes the form of a sleeve rotatable by gearing from a hand-wheel 22 and held down by a step 16 adjustable in the bore of an upper arm 2 by a set-screw 18 in a removable bridge-piece.",DAWSON GEORGE;;DAWSON WILLIAM ALFRED,DAWSON GEORGE;;DAWSON WILLIAM ALFRED,,https://lens.org/160-820-264-989-63X,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Ltd. 30 May, 1968, No. 25896/68. Heading H4P. A keyboard transmitter includes a circuit which ensures that the time base is started and stopped at the correct times in spite of poor keying. When a key is operated a character is sent to line via the transmitter under control of time base TB, Fig. 1. Trip-switch TC is operated when a key is pressed, so causing a signal to pass from TC, via gate Gl, to set bi-stable B2, which energizes magnet EM which holds the key down. There being no output g from B2, gates G3, G4 give no output and so the time base starts. Apart from passing pulses to the transmitter, the time base generates pulses P1, P4 and P14 at the beginning, middle, and end, of a character cycle. Consequently magnet EM is de-energized when P4 occurs and the time base is stopped when P14 occurs. If repeat switch RS is operated the time base is not released unt il TC is also operated in response to depression of a key. If either the key or the repeat switch is released during a cycle the time base stops at the end of the current cycle. If a key which has been released in the middle P4 of a cycle is pressed again before the end of the current cycle the time base cycles a second time before stopping, so that the character is transmitted twice.",CREED & CO LTD,DAWSON ROGER WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/109-356-701-789-164,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,3,0,H04L25/40;;H04L25/40,H04L25/40,H4P PB3           -;;H4P PB9           -;;H4P PD3           -;;H4P PE10          -;;H4P PKE           PKE;;H4P PKEX          PKEX;;H4P PL10          -;;H4P PM5           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In the return movement of the lever, due to a spring 22, a lug 20 on the pushing-slide catches a pallet 21 on a sliding shelf 10, and pushes it from under the coin in the slot. When a pin 13 on the pallet arrives at the end of a guide 23, the pallet escapes from the lug on the pushing-slide, and a spring 14 returns the shelf to position. Fig. 6 shows an arrangement for counting a pile of coins which are pushed forwards one by one by a reciprocating plate.",DAWSON JOHN WILLIAM,DAWSON JOHN WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/174-181-796-406-511,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Dawson, J. W. March 27. Fares, registering and checking; receipts, checking and recording.-Apparatus for recording the number and value of coins placed in a cash till, fare box, &c., and for delivering a ticket representing the value of the coins placed therein, comprises a box having a coin slot 4, which is shaped to admit, one at a time only, perfect or slightly bent coins of two denominations, and is provided with weighted toothed jaws 6 for preventing the withdrawal of an inserted coin. The coin 5 when dropped into the slot passes between the stops 7, 8, pushing back the movable stop 8, and causing a pin to strike and depress the detent 14, so that it engages a notch 19 when the spring 18 restores the stop 8 to its normal position after the passage of the coin. The stop 8 being thus locked prevents either the removal of the coin or the insertion of another coin until the first coin has been ejected by the pusher 20, Fig. 8, which is operated by an external handle through gearing and the arm 24. A detent 32 and a toothed segment 31 lock the mechanism unless the external handle is moved through a full or complete stroke, and on the spring 34 subsequently returning the pusher 20 and the bar 24, a pivoted and spring-controlled catch 27 lifts the detent 14 out of the notch 19 and unlocks the stop 8. The pusher 20 drives the coin between stops 39, 35, which are separated to an extent determined by the diameter of the coin, movements of corresponding amplitude being imparted through the toothed and ratchet gearing 40, 41, 44 to the drum 45 over which the ticket tape 47 passes, and to ordinary registering-mechanism. As the ticket is fed forwards to the slot 54, it is marked or perforated by a wheel 59, which is operated by an external pointer through an arm 55 and a rod. The overshooting of the drum 45 and the improper withdrawal of tickets are prevented by a double pawl or catch and by a pivoted stop. The dials of the registering apparatus may be brought to zero by the mechanism described in Specification No. 16, A.D. 1883.",DAWSON JOHN WILLIAM,DAWSON JOHN WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/170-305-613-194-859,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The shaft 5 of the cylinder 8 extends across the dobby and has secured to its other end a ratchet-wheel 6, Fig. 2, adapted to be rotated by a spring-pressed pawl 16 pivoted to an arm 15 rigidly secured to the operating-lever 3 of the dobby. An arm 7 is loose on the shaft 5 and is adjustably connected by a rod 14 to a two-armed lever controlled by a pattern chain forming part of or travelling in unison with the pattern chain of the change-box motion. This chain acts through its lever and the rod 14 to lower the arm 7. so that a finger 18 thereon is lowered to allow the pawl 16 to rotate the ratchet-wheel 6 one tooth and thus stop or start the rotation of the dobby pattern barrel through the action of the cylinder 8 and the lever 23.

The negative B to be examined is placed in a slot in the back of a box 1. The light passing through the negative at the aperture 4 falls on the ground glass 14, and is examined at the aperture 12. The light on the ground glass opposite the aperture 13 is adjusted as to density and colour until it corresponds exactly with the light at 12. The density is adjusted by turning the disc 7 until one of several apertures of different sizes is brought in line with the aperture 5 by which the light enters. The colour is adjusted by another disc 8, having apertures of the same size, but covered with tints of known actinic values. A lens 16 is used to converge the light on the screen 14. In one modification, the rays of light from 4 and 5 are brought close together by reflectors. In another modification, the density of the light at 13 is varied by adjusting a single aperture at different distances. The numbers read off from the edges of the two discs or other arrangements give the printing-value of the negative.",DAWSON JOHN WILLIAM,DAWSON JOHN WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/106-620-175-728-425,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Control of motors. W. R. C. DAWSON. 23 Aug., 1966 [23 Aug., 1965], No. 36173/65. Heading H2J. [Also in Division G3] An automatic control system for a cutting or like apparatus having a tool 11 driven by an A.C. electric motor 12 and a carriage 17 driven by an electric motor 25 for causing relative movement between a workpiece 16 and the tool 11 comprises a sensor 21 for sensing the load current fed to the motor 12, a comparator for comparing the current with a predetermined value, and power control means for controlling the power supplied to the feed motor which power control means is responsive to an output from the comparator and to the magnitude and phase of the voltage supplied to the motor 12 so as to automatically control the relative movement between the tool 11 and the workpiece 16 whereby the power absorbed by the motor 12 tends towards a desired valve. As shown in Fig. 2, the system includes a transistor 43 to the base of which is applied (a) a signal representative of load current exceeding a predetermined value, this signal being derived from the sensor 21 by way of a setting resistor 38 and a reference Zener diode 44, and (b) a signal derived from a transformer 26 having its primary winding connected to the supply for the motor 12, this signal rendering transistor 43 conductive in the absence of an output from the Zener diode 44. The output from the collector of transistor 43, which output is interrupted when the load current exceeds its predetermined value, is applied over a capacitor 45 to control a thyristor 40 in circuit with the armature 35 of the feed motor 25, this circuit being connected across the output from the transformer 26 and receiving a voltage representative of the magnitude and phase of the voltage supplied to the motor 12, and the motor 25 is thus controlled in such a manner that the carriage 17 is moved relative to the tool 11 at a rate sufficient to maintain the power absorbed by the motor 12 constant. A braking diode 46 may be connected across the armature 35, and the system may include limit switches to reverse the direction of the motor 25 when the carriage reaches the end of its travel towards the tool 11. A modified arrangement, including a sensitivity control circuit is described with reference to Fig. 4 (not shown).",DAWSON WILLIAM ROGER CORTLANDT,DAWSON WILLIAM ROGER CORTLANDT,,https://lens.org/073-597-386-208-755,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H02P29/40,H02P29/00,G3R R24           -;;G3R R3            -;;G3R R71           R24;;G3R R72N          R24;;G3R R72Y          R24;;G3R R73           R24;;G3U UBA           UBA;;G3U U205          UBA;;G3U U209          UBA;;H2J J12C          -;;H2J J12H2         -;;H2J J12NX         J2BD;;H2J J12N1         J2BD;;H2J J12N3B        J2BD;;H2J J12N3Y        J2BD;;H2J J2B2B         -;;H2J J2C           -;;H2J J2GX          -;;H2J J2G6A         J2BD;;H2J J2G6CY        J2BD;;H2J J2G6C1        J2BD;;H2J J2J3          J2BD;;H2J J5            -;;H2J J9J           -;;H2J J9X           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The faces of the block also may contain a slot (118) to add an aesthetic appearance to the column. The blocks have certain constructions features that mate with specially constructed brackets in attaching a fence panel to the completed column. The blocks have interlocking elements or projections (122) that permit positive connection between courses of blocks. Projections of one block extend into the core another block. Adjacent blocks can be rotated 90 degrees relative to each other about a vertical axis of each block with each course. The blocks can be used to construct a column that is easy to install and structurally sound.,KEYSTONE RETAINING WALL SYSTEM,MACDONALD ROBERT;;DAWSON WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/044-280-183-214-330,Patent Application,yes,0,1,6,6,0,E04C1/395;;E04C1/395;;E04B2002/0217;;E04B2002/0217;;E04B2002/0267;;E04B2002/0267,E04B2/00;;E04B2/02;;E04C1/39,,0,0,,,,PENDING

In the arrangement shown the transfer unit 17, comprising a flat bar carrying the points 18, is clamped on a sliding carriage 11 traversed tangentially to the circle of machine points 4 by a pinion, driven from the mechanism of the machine, engaging rack teeth 12 thereon; disconnecting means in the carriage drive, or quick return drive, may be provided to enable the carriage to be moved back to its starting position after removal of the unit 17. The carriage 11 is so formed and arranged that the points 18 are inclined upwardly and their ends overlie the ends of the points 4 at the position of closest approach of the latter, the points 4 entering recesses in the underside of the points 18. A wheel 22 with helical blades, or a rotary brush or other device, is placed so as to engage the work at the position where the points 18 and 4 are in register and transfer it progressively from the former to the latter, a guard and guide 26 (Fig. 1, not shown) being provided to prevent the work from coming off the points 4 and to press it further on during the rotation of the point ring; the blades of the wheel 22 enter between successive points, the wheel being rotated by power or by the points acting on its blades, and ensure that the points 4, 18 are properly in register for the transfer of the loops from one set to the other, and the body of the wheel presses the points 18 down on to the points 4. The points 18 may carry a plurality of layers of work, which may be brought forward thereon by a fixed cam 25, and separated by another cam 24 so that only the wheel 22 acts only on the outermost layer or layers. According to the Provisional Specification, the stitching mechanism may be put out of action while work is being transferred on to the point ring so that a second layer of work may be subsequently placed thereon for the two layers 'to be secured together. Means may be provided for rotating the transfer unit through 180 degrees after part of its travel and then continuing the relative movement of the unit and the point ring in such a way that the remainder of the work is placed on the same machine points as the first part.",WOLSEY LTD,LOMAX WILLIAM;;SMITH PHILIP DAWSON,,https://lens.org/121-659-202-565-134,Granted Patent,no,0,2,2,2,0,D05B7/00;;D05D2209/14;;D05B7/00;;D05D2209/14,D05B7/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

June 27. Cylinder machines etc.; brakes; inking-apparatus. -In cylinder machines of the Wharfedale type, the sheets are fed to the cylinder when the bed is running at its slowest speed in order that the machine may be run at a higher speed. The machine is furnished with an arrangement for stopping the cylinder and with a device for controlling the supply of ink to the duct roller. The sheets are fed to the cylinder when the crank is in the position A, Fig. 1, that is, at the termination of the inward stroke. The stop-cylinder 2 makes one complete revolution and part of a second for the purpose of printing and delivering a sheet, the grippers being then in the position 6<A>. The grippers are then brought back to the position 6 to receive another sheet. This is effected by a cam 7 acting on a lever 9, which works on a pivot 10 and is connected to a bar 11, which it causes to reciprocate. To the cylinder is attached a brake disc 13, a projection 13<A> on which encounters a projection 11<A> on the bar 11. The cylinder being thus stopped, the backward movement of the bar 11 brings the grippers back to the position 6. The same arrangement may be applied to a machine having an underfeed. The stop-cylinder 2 is checked in the ordinary manner, and on the checkmotion shaft 18 is secured a lever 19 to which is attached a bar 20 having at the top a slot through which passes a pin on the end of a pivoted lever 23. A spring 24 is placed between a projection on the bar 20 and the lever 23. While the cylinder is checked, this spring is compressed and, although the bar 20 continues to reciprocate, the lever 23 remains in engagement with a projection 11<B> on the bar 11, and the lever 9 is thus held away from the cam 7. When the cylinder is liberated, the spring 24 is allowed to expand and free the lever 23 from the projection 11<B>. To control the supply of ink to the duct roller 25, Fig. 8, a knife-blade 26 is supported close to the roller by a series of wedge - shaped blocks 27 mounted on an inclined bed 28 and adjustable by a screw 29.",DAWSON WILLIAM HENRY;;STOTT JAMES,DAWSON WILLIAM HENRY;;STOTT JAMES,,https://lens.org/034-452-132-754-105,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The machine is arranged so that sheets are fed to the upper part of the cylinder from two feed-boards, a sheet being printed by the cylinder in each direction of movement. The cylinder A is geared to a rack on the reciprocating type bed with which it remains in gear, and is provided with two sets of sheettaking grippers E, E', which take sheets from the feed-tables R, R<1> respectively. The cylinder is shown at one extreme of its oscillating movement, from which position the grippers E' take a sheet from the table R', and, after printing, carry it on to the delivery rollers P', Q<1>, and switch T'. The cylinder moves still further, until the grippers E reach the feed-board R, from which they take a sheet and, after printing, deliver it to the switch T and rollers P, Q. Lifting-fingers K, K' lift the sheet to the switches. The grippers are operated by cams such as are described in the Specification referred to above.

The cylinder revolves, from its position of rest, beyond a complete revolution into the position shown in Fig. 2 for the delivery of the sheet over switches T to nipping-rollers P, Q and a suitable delivery apparatus. Long fingers K lift the leading-edge of the sheet when it is released by the grippers E, and a bowl O in arms N feeds the sheet over the switches to the rollers P, Q. The grippers E are operated to take the sheet by a cam H pivoted at H<1> and operated by levers &c. and cam. The grippers E and fingers K are operated to release and deliver the sheet by a pivoted cam J operated by levers &c. and cam. After the delivery of the sheet the cylinder A is brought back to its position of rest by a catch V pivoted on an arm U rocked by a rod and crank-pin 1, 1. The catch V engages a projection Z on the brake wheel, and moves it back into engagement with a pivoted spring catch Y.

The various panels are composed of light-gauge metal structural studs and tracks. The studs and tracks are mechanically connected using a clinching machine for joining metal studs and tracks ranging in thickness from 16 to 20 gauge. The metal is preferably galvanized steel. The panels, as well as roof trusses, can be made in a plant where the panels can be surfaced or clad with insulation and specified finishes. The structural capacity of the panels is independent of any diaphram strength contributed by the cladding. Field erection of the panels to form a building may be carried out without resort to cranes due to the light weight nature of the panels and using unskilled labour. Field connections may be made using sheet metal screws or by clinching. The on-site joining of one panel to another uses a mating of stud to track in a parallel configuration in which the stud is nested in the track along the joint between panels. This provides a tight, structural continuity between panels. The use of a clinching machine in the manufacture of the panels to provide a mechanical joint equivalent in strength to a welded joint eliminates the need for worker protection from toxic fumes generated by welding galvanized metal, requires less extensive quality control and eliminates spot painting of welds for rust protection.",STRUTT JAMES W;;DAWSON WILLIAM,STRUTT JAMES W;;DAWSON WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/001-463-002-572-473,Patent Application,no,0,4,1,1,0,E04C3/07;;E04B1/08;;E04B5/02;;E04C2/384;;E04C3/11;;E04C2003/0413;;E04C2003/0421;;E04C2003/0434;;E04C2003/0452;;E04C2003/0473;;E04C2003/0491,E04B1/08;;E04B5/02;;E04C2/38;;E04C3/04;;E04C3/07;;E04C3/11,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Partridge, G. W., and Dawson, P. March 14. Couplings; cut-outs.-The supporting-wires of an aerial conductor are carried by insulators mounted upon earthed supports, while supplementary insulators normally short-circuited are placed between the wires and main insulators. When a main insulator fails, this short-circuit is broken, thereby indicating that the main insulator has failed and bringing the supplementary insulator into action. The supporting-wires t are connected to the main insulators o, through tightening-devices t and a short-circuit a' about a supplementary insulator r. When the main insulator o fails, current passing from the conductor n through the supporting -wires t<1>, t' to earth blows the shortcircuit a', thereby introducing the supplementary insulator . The short-circuit a<1> consists of a fuse wire d, Fig. 3, surrounded by a core b of fusible insulating-material, such as a mixture of gutta-percha, and tar, which may be mixed with finely divided material, such as powdered glass, sand, french chalk, or the like. The core b is contained in a tube a of insulating-material, the ends of which are closed by plugs c carrying metal lugs g and disks f, each of which may be formed from a single piece of aluminium. Radial holes h are formed between the cap c and the ends of the tube a, to enable the plugs g to be readily placed in alinement. In the modification shown in Fig. 8 the tube a is made in two parts held together by the core b.

The assembly is used to determine if a leak is present in a portion of the system which includes a vapor collection canister (14). The leak detection assembly incorporates a vacuum actuated canister vent control valve (32) which seals the evaporative system so the leak detection test can be performed. A vacuum actuated pump (28) performs a leak detection test. An engine control (26) initialize the pump by drawing air into a pump cavity and also closes the vent control valve (32). After the initialization period, the pump is activated to pressurize the evaporative emission control system. Once a control pressure is achieved, the cycle rate starts to drop off. If no leak, the pump will continue to pump at a rate that will be representative of the flow characteristics of the size of the leak.

Couplings may be fitted to the pipe ends. A tube for conveying fluid under high pressure, e.g. to a fuel injection engine, comprises a thick-walled inner tube 10, separated by a helical metal spring 11 from outer tube 12, thus allowing the pipe to be bent and clamped without collapsing the outer tube or disturbing the coaxial relationship. The annular space may also contain an electrical resistance wire 30 or hot or cold fluid, to control the temperature of the inner tube. The pipe is coupled to, e.g., a fuel pump discharge union 16 by a connector 14, which has a threaded bore 15 adapted to receive the union 16, and a groove 18 containing an 0-ring seal 19, alternatively, groove 18 may be cut in union 16. The inner tube 10 protrudes sufficiently from outer tube 12 to seat within the bore of union 16, a seal being made by collar 21. Counterbore 22 accommodates outer tube 12 and a high pressure seal comprising ring 24, welded to pipe 12 using welding material 25, compressible packing rings 26 and externally flanged collar 27. The seal is compressed by screwing internally threaded and internally flanged sleeve 29 on to connector 14. A channel 23 may connect counter bore 22 to groove 20 which is in turn connected to a drain or reservoir as indicated schematically by arrow D, so that any fluid leaking to outer tube 12 from inner tube 11 is removed. The reservoir may be provided with a float which actuates an alarm when moved by the collection of fluid from the outer tube. Alternatively, outer tube 12 may contain a fluid under low pressure which, will be increased by any leakage from the inner tube and this increase in pressure can be used to actuate a pressure sensitive alarm system. Where the pipe is only required to transport fluids at moderate pressure the seal between the outer tube and the connector may be made by a simple 0-ring (55, Fig. 2, not shown).",MIRRLEES BLACKSTONE LTD,POPE JOSEPH ALBERT;;DAWSON COLIN WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/167-499-884-216-829,Granted Patent,no,0,2,6,6,0,F16L9/18;;F16L19/061;;F16L39/005;;F16L59/14;;F16L53/32;;F16L53/38;;F16L53/70;;F16L59/14;;F16L19/061;;F16L39/005;;F16L9/18;;F16L53/32;;F16L53/38;;F16L53/70,F16L9/18;;F16L19/06;;F16L39/00;;F16L53/32;;F16L53/38;;F16L53/70;;F16L59/14,F2G G13           G25A;;F2G G22B          G22B;;F2G G22Q          G22B;;F2G G25A          G25A;;F2G G35           G22B;;F2G G35           G25A;;F2P PF23          PF23;;F2P P1A12         P1B5;;F2P P1A15B        P1B5;;F2P P1A16B        P1B5;;F2P P1A3          P1B5;;F2P P1B5A         P1B5;;G1S S15           S15,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

W., and Bulcock, J. D. July 29. Lathes. - Unit lathes are provided with special mandrel feed and stop mechanism, and a bar bed carrying a vertical turret. The mandrel 3, Fig. 2, preferably hollow to take bar stock or receive a chuck of the draw-back collet type operated from the rear end, carries a collar grooved for feed at 14, 15 as controlled by a hand-lever, and one or more leadscrews 21 engagable by nut sections 22 carried by levers 24 cammed into and out of operation by a hand-lever 31. The levers 24 may carry nut sections at each end. A loose pulley 7 confined between collars on the spindle drives, by dogs 11, a sleeve 10 splined on the spindle and controlled by a dog-rod 45. During hand feeding, a bolt 20 between the feed-collar and the sleeve 10 prevents disengagement of the drive, and feed is limited by a rod 42, held against the pulley by a spring 43, contacting with stops carried by the turret. When the lever 31 is moved to close the feed-nut, the bolt 20 is removed, leaving the clutch free to disengage when the rod 45 contacts a stop. The turret consists of a hubbed disk rotatable on the bar bed 36. Three spacing-rollers maintain the concentricity of an outer separate ring. and the tool-holders are adjustably clamped in the space between the ring and disk. The disk has a groove to carry the stops previously referred to, and the ring has a circumferential groove to receive adjustable plates holed to engage an index bolt 63.

Spencer, C. J., and Dawson, J. W. June 11. Single-acting piston pumps; combined liquid and air or gas pumps.-A pump for supplying liquid and air or gas to a pressure reservoir, such as described in Specification 8740/11 for use in connexion with brakes for tramway &c. vehicles and for other purposes, is provided with a clearance space S which is normally filled with air or gas and is of such size that the plunger P<2> at the end of its stroke does not compress the air sufficiently to open the delivery valve P<1> against the minimum working pressure in the reservoir V. At the end of the stroke part of the compressed air escapes to atmosphere through the channel A in the plunger. When the pump begins to draw liquid, the pressure in the space S at the end of the stroke is sufficient to open the valve P' and force a mixture of air and liquid into the reservoir V through the pipe V<1>. The pump then continues to pump liquid only until the supply is exhausted, whereupon it again draws air into the space S. The air thus supplied to the reservoir replaces that which is withdrawn by the dissolving action of the liquid under pressure. The supply of air from the pump may be snpplemented by admitting air through the valve V<6> from a compressed-air reservoir or other source. Or a port P<3> may be provided in the wall of the pump cylinder by means of which additional air may be drawn into the pump and forced with the liquid into the reservoir. In a modification, the valve admitting additional air is actuated by a float in the reservoir V. In another form a float in the reservoir V carries a plunger working in a valved chamber at the top of the reservoir, so that, as the liquid in the reservoir falls, air is drawn in through the valve, and when the float rises, is forced through another valve into the reservoir.",SPENCER CHRISTOPHER JOHN;;DAWSON JOHN WILLIAM,SPENCER CHRISTOPHER JOHN;;DAWSON JOHN WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/146-015-754-752-118,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

COAL INDUSTRY (PATENTS) Ltd. May 3, 1963 [March 9, 1962], No. 9200/62. Heading F1P. In a mine roof support system comprising a plurality of advanceable fluid pressure operated support frames extending along the working face of a mine and each including support props 2, at least some of the frames are each connected to a face conveyer (not shown) by a double-acting ram 17 which normally advances the conveyer towards the working face, but when extended a predetermined amount initiates the advance of its associated frame. Each frame has an associated valve box 16 connected by a branch line 28a to a pressure supply line 28 and by a conduit 32 to a return line 29. The valve box 16 comprises a two position valve 22 having ports 23-26 and a sliding piston 21, the position of which is determined by the extension of the ram 17. As shown the props 2 are supporting the roof, pressure fluid being supplied to the lower ends of each prop cylinder 2a through branch line 28a, conduit 30, port 26 and through each of four pressure operated non-return valves 34. Simultaneously pressure fluid passes from the port 26 through a further pressure operated non- return valve 35 to extend the ram 17 and thereby advance the conveyer. The ram contracting side of ram 17 and the upper ends of each prop cylinder 2a are connected through respective conduits 42, 41 and the port 24 with the return line 29. When the ram 17 is nearly completely extended a lost motion device 18, 20 associated therewith ceases to operate and the piston 21 is moved to the left, whereby, provided pressure operated non-return valves 33 are open, pressure fluid passes from the branch line 28a through port 25 to act on the pistons 34a, 35a of the pressure operated non-return valves 34, 35 and also passes to the conduits 41, 42 to pressurize the upper ends of the props 2 and contract the ram 17. The valves 34, 35 therefore open to allow fluid to pass from the ram 17 and the lower ends of the cylinders 2a through the port 23 to the return line 29. The non-return valves 33 are subjected, through conduits 39a, 40a to the pressure prevailing in the props of the two adjacent support frames whereby advance of a frame is prevented in the event of an adjacent frame being in a non-supporting condition. Contraction of the ram 17 advances the frame until the piston 21 is returned to its frame supporting position wherein conduits 39, 40 are pressurized thereby opening the valves 33 of the two adjacent frames to permit their subsequent advances. Pressure relief valves 36, 37 are provided. The valve 22 may be a rotary valve and the two valves 33 may be combined.",COAL INDUSTRY PATENTS LTD,DAWSON GORDON BERTRAM;;GIBBINS FRANCIS WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/027-004-096-870-80X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,E21D23/0065,E21D23/00,E1P P2A1A         P2A3;;E1P P2A1D1        P2A3;;E1P P2A1D2        P2A3;;E1P P2A3B         P2A3;;E1P P2E1A         P2A3;;E1P P2E3          P2A3;;E1P P2E5D         P2A3;;E1P P2E5G         P2A3;;E1P P2E7          P2A3;;F1D DA3           DA3;;F1D DA3           DZ;;F1D DD            DD;;F1D DD            DZ;;F1D DM1           DM1;;F1D DM1           DZ;;F1D DN            -;;F1D D158          DZ;;F1D D160          DZ;;F1D D178          DZ;;F1D D246          DZ;;F2C C1C9B1        -;;F2C C1C9B2        -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The sleeve S carries a wheel W gearing with a broad pinion P on the armature spindle P' of the motor. The shafts H, Fig. 6, are connected by levers H<1> and rods H<2> to a two-armed lever H<3> mounted on a shaft K and provided with a boss K<2> carrying an arm K<4>, which is locked in position by a catch L. Two sets of rails of different gauge are connected by rails, and, when it is desired to pass from one set of rails to another, the catch L is released and the guideblocks are pulled out of contact with the wheel face by a spring K<3>. The wheels are then free to be moved laterally by the groove in the connecting-rails, and, when the car is on the second set of rails, the wheels are secured in position by resetting the guide-blocks J.

The solution may then be evaporated to dryness, e.g. by spray drying, to yield a solid water-soluble resin. The pH of the reaction mixture is adjusted by addition of borax, sodium carbonate, tertiary sodium phosphate, or dilute caustic soda. The condensation may start with a neutral or slightly acid solution but the pH must be increased above 7 before the insoluble stage is reached. The products may be mixed with wood flour or glass fibres and used for moulding, or may be used in aqueous solution for coating or impregnating materials such as paper, textile fabrics, leather, cork or wood, the resin being insolubilized on the coated material by heating and/or by addition of catalysts, e.g. ammonium chloride, ammonium sulphate, ammonium sulphocyanate, or ammonium hydrogen phosphate. The resins may also be alkylated by reaction with an alcohol, e.g. methanol, ethanol or butanol in presence of sulphuric acid, or by reaction with sodium hydroxide followed by a dialkyl sulphate.

In a method of applying treatment media to moving elongate materials, particularly dyeing travelling yarns, the treatment media is fed intermittently and under the control influence of pneumatic means to a treatment station through which the material passes. One embodiment of apparatus for carrying out the method comprises a body part 11, having two vertically spaced, horizontally disposed through-bores 12, 13, and a vertically disposed feed conduit 14 passing through and communicating with the bores 12, 13. The upper bore 12 is provided with a valve member 17 which is reciprocated by suitable means e.g. a cam, according to a predetermined cycle. The valve member 17 is provided with a portion 17a of reduced diameter which in the open position of the valve member allows treatment media to be drawn up the conduit 14 from a reservoir 15 by virtue of a reduced pressure produced at 16. The junction of the conduit 14 with the lower bore 13 through which the material passes forms the treatment station. The treatment media may be forced up the conduit 14 by virtue of an increased pressure in the reservoir.

Rapping of electrostatic precipitators. W. C. HOLMES & CO. Ltd. Dec. 11, 1961 [June 23, 1961; Sept. 14, 1960], Nos. 31640/60 and 22741/61. Heading B2J. A collecting plate assembly for an electrostatic precipitator comprises collector electrodes 10 in the form of plates pivoted centrally at their upper ends on pins 14, the lower ends of the electrodes 10 being located in a plurality of box movable frameworks 16 which allow a limited movement of the electrodes when the assembly is rapped by a mechanism which acts directly on some of the frameworks 16, the remainder being interconnected by one or more members forming an abutment on which the directly displaceable frameworks may bang. The electrodes 10 are suspended in edge to edge relationship in rows from a fixed framework 13. The electrodes may be of mild steel plate with pressed vertical reinforcing ribs and rolled vertical edges, a clip (not shown) being provided on one vertical edge of each electrode to engage with the adjacent electrode and hold the two in alignment. The lower edge of each electrode is formed with an extension piece 21 of mild steel plate having flats welded to each of its side edges to engage with elements 17 of H-section, which are secured to a framework 16. Each framework 16 is suspended from fixed rods 25 on stirrups 24 and a draw bar 26 of a rapper mechanism (not shown) moves the framework 16 to the left in Fig. 1 and then releases it to effect rapping of the assembly. In each of the assemblies 27 shown in Fig. 8, a swingable framework 31 with rows of electrodes 28 is moved to the left in Fig. 8 by a draw bar 32 of a rapper mechanism, and other rows of electrodes are held in displaceable frameworks 29 joined together at one end by a rigid bar 30. On release of the framework 31 its end 33 bangs against the bar 30 to give thorough rapping without shock to the frame of the assembly.",HOLMES & CO LTD W C,SYKES WILLIAM;;INGHAM CLEMENTS;;COSBY WILLIAM TREVOR;;DAWSON DENNIS HAIGH,,https://lens.org/196-864-962-663-320,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B03C3/76,B03C3/76,B2J JQ            JQ;;B2J J1A           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Automatic voltage control. MARCONI CO. Ltd. May 29, 1962 [June 7, 1961], No. 20541/61. Heading G3R. [Also in Divisions H2 and H3] A D.C. to D.C. converter comprises a transformer whose primary winding 2 is connected in series with a semi-conductor controlled rectifier 3 between input terminals 1, 4 and whose secondary winding is connected through a rectifying and smoothing circuit to output terminals 17,19. On firing the S.C.R. 3 current flows through the winding 2 and the S.C.R,and a capacitor 5 previously charged with point a positive to point b, discharges through the resonant circuit 3, 8, 7, 6, until the terminal b almost attains the positive potential of the terminal 1. Subsequent discharge is prevented by rectifiers 8 and 3. In consequence the potential at point c rises rapidly toward that of b. The potential at d also rises to trigger an S.C.R 10 into conducting the potential at d being clamped by a Zener diode 12. The capacitor 5 discharges through the circuit 6,10, 9, 5 which has a short time period, and the voltage drop across diode 9 shuts off the rectifier 3. Current continues in the circuit 1, 2, 5, 6,10, 4 and the potential at a rises to the potential at 1 when the rectifiers 15 and 18 cut off. The current continues in the series resonant circuit 1, 2, 5, 6,10, 4, and the point a commences an approximately sinusoidal half-wave overswing above the potential 1. This half-cycle is not allowed to be completed but is terminated by the triggering of the device 3. The waveform at a comprises a constant length negative-going portion and a positive going portion of variable length. A sample of the rectified output is fed to a comparator 23 which includes a reference potential source and provides an amplified error signal. This is fed to a unit 24 comprising a modulator, amplifier and demodulator which provides a control signal for a variable frequency oscillator 25 whose output is applied to the rectifier 3. A voltage sensitive device, e.g., a relay, 27 across the input terminals is connected to the oscillator 25 and prevents this from operating when the input voltage falls below a predetermined value. The comparator 23 (Fig. 3) comprises a potential divider 28, 29 whose junction is connected through a Zener diode 30 to the base of an amplifying transistor 32. The output of this is applied to a further transistor operating as an emitter follower, whose collector supply is obtained from a potential divider 36, 37, 38 and whose output, obtained across resistor 35 is fed to the unit 24. On switching on output to the unit 24 is obtained only as the condenser 38 slowly charges up.",MARCONI CO LTD,DAWSON LESLIE HOWARD;;HUNTER IAN;;FRENCH ARTHUR WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/184-305-179-860-203,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H02M3/3155,H02M3/315,H2F FMCS          FMCS;;H2F FMDRS         FMDRS;;H2F FSRD          F9B2;;H2F F23E4A        F23E,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

To achieve this a tapping point 4 is secured about the pipe fitting 1 such as by a strap 5, to secure a gasket 6. A hole 7 is then drilled through the gasket 6 and the pipe fitting 1 down to the pipe threads. A pipe leading from a pump (preferably with a non-return valve) is then attached to the tapping point 4 and the sealant is injected.

Twist drills, sharpening.-Relates to machines of the type in which the drill is fed forwards to the grinding-disk in a V-shaped holder slidably mounted on a rest adapted to swivel about an axis inclined to the vertical, and in which a calliper gauge is provided to adjust the holder to the correct grinding position according to the diameter of the drill under treatment. The invention consists of a particular arrangement of the drill holder and its attachments. The bracket d carrying one of the calliper arms d<1> is provided with a fixed rod f, Fig. 2, fitting into a hole in a lug on the holder proper a. This lug carries the other calliper arm a<1>, adjustment to the gauge of the drill diameter being secured by sliding the holder bar b through the bracket d and locking it in position by means of a screw pin g. The end of the driLl rests against a push-bar l and is fed forwards by means of a screw m. As the push-bar moves forwards, it carries with it a sliding bar n, which is locked in position at the end of the traverse by means of a screw pin o. This ensures an equal traverse of the drill when it is reversed to grind the opposite face. The knife-edged stop h for the point of the drill is "" backed off "" to a greater extent at the base than at the top, and is slightly inclined to the vertical, thereby accommodating a greater range of drill sizes.",MOTTRAM ISAAC EDWARD;;WALKER WILLIAM HENRY;;DAWSON HERBERT,MOTTRAM ISAAC EDWARD;;WALKER WILLIAM HENRY;;DAWSON HERBERT,,https://lens.org/187-237-799-799-682,Granted Patent,no,0,3,1,1,0,B24B3/247,B24B3/24,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Another step is directing brew water to near an upper end of the filter pouch above the particles. The brew water enters the filter pouch without the need for an opening in the pouch, and drops to infiltrate the particles. The particles are partially fluidized by and suspended in the brew water and they rise with the brew water into an empty portion of the filter pouch without a need for opposing sides of the filter pouch to separate to generate internal space. A further step includes brewing a fluid extract from the particles in the filter pouch and discharging the fluid extract from the filter pouch. The filter pouch has sufficient exit area that a fluid extract discharge rate matches a rate of brew water entry into the filter pouch when a fluid head is produced inside the filter pouch which is at least as great as a vertical depth of particles in the filter pouch.",PROCTER & GAMBLE,GUTWEIN ROGER WILLIAM;;DAWSON AMY SUZANNE;;HOWELL CHARLES THOMAS,FOLGER COFFEE COMPANY THE (2011-04-30);;KNUDSEN JEANNETTE L (2008-10-30);;EKONOMON ADAM ESQ (2008-10-30);;PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY THE (1999-03-01);;FOLGERS COFFEE COMPANY THE (2008-10-30),https://lens.org/185-957-491-146-282,Granted Patent,yes,26,63,11,11,0,A47J31/057;;A47J31/057;;A47J31/0642;;A47J31/0642,A47J31/057;;A47J31/06;;A47J31/40,426/433;;426/77;;426/430;;426/435;;426/436,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A method is provided for cleansing a seal of a device used for sealing an evaporative emission control system of an automotive vehicle. The method starts by determining if a request to close the device has been made. If the request to close the device has been made, the method cycles the device a plurality of times to press and lift the seal off of a seat repeatedly. The method also determines if the seal is closed after the cycling step. If the seal is not closed after the cycling step, the method closes the seal. Preferably, the cycling step includes cycling the device at a pre-selected duty cycle, frequency and cycle count. The duty cycle, frequency, and cycle count correspond to calibration tables prepared for the particular device employed to insure that the seal strikes its seat about three times before sealing.

One step is supporting a fully compliant, fluid-permeable filter pouch partially filled with flavor extractable particles (14) such that the pouch is inclined at an angle to horizontal ranging from about 30 .degree.to about 90 .degree.so that the particles accumulate at a bottom end of the filter pouch. Another step is directing brew water to near an upper end of the filter pouch above the particles. The brew water enters the filter pouch without the need for an opening in the pouch, and drops to infiltrate the particles. The particles are partially fluidized by and suspended in the brew water and they rise with the brew water into an empty portion of the filter pouch without a need for opposing sides of the filter pouch to separate to generate internal space. A further step includes brewing a fluid extract from the particles in the filter pouch and dischargi ng the fluid extract from the filter pouch. The filter pouch has sufficient exit area that a fluid extract discharge rate matches a rate of brew water entry into the filter pouch when a fluid head is produced inside the filter pouch which is at least as great as a vertical depth of particles in the filter pouch.",PROCTER & GAMBLE,GUTWEIN ROGER WILLIAM;;DAWSON AMY SUZANNE;;HOWELL CHARLES THOMAS,,https://lens.org/085-535-173-671-748,Granted Patent,no,0,0,11,11,0,A47J31/057;;A47J31/057;;A47J31/0642;;A47J31/0642,A47J31/40;;A47J31/057;;A47J31/06,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The method includes opening a valve of the evaporative emission control system and determining if a vacuum switch of the evaporative emission control system opened. If the vacuum switch opened, a code is set indicating that the vacuum switch passed an opening test. If the vacuum switch did not open, the method determines if a fail timer is greater than a first fail threshold value. The first fail threshold value corresponds to an amount of time within which a properly functioning vacuum switch should open after said valve is opened. If the fail timer is greater than the fail threshold value, the method sets a code indicating that the vacuum switch failed the opening test. If the fail timer is less than or equal to the first fail threshold value, the method increments the fail timer. If the vacuum switch passed the opening test, the method closes the valve of the evaporative emission control system and applies a vacuum thereto. The method then determines if the vacuum switch closed due to the vacuum. If the vacuum switch closed, the method sets a code indicating that the vacuum switch passed a closing test. If the vacuum switch did not close, the method determines if the fail timer is greater than a second fail threshold value. The second fail threshold value corresponds to an amount of time within which a properly functioning vacuum switch should close after the vacuum is applied. If the fail timer is greater than the second fail threshold value, the method sets a code indicating that the vacuum switch failed the closing test. If the fail timer is less than or equal to the second fail threshold value, the method increments the fail timer.",DAIMLER CHRYSLER CORP,DAWSON GARY D;;BLOMQUIST WILLIAM B;;BOOMS CHRIS J,FCA US LLC (2009-06-10);;CHRYSLER LLC (2007-07-27),https://lens.org/103-372-011-053-936,Granted Patent,yes,11,16,1,1,0,F02M25/0809;;F02M25/0809,F02M25/08,73/118.1,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   Section plates in a generator frame are spaced longitudinally or axially one from the other and have ventilation openings for flowing a cooling gas. The ventilation openings comprise in each section plate a plurality of alternating right-side-up and upside-down triangles extending across the bottom of the section plate. The bases of the triangular openings are formed by the housing or wrapper plate enabling free flow unbounded by additional ligaments through the openings in the section plate, reducing the pressure drop and windage losses, while increasing machine efficiency.

    A method of brewing a fluid extract using a filter pouch containing flavor extractable particles. One step is supporting a fully compliant, fluid-permeable filter pouch partially filled with flavor extractable particles such that the pouch is inclined at an angle to horizontal ranging from about 30 to about 90 so that the particles accumulate at a bottom end of the filter pouch. Another step is directing brew water to near an upper end of the filter pouch above the particles. The brew water enters the filter pouch without the need for an opening in the pouch, and drops to infiltrate the particles. The particles are partially fluidized by and suspended in the brew water and they rise with the brew water into an empty portion of the filter pouch without a need for opposing sides of the filter pouch to separate to generate internal space. A further step includes brewing a fluid extract from the particles in the filter pouch and discharging the fluid extract from the filter pouch. The filter pouch has sufficient exit area that a fluid extract discharge rate matches a rate of brew water entry into the filter pouch when a fluid head is produced inside the filter pouch which is at least as great as a vertical depth of particles in the filter pouch.

One step is supporting a fully compliant, fluid-permeable filter pouch partially filled with flavor extractable particles (14) such that the pouch is inclined at an angle to horizontal ranging from about 30 ° to about 90 ° so that the particles accumulate at a bottom end of the filter pouch. Another step is directing brew water to near an upper end of the filter pouch above the particles. The brew water enters the filter pouch without the need for an opening in the pouch, and drops to infiltrate the particles. The particles are partially fluidized by and suspended in the brew water and they rise with the brew water into an empty portion of the filter pouch without a need for opposing sides of the filter pouch to separate to generate internal space. A further step includes brewing a fluid extract from the particles in the filter pouch and discharging the fluid extract from the filter pouch. The filter pouch has sufficient exit area that a fluid extract discharge rate matches a rate of brew water entry into the filter pouch when a fluid head is produced inside the filter pouch which is at least as great as a vertical depth of particles in the filter pouch.",PROCTER & GAMBLE,GUTWEIN ROGER WILLIAM;;DAWSON AMY SUZANNE;;HOWELL CHARLES THOMAS,,https://lens.org/062-242-328-198-358,Patent Application,yes,4,0,11,11,0,A47J31/057;;A47J31/0642;;A47J31/057;;A47J31/0642,A47J31/057;;A47J31/06;;A47J31/40,,0,0,,,,PENDING

    Section plates in a generator frame are spaced longitudinally or axially one from the other and have ventilation openings for flowing a cooling gas. The ventilation openings comprise in each section plate a plurality of alternating right-side-up and upside-down triangles extending across the bottom of the section plate. The bases of the triangular openings are formed by the housing or wrapper plate enabling free flow unbounded by additional ligaments through the openings in the section plate, reducing the pressure drop and windage losses, while increasing machine efficiency.

   A method of brewing a fluid extract using a filter pouch containing flavor extractable particles. One step is supporting a fully compliant, fluid-permeable filter pouch partially filled with flavor extractable particles such that the pouch is inclined at an angle to horizontal ranging from about 30 to about 90 so that the particles accumulate at a bottom end of the filter pouch. Another step is directing brew water to near an upper end of the filter pouch above the particles. The brew water enters the filter pouch without the need for an opening in the pouch, and drops to infiltrate the particles. The particles are partially fluidized by and suspended in the brew water and they rise with the brew water into an empty portion of the filter pouch without a need for opposing sides of the filter pouch to separate to generate internal space. A further step includes brewing a fluid extract from the particles in the filter pouch and discharging the fluid extract from the filter pouch. The filter pouch has sufficient exit area that a fluid extract discharge rate matches a rate of brew water entry into the filter pouch when a fluid head is produced inside the filter pouch which is at least as great as a vertical depth of particles in the filter pouch.

A vacuum actuated pump which performs a leak detection test. An engine control unit initializes the pump by drawing air into a pump cavity and also closes the vent control valve. After the initialization period, the pump is activated to pressurize the evaporative emission control system. Once a control pressure is achieved, the cycle rate starts to drop off. If no leak exists in the system, the pump will eventually stop pumping. If there is a leak, the pump will continue to pump at a rate that will be representative of the flow characteristics of the size of the leak.

    A method is provided for detecting a small or gross leak in an evaporative emission control system of an automotive vehicle. The method includes initially purging and then sealing the evaporative emission control system. A vacuum switch coupled to the evaporative emission control system is then monitored for an opening event caused by a loss of a natural vacuum created in the evaporative emission control system. If said opening event is detected, the method determines if a leak check timer has exceeded a first or second predetermined threshold value. If the leak check timer has not exceeded said first predetermined threshold value a first fault code is set indicating that the gross leak has been detected. If the leak check timer has not exceeded the second predetermined threshold value, a second fault code is set indicating that the small leak has been detected. The first threshold value corresponds to an amount of time required for a leak to be detected having a diameter of about 0.070 inches or greater. The second threshold value corresponds to an amount of time required for a leak to be detected having a diameter of about 0.040 inches or greater.

Each headend determines which packets are in error (i.e. missing or jumbled) and need to be re-transmitted to the headend from the distribution station. After such a determination, each headend communicates a request over a land-link, e.g. telephone line or internet, to the distribution station requesting re-transmission of the packets in error. The distribution station then re-transmits these particular packets either via the land-link or the satellite. Re-transmission in non-real time via the land-link allows the headend to simultaneously receive packets via satellite and land-link so as to reduce the time taken to transmit files from the distribution station to the headends.
