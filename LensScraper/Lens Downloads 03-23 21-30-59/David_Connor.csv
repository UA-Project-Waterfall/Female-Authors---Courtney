The electronics module is operable to detect when the processed ECG output includes spurious or otherwise anomalous peaks. Where an anomalous peak is detected, the ECG output is corrected by sequentially applying a series of correcting steps and analysing each one to determine which correcting step provides the least anomalous one. Anomalous peaks are detected by looking at the heart rate variability and determining that an anomaly is present when the rate of change of heart rate is above a threshold level. The threshold level is configured depending upon certain criteria such as the activity level of a person whose heart rate is being monitored or selected subject-specific criteria. Thus, an improved ECG output is produced, which, when displayed to a wearer of the electronics module is more informative and understandable.",PREVAYL INNOVATIONS LTD,DRISCOLL CONNOR DAVID,,https://lens.org/148-218-573-260-109,Patent Application,yes,3,0,3,3,0,A61B5/7207;;A61B5/7221;;A61B5/7239;;A61B5/327;;A61B5/02438;;A61B5/352;;A61B5/1118;;A61B2562/0219;;A61B5/349;;A61B5/02438;;A61B5/327;;A61B5/364;;A61B5/7203,A61B5/00;;A61B5/024;;A61B5/11;;A61B5/327;;A61B5/352,,1,1,051-134-595-196-464,10.1109/tbme.2003.808831;;12669990,"MATEO, J.LAGUNA P.: ""Analysis of heart rate variability in the presence of ectopic beats using the heart timing signal"", IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, vol. 50, no. 3, March 2013 (2013-03-01)",PENDING

The first stage of the process is to exclude pixels that cannot be corners by comparing the candidate pixel with a set of non-contiguous pixels around the candidate pixel to determine whether the difference exceeds a first threshold then counting the results and if the count does not exceed a second threshold then that candidate pixel is eliminated as potential corner (Figure 4 not shown). For each potential corner pixel each pixel in a contiguous pattern surrounding it is then compared to two thresholds and two vectors are generated based on the results of this comparison. The first vector represents the results of comparing whether the pixels in the pattern exceed the candidate pixel by a threshold value and the second is the result of comparing whether the pixels in the pattern are lower than the candidate pixel by a second threshold value. These vectors are then reduced to scalar values and the individual bits in each scalar are counted/added and if the counts are individually less than a value (suitably 9 or more) then the candidate pixel is discarded. A vector is then generated from the scalar values of those pixels greater than the candidate pixel by a threshold and this is compared with a vector containing each possible combination of pixel arrangements that could constitute a corner(see figure 6 for example) with a match indicating the pixel is a corner.

TATE & LYLE REFINERIES Ltd. Dec. 29, 1969 [Sept. 26, 1968], No. 45721/68. Heading C6B. A process for producing solid particulate sugar comprises drying droplets of a sucrose-containing syrup in a moving airstream having entrained therein seed particles of a sucrose-containing solid. In apparatus for performing the method, a mixture of carbonated raw syrup and fine or granulated liquors is pumped from a blending tank 30 to a steam-heated feed tank 32, and thence to evaporators 33, 35, a pump 4 feeding the concentrated syrup to a rotary atomizer 3 in a spray dryer 1. Air is introduced into the top of the spray dryer via a disperser 6, the air having been heated by a heater 9 which is heated by a steam supply 36. The seed particles are introduced by a separate air supply through a duct 22, the two air streams being thoroughly mixed as they enter the drying chamber. A fan 7 is provided for cooling the motor driving the atomizer. The side walls of the spray chamber are vibrated to loosen solid product adhering to them by knocking plates 2. The solid product is conveyed by a screw conveyer 15 to a rotary cooler 16, the output from which passes to a sifter 19, in which large lumps are rejected and taken to a remelt plant 39. The cooling air from the cooler 16 is mixed with air from the dryer 1 and passed via duct 11 to a cyclone 12 from which the separated sugar particles pass to the sifter 19. The sifted solid product is conveyed to a recycle hopper 18 having a screw feeder 20 which is driven through a variable speed gear to enable the proportion of recycled solids to be controlled, recycling being effected by conveying- distintegrating fans 21 which break up sugar agglomerations. An overflow pipe from the recycle hopper 18 feeds product hopper 37 from which the product passes to a packing plant. The temperature of the air entering the dryer 1 is from 80 to 260‹C.

It further discloses a multi-stage method of detecting corners in an image. The first stage of the process is to exclude pixels that cannot be corners by comparing the candidate pixel with a set of non-contiguous pixels around the candidate pixel to determine whether the difference exceeds a first threshold then counting the results and if the count does not exceed a second threshold then that candidate pixel is eliminated as potential corner (Figure 4 not shown). For each potential corner pixel each pixel in a contiguous pattern surrounding it is then compared to two thresholds and two vectors are generated based on the results of this comparison. The first vector represents the results of comparing whether the pixels in the pattern exceed the candidate pixel by a threshold value and the second is the result of comparing whether the pixels in the pattern are lower than the candidate pixel by a second threshold value. These vectors are then reduced to scalar values and the individual bits in each scalar are counted/added and if the counts are individually less than a value (suitably 9 or more) then the candidate pixel is discarded. A vector is then generated from the scalar values of those pixels greater than the candidate pixel by a threshold and this is compared with a vector containing each possible combination of pixel arrangements that could constitute a corner(see figure 6 for example) with a match indicating the pixel is a corner. Alternatively a vector mask may be generated from the aforementioned scalar by creating vector were the elements are all ones if the corresponding point exceeded the threshold or all zeroes otherwise.",LINEAR ALGEBRA TECH LIMITED,CORMAC BRICK;;BRENDAN BARRY;;FERGAL CONNOR;;DAVID MOLONEY,,https://lens.org/131-213-267-985-451,Patent Application,no,0,0,12,12,0,G06V10/955;;G06V10/44;;G06T7/13;;G06T7/12;;G06T7/136;;G06V10/44;;G06V10/955,G06T7/12;;G06T7/13;;G06T7/136;;G06V10/44,,1,0,,,None,INACTIVE

The apparatus includes a rotary cooler positioned immediately downstream from a rotary kiln such that the rotary cooler receives the heated product stream at a first, elevated temperature. The rotary cooler includes an initial cooling portion that reduces the temperature of the DRI product stream from the first, elevated temperature to a second, reaction temperature. The rotary cooler includes an oven portion position immediately downstream from the initial cooling portion. The temperature of the product stream is maintained at the second, reaction temperature as the product stream moves through the oven portion. A plurality of gas distribution pipes extend along the interior of the rotary cooler in the oven portion to distribute a supply of natural gas beneath the product stream within the oven portion. The introduced natural gas causes the heated DRI to transform into iron carbide. A plurality of burners are positioned to indirectly heat the product stream in the oven portion to maintain the product stream at the second, reaction temperature.

Also, it allows local memory buffers to be simple, and so there is no need for a complex cache architecture.",TRINITY COLLEGE DUBLIN;;GERAGHTY THOMAS DERMOT;;GREGG DAVID;;MCELROY BARTLEY;;CONNOR FERGAL;;MCELROY CIARAN,GERAGHTY THOMAS DERMOT;;GREGG DAVID;;MCELROY BARTLEY;;CONNOR FERGAL;;MCELROY CIARAN,,https://lens.org/135-871-033-041-95X,Search Report,yes,1,0,2,2,0,G06F17/16,G06F17/16,,9,7,067-970-498-771-572;;001-588-633-360-441;;004-770-468-565-338;;067-013-023-416-345;;138-220-290-899-586;;113-966-884-156-564;;141-806-082-558-732,10.1109/fpl.2008.4629999;;10.1007/11587514_9;;10.1109/fpl.2007.4380769;;10.1177/1094342004041296;;10.1109/icpp.2004.1327917;;10.1145/1046192.1046202;;10.1145/1046192.1046203,"MCGETTRICK S ET AL: ""An FPGA architecture for the Pagerank eigenvector problem"", PROCEEDINGS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FIELD PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC AND APPLICATIONS 2008 (FPL 2008), 8-10 SEPTEMBER 2008, HEIDELBERG, GERMANY, 8 September 2008 (2008-09-08), pages 523 - 526, XP031324414, ISBN: 978-1-4244-1960-9;;MOLONEY D ET AL: ""Streaming sparse matrix compression/decompression"", PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HIGH-PERFORMANCE EMBEDDED ARCHITECTURES AND COMPILERS (HIPEAC 2005), 17-18 NOVEMBER 2005, BARCELONA, SPAIN, LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE, vol. 3793, November 2005 (2005-11-01), pages 116 - 129, XP019024259, ISBN: 978-3-540-30317-6;;SUN J ET AL: ""Mapping sparse matrix-vector multiplication on FPGAs"", PROCEEDINGS OF THE THIRD ANNUAL RECONFIGURABLE SYSTEMS SUMMER INSTITUTE (RSSI'07), 17-20 JULY 2007, URBANA, ILLINOIS, USA, 17 July 2007 (2007-07-17), XP002571763, Retrieved from the Internet <URL:http://rssi.ncsa.illinois.edu/proceedings/papers/rssi07_12_paper.pdf> [retrieved on 20100305];;GREGG D ET AL: ""FPGA based sparse matrix vector multiplication using commodity DRAM memory"", PROCEEDINGS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FIELD PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC AND APPLICATIONS 2007 (FPL 2007), 27-29 AUGUST 2007, AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS, 27 August 2007 (2007-08-27), pages 786 - 791, XP031159191, ISBN: 978-1-4244-1059-0;;EUN-JIN IM ET AL: ""SPARSITY: Optimization framework for sparse matrix kernels"", INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING APPLICATIONS, vol. 18, no. 1, 2004, pages 135 - 158, XP002571764;;LEE B C ET AL: ""Performance models for evaluation and automatic tuning of symmetric sparse matrix-vector multiply"", INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PARALLEL PROCESSING 2004 (ICPP 2004), 15-18 AUGUST 2004, MONTREAL, QC, CANADA, 15 August 2004 (2004-08-15), pages 169 - 176, XP010718617, ISBN: 978-0-7695-2197-8;;ZHUO L ET AL: ""Sparse matrix-vector multplication on FPGAs"", PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2005 ACM/SIGDA 13TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON FIELD-PROGRAMMABLE GATE ARRAYS (FPGA'05), 20-22 FEBRUARY 2005, MONTEREY, CALIFORNIA, USA, 2005, XP002571765;;DELORIMIER M ET AL: ""Floating-point sparse matrix-vector multiply for FPGAs"", PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2005 ACM/SIGDA 13TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON FIELD-PROGRAMMABLE GATE ARRAYS (FPGA'05), 20-22 FEBRUARY 2005, MONTEREY, CALIFORNIA, USA, 2005, XP002571772;;SMAILBEGOVIC F ET AL: ""Sparse matrix storage format"", PROCEEDINGS OF THE 16TH ANNUAL WORKSHOP ON CIRCUITS, SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING, NOVEMBER 2005, VELDHOVEN, NETHERLANDS, November 2005 (2005-11-01), pages 445 - 448, XP002571766",PENDING

   A hierarchy of software components is created based on the programming constructs therein using a computer linked to a database having a collection of legacy software therein. Key component characteristics, e.g., programming constructs are defined. These constructs are assigned weights based on the difficulty or ease with which they can be reused in a new software component for use with a Web system or other network system. The legacy collection is searched to determine which, if any, of the key constructs are included therein. An ordered list is output that includes a list of the components containing the key constructs. The order of the list is based on the weight of the constructs in each component and the frequency with which they occur in each component. The list is then used to determine the effort and thus, the expense required to move entire components or blocks of code in the components into a Web system or other network system.
