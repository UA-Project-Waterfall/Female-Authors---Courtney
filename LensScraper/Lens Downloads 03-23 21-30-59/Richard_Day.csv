Testing-apparatus for telegraphy. BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH Ltd. Feb. 5, 1958 [Feb. 18, 1957], No. 5457/57. Class 40 (3). A pulse-distortion detecting device for an electrical signalling system in which the signals have one or the other of two values, and each value is nominally maintained for at least a fixed predetermined period, comprises timing means for comparing with a reference standard the period of time during which either value of the signals is maintained and giving an alarm if any signal period is of less duration than the reference standard. In the arrangement described for telegraph signals of marking and spacing elements, the mark-space and spacemark transistions trigger separate one-shot multivibrators having a relaxation time equal to the duration of the reference standard and if, during the period in which a vibrator operated by one of the transitions is passing an output, the opposite signal transition takes place, a signal is transmitted to the error-detecting circuit which may include a relay which becomes locked until a release action is taken. With signals exceeding the predetermined reference standard each multivibrator restores to its initial condition before the opposite transition takes place. In the diagrammatic arrange - ment, Fig. 1, the incoming signals are applied to a toggle V1 which has its sides A, B conducting in response to marks and spaces respectively. In response to a space or starting element a one-shot multivibrator V2 is operated to pass from its B side to a gate V4 a pulse of the reference standard duration, and the toggle V1, if changed to mark before the expiry of this duration, passes a pulse from its A side through the gate V4 to a pulse amplifier V6 which operates a gas-filled trigger V7 to actuate a relay RA controlling an alarm circuit. Similarly, the transition to mark operates V1 to produce a pulse from its A side to trigger one-shot multivibrator V3 and if the toggle V1 reverts to space before the expiry of the reference time duration, a pulse from its B side passes through the gate V5 to operate V6, V7 and the alarm relay RA. If the received pulses are of duration greater than the reference period, the pulse from the B side of vibrator V2 or V3 has been cut off from V4 or V5 before the opposite transition has taken place to provide the pulse from the A or B side respectively of the toggle V1. The detailed circuit arrangement corresponding to Fig. 1 has been described in connection with Fig. 2 (not shown).",BRITISH TELECOMM RES LTD,DAY RICHARD ALLEN,,https://lens.org/045-580-762-141-384,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H04L1/248,H04L12/26,H4P PEM           PEM,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Central buffing and draw gear; rubber springs. AVON INDIA RUBBER CO. Ltd. May 26, 1960 [May 26, 1959], No. 17956/59. Classes 103(5) and 108(3). A central buffing and draw gear comprises a shell member 12 attached to a forward follower 13 and telescopically movable over a shell 10 forming a hydraulic fluid reservoir welded to a rear follower 2, a casing member 1 welded to the follower 2 and fixed to an intermediate follower 3 having an annular projection 5, springs 6, 14, and a spindle 15 which may co-operate with a separate piston 7 movable in hydraulic fluid in the casing 1. When a load is applied through a yoke to the follower 13, assembly shear pins 16 are broken, and the spring 14 is alone compressed until the follower 13 abuts the end of the spindle 15, whereafter the springs 6, 14 and the hydraulic unit operate in parallel. In a modification the spindle 15 in Fig. 1 may be extended to contact the follower 13 so that the springs and hydraulic unit operate always in parallel. The spring 6 provides a recoil force, but if pressure on the forward side of the piston 7 exerts a force greater than the force of the spring 6 then the piston will move off the spindle and allow fluid to flow through the duct 18 in the manner of a safety valve, thus preventing excess pressure being exerted on the seals 17.

The method of the invention improves the efficiency of the braking procedure. The braking method initially determines if the deadman's switch is engaged. If it is, then the electric service motor is plugged at a predetermined minimum plug rate until the vehicle slows to a specified velocity. When the specified velocity is reached, the plugging operation is terminated. The mechanical brake is then engaged to slow the vehicle to a halt. When the vehicle comes to a halt, the parking brake remains engaged. The invention also improves safety by increasing the controlled rate of plugging to a maximum value in the event that the deadman's switch is off. Actual braking performance by plugging is compared with that of accepted rates of deceleration or plugging effort shown by armature current to verify operation of the service braking system. In the event of inadequate service braking, such braking is terminated and the mechanical brake is applied.",,DAY RICHARD M,,https://lens.org/177-457-836-953-282,Granted Patent,no,0,0,6,8,0,B60L7/006;;B60L7/006;;B60L3/02;;B60L3/02;;B60L7/24;;B60L7/24;;B60L2200/42;;B60L2200/42;;B60L2240/30;;B60L2240/30;;Y02P90/60;;Y02P90/60,B60L3/02;;B60L7/24,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The method of the present invention involves generally the reaction of the above-described 4-[1-oxoalkyl]-2,5-oxazolidinediones so produced with a thiol amine having a geometry amenable to forming the precursor of the desired beta-lactam-containing compound or, in one scheme, forming the beta-lactam-containing compound itself directly. This is done either by direct reaction of the 4-1 OOD with a thiol amine (which by one pathway proceeds directly to the beta-lactam-containing compound) or by first converting the 4-1 OOD to its 2-[1-oxoalkyl]-2-amino acid form before its reaction with the thiol amine; and then forming the beta lactam by action of cyanogen.

Telegraph distortion measuring apparatus. BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH Ltd. May 16, 1958 [May 22, 1957], No. 16320/57. Class 40(3). Telegraph signals applied through a valve V1 trigger a bistable circuit V2, V3 back and forth, the resulting anode waves being differentiated in circuits 31 32, 36 and 34, 35, 37 to produce impulse. corresponding to the mark-to-space anc space-to-mark transitions which are applied through a valve V4 to brighten a cathode-ray tube spiral time base for the purpose of indicating distortion. Ir accordance with the invention, the telegraph signals, which appear at ter minal 10, are applied to valve Vl from the junction of two resistors 63, 64 which are returned to a potentiometer 62 con nected between positive and negative voltage supplies. By this means any potential level on which the incoming signals are superimposed may be offset by a potential from potentiometer 62 so that the signals applied to Vl have a mean level corresponding to earth potential. In effect incoming single-current signals are converted to double-current form suitable for triggering the bistable circuit V2, V3. To facilitate the correct setting of potentiometer 62, the incoming signals may be taken from terminal 61 and displayed by deflection of a normal linear time base. The impulses from V4 are applied to intensity modulate the trace and provide a line of bright spots indicating the level of the incoming signals at which the bistable circuit is triggered. Potentiometer 62 is adjusted until this level coincides with a desired level of the signal.",BRITISH TELECOMM RES LTD,DAY RICHARD ALLEN;;WHITE ROBERT EDWARD,,https://lens.org/055-776-322-822-829,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,H04L1/248;;H04L1/248,H04L12/26;;H04L25/04,H4P PEM           PEM,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The method of the invention improves the efficiency of the braking procedure. The braking method initially determines if the deadman's switch is engaged. If it is, then the electric service motor is plugged at a predetermined minimum plug rate until the vehicle slows to a specified velocity. When the specified velocity is reached, the plugging operation is terminated. The mechanical brake is then engaged to slow the vehicle to a halt. When the vehicle comes to a halt, the parking brake remains engaged. The invention also improves safety by increasing the controlled rate of plugging to a maximum value in the event that the deadman's switch is off. Actual braking performance by plugging is compared with that of accepted rates of deceleration or plugging effort shown by armature current to verify operation of the service braking system. In the event of inadequate service braking, such braking is terminated and the mechanical brake is applied.",RAYMOND CORP,DAY RICHARD M ELY PARK APARTME,,https://lens.org/078-540-389-973-043,Patent Application,yes,0,10,6,8,0,B60L7/006;;B60L7/006;;B60L3/02;;B60L3/02;;B60L7/24;;B60L7/24;;B60L2200/42;;B60L2200/42;;B60L2240/30;;B60L2240/30;;Y02P90/60;;Y02P90/60,B60L3/02;;B60L7/24,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The method of the invention improves the efficiency of the braking procedure. The braking method initially determines if the deadman's switch is engaged. If it is, then the electric service motor is plugged at a predetermined minimum plug rate until the vehicle slows to a specified velocity. When the specified velocity is reached, the plugging operation is terminated. The mechanical brake is then engaged to slow the vehicle to a halt. When the vehicle comes to a halt, the parking brake remains engaged. The invention also improves safety by increasing the controlled rate of plugging to a maximum value in the event that the deadman's switch is off. Actual braking performance by plugging is compared with that of accepted rates of deceleration or plugging effort shown by armature current to verify operation of the service braking system. In the event of inadequate service braking, such braking is terminated and the mechanical brake is applied.",RAYMOND CORP,DAY RICHARD M ELY PARK APARTME,,https://lens.org/013-923-966-874-02X,Search Report,yes,2,0,6,8,0,B60L7/006;;B60L7/006;;B60L3/02;;B60L3/02;;B60L7/24;;B60L7/24;;B60L2200/42;;B60L2200/42;;B60L2240/30;;B60L2240/30;;Y02P90/60;;Y02P90/60,B60L3/02;;B60L7/24,,1,0,,,"PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN vol. 7, no. 177 (M - 233) 5 August 1983 (1983-08-05)",EXPIRED

The net recovery system consists of a net shaped into the configuration of the surface of a cone having a closed apex and an open circular base. A rigid hoop is attached to the open circular base. A main lift line has one end connected to a firing mechanism, such as a helicopter, and the other end connected to a releasable hook. A releasable lift line is connected at one end to the releasable hook and the other end connected to the apex of the net. A hoop lift line has one end connected to the main lift line above the releasable hook and the other end connected to the hoop. A net lift line has one end connected to the main lift line above the releasable hook and the other end connected to the apex of the net. The net lift line is substantially longer than the hoop lift line and the hoop lift line is substantially longer than the releasable lift line. A typical recovery method is for the helicopter pilot to (1) lower the net system by the apex of the net with the open hoop directly over the torpedo until the torpedo is within the net, (2) actuate the releasable hook that releases the releasable lift line from the apex of the net, (3) raise the helicopter and the main lift line and net lift line (that has slack and is connected to the apex) which captures the torpedo in the net, and (4) raise the net and torpedo from the water by the hoop lift line and the net lift line which preferably have lengths selected to hold the torpedo in the horizontal position in the net.

This cooling chamber 24, unlike the conventional cooling chamber, is constituted to such a shape which allows the passage of the small drops of molten glass formed by the melting end of a heated preform before the formation of the optical fiber and has a diameter considerably greater than the diameter of the optical fiber. The device has also an intermediate cooling pipe 28 of such a shape which allows the passage of the small drops of the molten glass for the purpose of further cooling the drawn optical waveguide fiber and for coupling an annealer 26 to the cooling chamber 24. The method for drawing the optical waveguide fiber consists in supplying the optical fiber preform, heating the preform in the heating furnace as the preform passes the inside of the heating furnace 22 and drawing the optical fiber from the heated preform.",LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES INC,DAY RAY-LONG;;GARNER HUFF RICHARD;;LYNCH BRIAN,,https://lens.org/159-238-548-463-462,Patent Application,no,0,1,3,3,0,C03B37/02718,G02B6/00;;C03B37/027;;C03B37/029,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The sensing system can be used to emulate physical buttons or slider switches that are either displayed on an active display device or printed on an underlying surface. The capacitive sensor can further be used as an input device for a graphical user interface, especially if overlaid on top of an active display device like an LCD screen to sense finger position (X/Y position) and contact area (Z) over the display. In addition, the sensor can be made with flexible material for touch sensing on a three-dimensional surface. Because the sensor is substantially transparent, the underlying surface can be viewed through the sensor. This allows the underlying area to be used for alternative applications that may not necessarily be related to the sensing system.

A synergistic processing unit (SPU) includes a handler that works in conjunction with a memory flow controller (MFC) to traverse a disjoint linked data structure. The handler compares a search value with a node value, and provides the MFC with an effective address of the next node to traverse based upon the comparison. In turn, the MFC retrieves the corresponding node data from system memory and stores the node data in the SPU's local storage area. The MFC stalls processing and sends an asynchronous event interrupt to the SPU which, as a result, instructs the handler to retrieve and compare the latest node data in the local storage area with the search value.

A stoichiometric equivalent of anhydrous ammonia gas is fed to the mixer for direct reaction with the glyphosate acid as it is agitated within the mixer. A water jacket containing circulating water or other suitable heat transfer facilitating means readily known to those in the art is adapted to the mixer and used to remove heat from the reactor produced by the exothermic reaction. The moisture content of the glyphosate wet cake, the design of the mixer including a preferred close tolerance relation between the inner walls of the reactor and its mixing impellers together with the relative location of the ammonia gas inlet in the mixer/reactor and maintenance of a reaction temperature of about 60 °C or below are all important process variables. The ammonium glyphosate thereby produced is a highly sorptive, water-soluble powder suitable for end use as a plant growth regulator or as a herbicide without further processing. Due to the highly sorptive character of the reaction product, however, it is particularly well-suited for further formulation to absorb/adsorb an exceptionally high level of adjuvants such as wetting agents, anti-foaming agents and, in particular, surfactants.",PASSLEY PAUL LEONARD,DAY THOMAS MCCABE;;GILLESPIE JANE LAURA;;KRAMER RICHARD MELVYN,,https://lens.org/046-604-667-416-829,Patent Application,yes,7,9,31,31,0,A01N57/20;;C07F9/3813;;C07F9/38;;A01N57/20;;C07F9/3813,A01N57/20;;C07F9/38;;C07F9/54,,0,0,,,,PATENTED

The packet contains a Binding Update option that specifies the virtual IP address as a Home Address.

A load-balancing node intercepts a TCP SYN packet addressed to a virtual IP address. The load-balancing node selects a server node from among multiple server nodes, and sends the packet toward the server node. The server node sends an IPv6 packet toward the client node. The packet contains a Binding Update option that specifies the virtual IP address as a Home Address. This information causes the client node to replace destination addresses in outgoing IP packets so that packets that the client node would have sent toward the virtual IP address are sent toward the selected server node's IP address instead.

   A printed wiring board is formed from two or more layers, one of which has circuit lines formed thereon, and wherein the surfaces of the circuit lines are roughened only in areas that require good copper to laminate adhesion. The remainder of the circuit line surfaces are smooth. Thus, those areas for propagation of the signal on signal lines have the circuit lines smooth to maximize the signal propagation effect, while those areas where the signal propagation is not critical are rough, which improves the adhesion of one layer to another. On the voltage planes, the surface in those regions opposite the smooth surfaces of the signal planes is smooth. Thus, these areas of the voltage planes can be maintained smooth while the other areas of the surface of the voltage planes can be roughened, providing good adhesion to the adjoining dielectric material.

Latency proves are also provided for determining the latency of various servers within a network. Service metric probes consult a configuration file containing each DNS name in its area and the set of services. Each server in the network has a metric test associated with each service supported by the server which the service metric probes periodically performs metric tests on and records the metric test results which are periodically sent to all of the DNS servers in the network. DNS servers use the test result updates to determine the best server to return for a given DNS name. The latency probe calculates the latency from its location to a client's location using the round trip time for sending a packet to the client to obtain the latency value for that client. The latency probe updates the DNS servers with the client's latency data. The DNS server uses the latency test data updates to determine the closest server to a client.,SPEEDERA NETWORKS INC,SWILDENS ERIC SVEN-JOHAN;;DAY RICHARD DAVID;;GUPTA AJIT,,https://lens.org/187-877-570-132-201,Search Report,yes,1,0,6,85,0,H04L41/509;;H04L67/06;;H04L67/1095;;H04L67/1008;;H04L67/1027;;H04L67/101;;H04L67/02;;H04L67/1038;;H04L67/289;;H04L69/329;;H04L61/4541;;H04L61/4511;;H04L67/1001;;H04L67/568,H04L12/24;;H04L29/06;;H04L29/08;;H04L29/12,,1,0,,,"SCHEMERS R J: ""lbnamed: a load balancing name server in Perl"", PROCEEDINGS OF THE SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATION CONFERENCE.

   According to the present invention, an improved photoimagable cationically polymerizable epoxy based solder mask is provided that contains a non-brominated epoxy resin system and from about 0.1 to about 15 parts, by weight per 100 parts of resin system, of a cationic photoinitiator. The non-brominated epoxy-resin system has solids that are comprised of from about 10% to about 80% by weight, of a polyol resin having epoxy functionality; from about 0% to about 90% by weight of a polyepoxy resin; and from about 25% to about 85% by weight of an difunctional epoxy resin. Since the photosensitive cationically polymerizable epoxy based solder mask does not contain bromine, it is particularly advantageous halogens in waste processing chemicals or in incinerated scrap circuit boards are regulated by environmental concerns. The photosensitive cationically polymerizable non-brominated epoxy based solder mask has a glass transition temperature greater than about 100 C., preferably greater than about 110 C. The solder mask dries to a tack-free film; thus, artwork used in the photoimaging process will not stick to the dried soldermask film. The polyol resin which is a condensation product of epichlorohydrin and bisphenol A, has a weight average molecular weight of between about 40,000 and 130,000. The polyepoxy resin is an epoxidized multi-functional bisphenol A formaldehyde novolak resin having a weight average molecular weight of 4,000 to 10,000. The epoxidized diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A has two epoxide groups per molecule, a melting point of between about 80 C. and about 110 C. and a weight average molecular weight of between about 600 and 2,500.

SPD also supports persistence and returns the same IP addresses, for a given client. The entire Internet address space is broken up into multiple zones. Each zone is assigned to a group of SPD servers.

    A scalable domain name system with persistence and load balancing receives requests from client DNS servers or other DNS servers. Each DNS server is associated with a subset of the DNS groups in the network and the invention checks to see if the client DNS server is part of the DNS group that the DNS server is authoritative. If the DNS server is not authoritative for the client DNS server's group, then the request is forwarded to the proper DNS server. Otherwise, the invention checks a persistence table to see if a persistent response is required for the request. If a persistent response is required, the appropriate IP address entry in the table is returned to the requestor. If a persistent response is not required, the invention determines the load, availability, and latency of the content servers from information stored in a latency table to determine the proper content server's address to return to the requestor. The DNS server sends any responses to forwarded requests to the client DNS server. When more than one DNS server is authoritative for an overlapping DNS group, the invention ensures that the persistence and latency tables are synchronized with any other DNS servers. The invention also allows the persistence and latency tables to be located on a set of table servers within the network. Another aspect of the invention allows the DNS server that a request is forwarded to, to respond directly to the client and the client is redirected to the DNS server.

    A printed wiring board is formed from two or more layers, one of which has circuit lines formed thereon, and wherein the surfaces of the circuit lines are roughened only in areas that require good copper to laminate adhesion. The remainder of the circuit line surfaces are smooth. Thus, those areas for propagation of the signal on signal lines have the circuit lines smooth to maximize the signal propagation effect, while those areas where the signal propagation is not critical are rough, which improves the adhesion of one layer to another. On the voltage planes, the surface in those regions opposite the smooth surfaces of the signal planes is smooth. Thus, these areas of the voltage planes can be maintained smooth while the other areas of the surface of the voltage planes can be roughened, providing good adhesion to the adjoining dielectric material.

One layer has a circuit line formed on the layer. In a surface of the circuit line, only a region where proper adhesive force of copper/laminated plate is requested is made rough. A remaining part of a circuit line face is smooth. Thus, a region for signal transport on a signal line makes the circuit line to be smooth, and signal transport effect is made maximal. The region, where signal transport is not important, becomes rough and improves the adhesive force of one layer with the other layer. In a voltage layer 26, a face on a region facing a smooth face of the signal layer 10 is smooth. Consequently, the regions of the voltage layer 26 are maintained smooth, but the other region on the surface of the voltage layer 26 is made rough, and satisfactory adhesive force is given to a contacted dielectric. <P>COPYRIGHT: (C)2004,JPO",IBM,DAY RICHARD ALLEN;;KNADLE KEVIN TAYLOR;;STAUFFER KRISTEN ANN,,https://lens.org/029-264-738-444-444,Patent Application,no,0,3,5,5,0,H05K1/0242;;H05K3/382;;H05K3/384;;H05K3/385;;H05K3/429;;H05K2201/09309;;H05K2203/0315;;H05K2203/0361;;Y10T29/49128;;Y10T428/24942;;Y10T29/49126;;Y10T428/24917;;Y10T29/49117;;Y10T29/49124;;Y10T29/49128;;Y10T428/24942;;Y10T29/49126;;Y10T428/24917;;Y10T29/49117;;Y10T29/49124;;H05K1/0242;;H05K3/385;;H05K2203/0315;;H05K3/382;;H05K3/429;;H05K2201/09309;;H05K3/384;;H05K2203/0361,H05K1/02;;H05K3/38;;H05K3/42;;H05K3/46,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The packet contains a Binding Update option that specifies the virtual IP address as a Home Address. This information causes the client node to replace destination addresses in outgoing IP packets so that packets that the client node would have sent toward the virtual IP address are sent toward the selected server node's IP address instead.

DNS servers use the test result updates to determine the best server to return for a given DNS name. The latency probe calculates the latency from its location to a client's location using the round trip time for sending a packet to the client to obtain the latency value for that client.

The torque sensing arrangement includes a magnet and a non-contact magnetoresistive (MR) sensor that measures movement of the handle relative to the tiller arm which is used to determine operator steering intent, i.e., the amount of steering force applied to the handle. The MR sensor provides accurate torque measurements regardless of the angle of the tiller arm. The steering assist system further includes a driving unit with a steerable drive wheel, and a servomotor. The amount of steering assist provided by the servomotor to the drive wheel is at least partially determined based on the measured operator steering intent.",HANNA TIMOTHY T;;DAY RICHARD M;;MCDONOUGH JAMES M;;RAYMOND CORP,HANNA TIMOTHY T;;DAY RICHARD M;;MCDONOUGH JAMES M,THE RAYMOND CORPORATION (2010-03-11),https://lens.org/120-841-005-640-11X,Granted Patent,yes,23,7,2,11,0,B62B5/063;;B62D1/14;;B62D5/0418;;B62D6/10;;B66F9/0759;;B62D1/14;;B62D5/0418;;B62B5/063;;B66F9/0759;;B62D6/10,B62D1/14;;A01B69/00;;B62D5/06;;B62D6/00;;B62D7/00;;B62D11/00;;B62D12/00;;B62D51/04;;B63G8/20;;B63H25/04;;G05D1/00;;G06F7/00;;G06F17/00;;G06F19/00,701/41;;701/42;;701/43;;701/44;;180/19.1;;180/19.2;;180/19.3;;180/332;;180/412,1,0,,,"Honeywell Sensor Products, Linear / Angular / Rotary Displacement Sensors, ssec.honeywell.com online catalog, 900246, 8-00 Rev.

The load-balancing node selects a server node from among multiple server nodes, and sends the packet toward the server node. The server node sends an IPv6 packet toward the client node. The packet contains a Binding Update option that specifies the virtual IP address as a Home Address. This information causes the client node to replace destination addresses in outgoing IP packets so that packets that the client node would have sent toward the virtual IP address are sent toward the selected server node's IP address instead.

An autonomous processor module sends commands to the vehicle controller in response to messages received via a communication network from a guidance and navigation system. The guidance and navigation system transmits a message over the communication network, wherein that message contains a first numerical value specifying the velocity and a second numerical value specifying an amount that the propulsion drive system is to turn a wheel of the industrial vehicle. The message also specifies a maximum speed limit and indicators commanding that a load carried by the industrial vehicle be raised and lowered. The autonomous processor module transmits a feedback message indicate actual vehicle operating parameters to the guidance and navigation system. -31- soo co c I cx I- Of- [i 2 I I cj) 0) I £D3 JCOj m o6Z O nH <OcI4 + r-C>Z,",RAYMOND CORP,DAY RICHARD M;;HARVEY DEAN S;;PAGE STEPHEN L,,https://lens.org/088-877-542-504-654,Patent Application,no,0,0,8,8,0,G05D1/0221;;G05D1/0236;;G05D1/0272;;B66F9/063;;B66F9/0759;;G05D1/0221;;G05D1/0272;;G05D1/0236;;B66F9/0759;;B66F9/063,G05D1/10;;G05D3/00,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Latency probes are also provided for determining the latency of various servers within a network. Service metric probes consult a configuration file containing each DNS name in its area and the set of services. Each server in the network has a metric test associated with each service supported by the server which the service metric probes periodically performs metric tests on and records the metric test results which are periodically sent to all of the DNS servers in the network. DNS servers use the test result updates to determine the best server to return for a given DNS name. The latency probe calculates the latency from its location to a client's location using the round trip time for sending a packet to the client to obtain the latency value for that client. The latency probe updates the DNS servers with the clients' latency data.

    A content delivery and global traffic management network system provides a plurality of caching servers connected to a network. The caching servers host customer content that can be cached and stored, and respond to requests for Web content from clients. If the requested content does not exist in memory or on disk, it generates a request to an origin site to obtain the content. A DNS Server (SPD) load balances network requests among customer Web servers and directs client requests for hosted customer content to the appropriate caching server which is selected by choosing the caching server that is closest to the user, is available, and is the least loaded. SPD also supports persistence and returns the same IP addresses, for a given client. The entire Internet address space is broken up into multiple zones. Each zone is assigned to a group of SPD servers. If an SPD server gets a request from a client that is not in the zone assigned to that SPD server, it forwards the request to the SPD server assigned to that zone. Servers write information about the content delivered to log files that are picked up by a log server.

Latency probes are also provided for determining the latency of various servers within a network. Service metric probes consult a configuration file containing each DNS name in its area and the set of services. Each server in the network has a metric test associated with each service supported by the server which the service metric probes periodically performs metric tests on and records the metric test results which are periodically sent to all of the DNS servers in the network. DNS servers use the test result updates to determine the best server to return for a given DNS name. The latency probe calculates the latency from its location to a client's location using the round trip time for sending a packet to the client to obtain the latency value for that client. The latency probe updates the DNS servers with the clients' latency data. The DNS server uses the latency test data updates to determine the closest server to a client.,AKAMAI TECH INC,SWILDENS ERIC SVEN-JOHAN;;DAY RICHARD DAVID;;GUPTA AJIT K,SPEEDERA NETWORKS INC (2001-09-13);;AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES INC (2005-12-28),https://lens.org/071-148-534-853-275,Patent Application,yes,6,111,4,85,0,H04L12/14;;H04L41/5083;;H04L41/509;;H04L67/06;;H04L67/1095;;H04L67/1008;;H04L67/1027;;H04L67/101;;H04L67/02;;H04L67/1038;;H04L69/329;;H04L61/4541;;H04L61/4511;;H04L67/1001;;H04L12/14;;H04L41/5083;;H04L41/509;;H04L67/1095;;H04L67/1027;;H04L69/329;;H04L67/06;;H04L67/1008;;H04L67/101;;H04L67/1038;;H04L67/02;;H04L61/4511;;H04L61/4541;;H04L67/1001,H04L12/14;;G06F15/16;;H04L12/24;;H04L29/06;;H04L29/08;;H04L29/12,709/224;;709/230;;709/231,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A computer system uses effective address mapping of support processors' local memory to share resources between separate operating systems. When threads are created for either operating system, the thread's corresponding processor memory is mapped into an effective address space. In doing so, the processor's local memory is accessible by the thread, regardless of whether the processor is running, or whether the processor is executing a different thread from a different operating system. For example, a computer system may have eight support processors and running two operating systems whereby the first operating system requires six support processors and the second operating system requires all eight support processors.

Latency probes are also provided for determining the latency of various servers within a network. Service metric probes consult a configuration file containing each DNS name in its area and the set of services. Each server in the network has a metric test associated with each service supported by the server which the service metric probes periodically performs metric tests on and records the metric test results which are periodically sent to all of the DNS servers in the network. DNS servers use the test result updates to determine the best server to return for a given DNS name. The latency probe calculates the latency from its location to a client's location using the round trip time for sending a packet to the client to obtain the latency value for that client. The latency probe updates the DNS servers with the clients' latency data. The DNS server uses the latency test data updates to determine the closest server to a client.,AKAMAI TECH INC,SWILDENS ERIC SVEN-JOHAN;;DAY RICHARD DAVID;;GUPTA AJIT K,SPEEDERA NETWORKS INC (2001-09-13);;AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES INC (2005-12-28),https://lens.org/194-015-815-942-814,Granted Patent,yes,19,11,6,85,0,H04L12/14;;H04L41/5083;;H04L41/509;;H04L67/06;;H04L67/1095;;H04L67/1008;;H04L67/1027;;H04L67/101;;H04L67/1038;;H04L69/329;;H04L67/02;;H04L61/4541;;H04L61/4511;;H04L67/1001;;H04L12/14;;H04L41/5083;;H04L41/509;;H04L67/06;;H04L67/1095;;H04L67/1008;;H04L67/1027;;H04L67/101;;H04L67/1038;;H04L69/329;;H04L61/4511;;H04L61/4541;;H04L67/1001;;H04L67/02;;H04L43/0805,G06F15/173;;H04L12/14;;H04L12/24;;H04L12/26;;H04L29/06;;H04L29/08;;H04L29/12,709/226;;709/232;;718/105;;370/229,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The capacitive sensor can further be used as an input device for a graphical user interface, especially if overlaid on top of an active display device like an LCD screen to sense finger position (X/Y position) and contact area (Z) over the display. In addition, the sensor can be made with flexible material for touch sensing on a three-dimensional surface. Because the sensor is substantially transparent, the underlying surface can be viewed through the sensor. This allows the underlying area to be used for alternative applications that may not necessarily be related to the sensing system.

The power spectral density graph reveals peaks that are not due to noise, that are then analyzed to provide for a calculation of percent stenosis or complete occlusion of the carotid artery.",CVR GLOBAL INC,KLINE BRET;;BAKEMA PETER;;TRUONG YOUNG;;FINLAYSON RICHARD;;DAY ORVILLE,,https://lens.org/138-237-389-368-583,Patent Application,yes,9,2,13,26,0,A61B5/684;;A61B5/6843;;A61B5/6844;;A61B5/7203;;A61B5/726;;A61B5/742;;A61B7/04;;A61B8/06;;A61B5/02007;;A61B5/6822;;H04R29/00;;A61B2560/0425;;A61B2560/0431;;A61B2560/0462;;A61B2562/0204;;A61B2562/166;;A61B5/7257;;A61B5/0285;;A61B5/7221;;A61B2560/0276;;A61B5/684;;A61B5/6843;;A61B5/6844;;A61B5/7203;;A61B5/726;;A61B5/742;;A61B7/04;;A61B8/06;;A61B5/02007;;A61B5/6822;;H04R29/00;;A61B2560/0425;;A61B2560/0431;;A61B2560/0462;;A61B2562/0204;;A61B2562/166;;A61B5/7257;;A61B5/0285,A61B5/02;;A61B5/0205;;A61B5/11;;A61B7/04;;A61B8/06;;H04R29/00,,2,1,010-100-420-346-720,10.1142/s0219477506003574,"BIER, M ET AL.: ""Murmurs and noise caused by arterial narrowing - Theory and clinical practice"", FLUCTUATION AND NOISE LETTERS, vol. 6, no. 4, 8 December 2006 (2006-12-08), pages 415 - 425, XP055448922;;See also references of EP 3471606A4",PENDING

Further modification of the glucagon peptides by forming intramolecular bridges or the substitution of the terminal carboxylic acid with an amide group produces peptides exhibiting glucagon/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist activity. The solubility and stability of these high potency glucagon analogs can be further improved by modification of the polypeptides by pegylation, acylation, alkylation, substitution of carboxy terminal amino acids, C-terminal truncation, or the addition of a carboxy terminal peptide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 26 (GPSSGAPPPS), SEQ ID NO: 27 (KRNRNNIA) and SEQ ID NO: 28 (KRNR).",BIANCHI ELISABETTA;;PESSI ANTONELLO;;DAY JONATHAN;;DIMARCHI RICHARD;;SMILEY DAVID;;ISTITUTO DI RECERCHE DI BIOLOG MOLECOLARE P ANGELETTI S R L;;UNIV INDIANA RES & TECH CORP,BIANCHI ELISABETTA;;PESSI ANTONELLO;;DAY JONATHAN;;DIMARCHI RICHARD;;SMILEY DAVID,INDIANA UNIVERISY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION (2009-06-25);;MSD ITALIA S.R.L (2012-11-13);;ISTITUTO DI RECHERCHE DI BIOLOGIA MOLECOLARE P.

The sensing system can be used to emulate physical buttons or slider switches that are either displayed on an active display device or printed on an underlying surface. The capacitive sensor can further be used as an input device for a graphical user interface, especially if overlaid on top of an active display device like an LCD screen to sense finger position (X/Y position) and contact area (Z) over the display. In addition, the sensor can be made with flexible material for touch sensing on a three-dimensional surface. Because the sensor is substantially transparent, the underlying surface can be viewed through the sensor. This allows the underlying area to be used for alternative applications that may not necessarily be related to the sensing system. Examples include advertising, an additional user interface display, or apparatus such as a camera or a biometric security device.

   A content delivery and global traffic management network system provides a plurality of caching servers connected to a network. The caching servers host customer content that can be cached and stored, and respond to requests for Web content from clients. If the requested content does not exist in memory or on disk, it generates a request to an origin site to obtain the content. A DNS Server (SPD) load balances network requests among customer Web servers and directs client requests for hosted customer content to the appropriate caching server which is selected by choosing the caching server that is closest to the user, is available, and is the least loaded. SPD also supports persistence and returns the same IP addresses, for a given client. The entire Internet address space is broken up into multiple zones. Each zone is assigned to a group of SPD servers. If an SPD server gets a request from a client that is not in the zone assigned to that SPD server, it forwards the request to the SPD server assigned to that zone. Servers write information about the content delivered to log files that are picked up by a log server.

Latency probes are also provided for determining the latency of various servers within a network. Service metric probes consult a configuration file containing each DNS name in its area and the set of services. Each server in the network has a metric test associated with each service supported by the server which the service metric probes periodically performs metric tests on and records the metric test results which are periodically sent to all of the DNS servers in the network. DNS servers use the test result updates to determine the best server to return for a given DNS name. The latency probe calculates the latency from its location to a client's location using the round trip time for sending a packet to the client to obtain the latency value for that client. The latency probe updates the DNS servers with the clients' latency data. The DNS server uses the latency test data updates to determine the closest server to a client.,AKAMAI TECH INC,SWILDENS ERIC SVEN-JOHAN;;DAY RICHARD DAVID;;GUPTA AJIT K,SPEEDERA NETWORKS INC (2001-09-13);;AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES INC (2005-12-28),https://lens.org/012-140-520-821-225,Granted Patent,yes,6,41,4,85,0,H04L12/14;;H04L41/5083;;H04L41/509;;H04L67/06;;H04L67/1095;;H04L67/1008;;H04L67/1027;;H04L67/101;;H04L67/02;;H04L67/1038;;H04L69/329;;H04L61/4541;;H04L61/4511;;H04L67/1001;;H04L12/14;;H04L41/5083;;H04L41/509;;H04L67/1095;;H04L67/1027;;H04L69/329;;H04L67/06;;H04L67/1008;;H04L67/101;;H04L67/1038;;H04L67/02;;H04L61/4511;;H04L61/4541;;H04L67/1001,H04L12/14;;G06F15/16;;H04L12/24;;H04L29/06;;H04L29/08;;H04L29/12,709/235;;370/229,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
