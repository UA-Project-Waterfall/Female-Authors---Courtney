The method is based on the discovery that the lymphocytes of A.I.D.S. patients are unusually resistant to antithymocyte serum, and that the plasma of A.I.D.S. patients is capable of conferring this resistance to normal lymphocytes. Accordingly, the diagnostic method involves performing rosette inhibition tests on the patient's lymphocytes or on lymphocytes from a healthy donor after treatment with the patient's plasma.

The net charge is derived from a charge pump circuit that is controlled by a charge pump-up signal whose duration is proportional to the detected phase difference between the data and the clock, and a charge pump-down signal whose duration is one clock cycle. The magnitude of the current supplied for a pump-up signal is twice that supplied for a pump-down signal. When the data pulse is centered within a clock cycle, the duration of a pump-up signal is one half that of a pump-down signal.

The detector apparatus uses a separate bypass loop for conveying part of the reactor coolant away from the core, and at least three separate delayed-neutron detectors mounted proximate this detector loop. The detectors are spaced apart so that the coolant flow time from the core to each detector is different, and these differences are known. The delayed-neutron activity at the detectors is a function of the dealy time after the reaction in the fuel until the coolant carrying the delayed-neutron emitter passes the respective detector. This time delay is broken down into separate components including an isotopic holdup time required for the emitter to move through the fuel from the reaction to the coolant at the breach, and two transit times required for the emitter now in the coolant to flow from the breach to the detector loop and then via the loop to the detector. At least two of these time components are determined during calibrated operation of the reactor. Thereafter during normal reactor operation, repeated comparisons are made by the method of regression approximation of the third time component for the best-fit line correlating measured delayed-neutron activity against activity that is approximated according to specific equations. The equations use these time-delay components and known parameter values of the fuel and of the part and emitting daughter isotopes.",US ENERGY,GROSS KENNY C;;STRAIN ROBERT V,ENERGY UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AS REPRESENTED BY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF (1981-04-24),https://lens.org/189-379-689-068-121,Granted Patent,yes,1,14,1,1,0,G21C17/04;;G21C17/04;;Y02E30/30,G21C17/04,376/216;;376/245;;376/246;;376/253;;376/450,1,0,,,"Gross et al.; ""Development of a Methodology For Analysis of Delayed-Neutron Signals"" ANL-79-57.",EXPIRED

A visibility roadmap data structure permits precomputation of coarse representations of collision-free paths through an environment, together with estimates of pair-wise visibility between scene portions. At runtime, path planning can be done using the precomputed roadmap values to find a coarse path, and then refined to the camera path using occlusion maps computed on-the-fly. Iterative smoothing, together with a physically-based camera model, can be used to have the path followed by the camera smooth in both space and time. The data structure can be adapted at runtime to deal with dynamic occluders that move in an environment.",SUMNER ROBERT;;GROSS MARKUS;;THUEREY NILS;;OSKAM THOMAS;;DISNEY ENTPR INC,SUMNER ROBERT;;GROSS MARKUS;;THUEREY NILS;;OSKAM THOMAS,DISNEY ENTERPRISES INC (2011-08-03);;THE WALT DISNEY STUDIOS (SCHWEIZ) GMBH (2010-08-09),https://lens.org/116-458-309-610-722,Granted Patent,yes,1,46,1,1,0,A63F13/5258;;A63F13/5258;;A63F2300/6653;;A63F2300/6661;;A63F2300/6661;;G06T15/20;;G06T15/20;;G06T13/00;;G06T13/00;;G06T13/20;;G06T13/20,G06T13/00,345/474;;345/473,33,19,116-805-767-470-29X;;088-466-443-786-602;;150-246-851-206-664;;011-318-430-812-113;;101-954-391-843-434;;053-840-538-440-839;;067-297-704-358-272;;009-674-756-882-807;;008-115-476-962-063;;122-358-264-161-888;;123-535-500-679-736;;001-136-233-772-167;;106-209-001-602-179;;031-187-847-362-080;;050-535-863-011-915;;074-264-748-851-352;;067-117-976-989-210;;108-024-191-733-402;;087-850-942-616-19X,10.1109/cscwd.2005.194281;;10.1145/641480.641491;;10.1145/1501750.1501779;;10.1111/j.1467-8659.2008.01181.x;;10.1007/10991541_5;;10.1109/robot.2006.1642052;;10.1145/966131.966132;;18045016;;10.1162/neco.2007.10-06-361;;10.1109/tvcg.2003.1207447;;10.1145/3828.3830;;10.1111/1467-8659.00510;;10.1145/237170.237259;;10.1145/1053427.1053433;;10.1017/cbo9780511546877;;10.1109/robot.2004.1307195;;10.1109/cgi.2004.1309225;;10.1163/156855300741960;;10.15607/rss.2005.i.004;;10.1109/tra.2002.804040,"Zhang et al., Octree-based Camera Planning in Virtual Environments, Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design, May 2005, pp. 767-771.;;Salomon et al., Interactive Navigation in Complex Environments Using Path Planning, Proceedings of the 2003 Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics, 2003, pp. 41-50.;;Li et al., Real-Time Camera Planning for Navigation in Virtual Environments, Smart Graphics 2008, Lectures Notes in Computer Science 5166, Aug. 2008, pp. 118-129.;;Hamazaki et al., Extracting Camera-Control Requirements and Camera Movement Generation in a 3D Virtual Environment, Proceedings of the 2008 International Conference on Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology, 2008, pp. 126-129.;;Christie et al., Camera Control in Computer Graphics, Computer Graphics Forum, vol. 27, No. 8, 2008, pp. 2197-2218.;;Bandyopadhyay T., et al., ""Stealth tracking of an unpredictable target among obstacles,"" Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics VI, Erdmann M. et al., (Eds.).

The closed container is placed in a household microwave oven which is operated for the requisite period. The chemical germicide is distributed and activated within the container by microwave radiation. Preferred Features: The container may have a compartment holding the germicide chemicals which remains closed until the main container has been closed. The chemicals may be enclosed in a secondary sealed bag which is mechanically ruptured when required releasing the contents. The container may also contain a screen arrangement which prevents exposure of metal parts to microwaves. Successful sterilization is signaled by a suitable physical or chemical color-sensor. Following sterilization, liberated unused chemicals are broken down by a suitable catalyst.

The novel injection mold and injection molding machine for producing over-molded art icles comprises an array of one or more cores which engage arrays of one or more first cavity and arrays of one or more composite cavities. Each composite cavity is formed from t he combination of a second cavity and a cavity extension which carries at least a p ortion of the different geometrical profile, such as a thread. In one embodiment, the cavity e xtension comprises a pair of cavity portions which are mounted adjacent the core to later ally moveable slides on a movable plate, that can be a stripper plate. During molding of the f irst layer, the cavity extension elements are moved ""out"" of alignment with the first cavity and during molding of the second layer the cavity extension elements are moved ""in"" to form the composite cavity with the second cavity so that only the second layer replicates the geometrical profile of the composite cavity.

A therapeutic regimen useful in the present invention includes an arginine-free parenteral formulation administered with or followed by the administration of an anti-endotoxin antibody, an interleukin-1 or interleukin-2 receptor antagonist, an anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody or a combination thereof. Most preferably, the administration of an arginine-free parenteral formulation augments the anti-hypotensive effect of the various antibodies and antagonist described so as to provide an effective treatment for various forms of hypotension. The therapeutic regimens of the invention are proposed to provide for a decrease in nitric oxide synthase, and thereby an increase in blood pressure in vivo, particularly in animals with cytokine- and/or endotoxin-induced hypotension. The parenteral formulation of the therapeutic regimen and methods of the invention are arginine-free and provide a decrease in plasma arginine levels. Reduced plasma, serum, or tissue levels of arginine in the animal function to augment the hypertensive action of the various antibodies and antagonist to be administered concurrently or subsequent to the administration of the parenteral formulation.

A therapeutic regimen useful in the present invention includes an arginine-free parenteral formulation administered concurrently with or followed by an arginine analog. The combination therapy provides an augmentation of the anti-hypotensive effect found by the present inventors with arginine analogs, such as N.sup..omega. -methyl-L-arginine, N.sup..omega. -amino-L-arginine or N.sup..omega. -nitro-L-arginine. These arginine analogs, otherwise described as nitric oxide synthase inhibitors, provide for a decrease in nitric oxide concentrations, and are demonstrated to elicit an increase in blood pressure in vivo, particularly in animals with cytokine and/or endotoxin induced hypotension. The parenteral formulation of the therapeutic regimen and methods of the invention are arginine-free and provide a decrease in plasma arginine levels. Reduced plasma and tissue levels of arginine in the animal function to augment the hypertensive action of arginine analogs to be administered concurrently or subsequent to administration of the parenteral formulation. This method provides a regiment for treating and/or inhibiting hypotension attendant a variety of conditions, including chemotherapeutic agent therapy (i.e., IFN, TNF), septic shock, trauma, exposure to endotoxins or cytokines, or other condition in which hypotension is attendant.

A gas-tight glass-metal composite layer is applied to the component and aged. The corroded part of the gas-tight layer is then removed and a second porous layer applied which can be made from a ceramic material in particular, an yttrium-stabilised zirconium oxide. The invention further relates to a thermal insulation layer which is made up of a sandwich of a gas-tight glass-metal composite layer and a superimposed further porous layer. As a result of the boundary volumes of the composite layer with the further layer being partly crystalline the adhesion within the sandwich is markedly improved with relation to the prior art. It is thus possible to produce a sandwich of silicate glass- metal composite layers and yttrium-stabilised zirconium oxide which is stable to heat over a long period of time. Such a sandwich is particularly useful for application as thermal insulation layer due to combining good oxidation protection with a low heat conductivity and low susceptibility to aging.",FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM JUELICH GMBH;;MACK DANIEL EMIL;;GROSS SONJA-MICHAELA;;VASSEN ROBERT;;STOEVER DETLEV,MACK DANIEL EMIL;;GROSS SONJA-MICHAELA;;VASSEN ROBERT;;STOEVER DETLEV,,https://lens.org/120-514-960-065-856,Patent Application,yes,4,3,8,8,0,C03C8/02;;C03C8/18;;C23C4/08;;F01D5/288;;F01D25/145;;F02C7/24;;F02K1/822;;F23M2900/05004;;F23R2900/00005;;F05D2300/2102;;F05D2300/603;;F05D2300/10;;C23C28/3215;;C23C28/345;;C23C28/3455;;C23C28/36;;C23C4/067;;Y10T428/249953;;Y02T50/60;;Y10T428/249953;;C03C8/02;;F02C7/24;;F01D5/288;;F23R2900/00005;;F02K1/822;;F01D25/145;;C03C8/18;;C23C4/08;;F23M2900/05004;;F05D2300/603;;F05D2300/2102;;F05D2300/10;;C23C28/36;;C23C28/345;;C23C28/3215;;C23C28/3455;;C23C4/067;;Y02T50/60,C23C4/06;;C23C28/00;;C23C4/08,,0,0,,,,PENDING

A gas-tight glass-metal composite layer is applied to the component and aged. The corroded part of the gas-tight layer is then removed and a second porous layer applied which can be made from a ceramic material in particular, an yttrium-stabilised zirconium oxide. The invention further relates to a thermal insulation layer which is made up of a sandwich of a gas-tight glass-metal composite layer and a superimposed further porous layer. As a result of the boundary volumes of the composite layer with the further layer being partly crystalline the adhesion within the sandwich is markedly improved with relation to the prior art. It is thus possible to produce a sandwich of silicate glass- metal composite layers and yttrium-stabilised zirconium oxide which is stable to heat over a long period of time. Such a sandwich is particularly useful for application as thermal insulation layer due to combining good oxidation protection with a low heat conductivity and low susceptibility to aging.",FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM JUELICH GMBH;;MACK DANIEL EMIL;;GROSS SONJA-MICHAELA;;VASSEN ROBERT;;STOEVER DETLEV,MACK DANIEL EMIL;;GROSS SONJA-MICHAELA;;VASSEN ROBERT;;STOEVER DETLEV,,https://lens.org/157-151-414-361-255,Search Report,yes,4,0,8,8,0,C03C8/02;;C03C8/18;;C23C4/08;;F01D5/288;;F01D25/145;;F02C7/24;;F02K1/822;;F23M2900/05004;;F23R2900/00005;;F05D2300/2102;;F05D2300/603;;F05D2300/10;;C23C28/3215;;C23C28/345;;C23C28/3455;;C23C28/36;;C23C4/067;;Y10T428/249953;;Y02T50/60;;Y10T428/249953;;C03C8/02;;F02C7/24;;F01D5/288;;F23R2900/00005;;F02K1/822;;F01D25/145;;C03C8/18;;C23C4/08;;F23M2900/05004;;F05D2300/603;;F05D2300/2102;;F05D2300/10;;C23C28/36;;C23C28/345;;C23C28/3215;;C23C28/3455;;C23C4/067;;Y02T50/60,C23C4/06;;C23C4/08;;C23C28/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

A gas-tight glass-metal composite coating is applied to the component and annealed. The corroded part of the gas-tight coating is then removed, and a second, porous coating is applied. The second coating can comprise a ceramic, in particular yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide. A thermal barrier coating is provided that is a composite made of a gas-tight glass-metal composite coating and another porous coating disposed thereover. Because the boundary volume of the composite coating is partly crystallized to the other coating, superior adhesion within the composite is achieved. Thus, it is in particular possible to produce a composite made of silicate glass-metal composite coatings and yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide that are temperature-stable for extended periods of time. Such a composite is particularly advantageous for use as a thermal barrier coating because it combines good protection against oxidation with low heat conductivity and susceptibility to aging.",MACK DANIEL EMIL;;GROSS SONJA-MICHAELA;;VASSEN ROBERT;;STOEVER DETLEV,MACK DANIEL EMIL;;GROSS SONJA-MICHAELA;;VASSEN ROBERT;;STOEVER DETLEV,FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM JUELICH GMBH (2008-04-23),https://lens.org/126-963-876-398-019,Patent Application,yes,4,6,8,8,0,C03C8/02;;C03C8/18;;C23C4/08;;F01D5/288;;F01D25/145;;F02C7/24;;F02K1/822;;F23M2900/05004;;F23R2900/00005;;F05D2300/2102;;F05D2300/603;;F05D2300/10;;C23C28/3215;;C23C28/345;;C23C28/3455;;C23C28/36;;C23C4/067;;Y10T428/249953;;Y02T50/60;;Y10T428/249953;;C03C8/02;;F02C7/24;;F01D5/288;;F23R2900/00005;;F02K1/822;;F01D25/145;;C03C8/18;;C23C4/08;;F23M2900/05004;;F05D2300/603;;F05D2300/2102;;F05D2300/10;;C23C28/36;;C23C28/345;;C23C28/3215;;C23C28/3455;;C23C4/067;;Y02T50/60,B32B3/26;;B05D3/12,428/304.4;;427/271,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

An iterative fixed-point reprojection algorithm is used to reproject the portions of the source image having depth values less than or equal to the insignificant parallax threshold depth. The fixed point reprojection algorithm quickly converges on the best pixel in the source image for each pixel in a target image representing an offset view of the source image.

A gas-tight glass-metal composite coating is applied to the component and annealed. The corroded part of the gas-tight coating is then removed, and a second, porous coating is applied. The second coating can comprise a ceramic, in particular yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide. A thermal barrier coating is provided that is a composite made of a gas-tight glass-metal composite coating and another porous coating disposed thereover. Because the boundary volume of the composite coating is partly crystallized to the other coating, superior adhesion within the composite is achieved. Thus, it is in particular possible to produce a composite made of silicate glass-metal composite coatings and yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide that are temperature-stable for extended periods of time. Such a composite is particularly advantageous for use as a thermal barrier coating because it combines good protection against oxidation with low heat conductivity and susceptibility to aging.",FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM JUELICH GMBH,MACK DANIEL EMIL;;GROSS SONJA-MICHAELA;;VASSEN ROBERT;;STOEVER DETLEV,FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM JUELICH GMBH (2008-04-23),https://lens.org/165-820-884-370-258,Granted Patent,yes,14,1,8,8,0,C03C8/02;;C03C8/18;;C23C4/08;;F01D5/288;;F01D25/145;;F02C7/24;;F02K1/822;;F23M2900/05004;;F23R2900/00005;;F05D2300/2102;;F05D2300/603;;F05D2300/10;;C23C28/3215;;C23C28/345;;C23C28/3455;;C23C28/36;;C23C4/067;;Y10T428/249953;;Y02T50/60;;Y10T428/249953;;C03C8/02;;F02C7/24;;F01D5/288;;F23R2900/00005;;F02K1/822;;F01D25/145;;C03C8/18;;C23C4/08;;F23M2900/05004;;F05D2300/603;;F05D2300/2102;;F05D2300/10;;C23C28/36;;C23C28/345;;C23C28/3215;;C23C28/3455;;C23C4/067;;Y02T50/60,B05D3/00;;B32B15/00;;B32B17/00,428/699;;428/304.4;;428/426;;428/432;;428/448;;428/450;;428/469;;428/472.2;;428/697;;428/701;;428/702;;427/264;;427/269;;427/270;;427/271;;427/283;;427/348;;427/372.2;;427/397.8;;427/419.1;;427/419.2;;427/419.6,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

   A process for selectively removing carbon dioxide from a gaseous stream by converting the carbon dioxide to a solid, stable form is provided. In a sequestration process, carbon dioxide enriched air is passed through a gas diffusion membrane to transfer the carbon dioxide to a fluid medium. The carbon dioxide rich fluid is then passed through a matrix containing a catalyst specific for carbon dioxide, which accelerates the conversion of the carbon dioxide to carbonic acid. In the final step, a mineral ion is added to the reaction so that a precipitate of carbonate salt is formed. This solid mineral precipitate can be safely stored for extended periods of time, such as by burying the precipitate in the ground or depositing the precipitate into storage sites either on land or into a body of water. An apparatus for removing carbon dioxide from a gaseous stream is also provided.

The activation arm can have a first arm, a second arm, which can be pivotally mounted to the first arm, and a roller (808) that can be coupled to the second arm. The driver can be disposed between the roller and the flywheel. The cam can be moveable in a predetermined direction for causing the activation arm to rotate about a pivot to drive the roller against the driver so that the driver frictionally engages the flywheel. The clutch can cooperate with the cam to inhibit the cam from moving in a direction opposite the predetermined direction in response to a reaction force that is applied by the driver onto the activation arm.

Before the slug rivet is upset and after the slug rivet has been snugly engaged by the riveting rams (50, 60), the pressure behind the riveting rams is equalized by introducing fluid into the cylinder (48) until the pressure within the cylinder (48) equals the pressure within the cylinder (56). This is to prevent movement of the workpiece at the commencement of the upsetting operation.",GEN ELECTRO MECH CORP,BIRKE JAMES L;;MICHALEWSKI DAVID;;GROSS STEVEN;;KELLNER ROBERT J;;ANDREWS MARK J,,https://lens.org/124-104-252-161-074,Patent Application,yes,2,3,3,3,0,B21J15/142;;B21J15/142;;B21J15/02;;B21J15/02;;B21J15/10;;B21J15/10;;B21J15/28;;B21J15/28;;Y10T29/49915;;Y10T29/49915;;Y10T29/49956;;Y10T29/49956;;Y10T29/5118;;Y10T29/5118;;Y10T29/5377;;Y10T29/5377,B21J15/02;;B21J15/10;;B21J15/28,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
