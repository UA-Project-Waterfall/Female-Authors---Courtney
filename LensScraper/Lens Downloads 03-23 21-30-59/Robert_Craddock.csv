This disclosure presents a new method for estimating hydrocarbon saturation directly from a porosity log and a total organic carbon (TOC) log. The method is enabled by the recent development of a geochemical spectroscopy logging tool that combines inelastic and capture gamma ray measurements to provide a robust and accurate TOC log. The method differs from the prior approach of using carbon-to-oxygen ratios that is most often applied in cased hole evaluation. The main advantages of this method are that it does not use knowledge of formation water resistivity, it does not rely on a resistivity model, it does not use an extensive calibration database, and it is largely independent of clay or other lithology effects. Here, the principles of the method and the main challenges are described, and calculations that explore uncertainties in the saturation estimates arising from uncertainties in the log inputs are presented. The statistical uncertainty in the estimate of hydrocarbon saturation is as good as 10 saturation units (s.u.) in conventional reservoirs with porosities of 15 porosity units (p.u.) or greater. The method has been applied to the determination of hydrocarbon saturation in a variety of formations, including bitumen-filled dolomite, heavy oil sand, and shaly-sands with both open hole and cased hole wells. The method works equally well in formations drilled and logged with either oil- and water-based mud. The saturation estimates have been benchmarked against a combination of conventional and new logging approaches (e.g., resistivity, magnetic resonance and dielectric logs) and core measurements, with generally excellent agreement among independent determinations. Hydrocarbon saturations can be determined accurately using the method in a number of formation types where conventional methods and models for estimating fluid saturation commonly fail, such as freshwater and unknown water salinity in formations under enhanced oil recovery. The case studies included herein demonstrate that a TOC log derived from geochemical spectroscopy logs can be used to obtain reliable estimates of hydrocarbon saturation in a wide range of environmental conditions and formations.",SCHLUMBERGER TECHNOLOGY CORP,HERRON MICHAEL M;;HERRON SUSAN;;GRAU JAMES A;;HORKOWITZ JOHN P;;CRADDOCK PAUL R;;BADRY ROBERT,SCHLUMBERGER TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION (2015-07-08),https://lens.org/146-672-641-647-303,Patent Application,yes,0,17,5,5,0,G01N33/246;;G01N33/246;;E21B49/00;;G01V5/101;;G01V11/00,E21B49/00;;G01V11/00;;G01V5/10,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Additionally new reservoir quality indices are presented that more accurately predict reservoir quality in tight oil plays.,SCHLUMBERGER TECHNOLOGY CORP,KADAYAM VISWANATHAN RAVINATH KAUSIK;;POMERANTZ ANDREW E;;LEWIS RICHARD;;CRADDOCK PAUL RYAN;;KLEINBERG ROBERT L;;SHRAY FRANK P;;REEDER BLANCO STACY LYNN,SCHLUMBERGER TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION (2014-10-29),https://lens.org/122-780-079-663-126,Granted Patent,yes,4,0,2,2,0,E21B49/00;;E21B49/00;;G01V11/00;;G01V11/00;;G01V3/30;;G01V3/30;;G01V3/32;;G01V3/32;;G01V99/00;;G01V99/00,E21B49/00;;G01V3/30;;G01V3/32;;G01V11/00;;G01V99/00,,4,1,023-803-877-146-019,10.2118/164554-ms,"Gonzalez et al., “Determination of Formation Organic Carbon content using a new Neutron Induced Gamma Ray Spectroscopy Service that directly measures carbon,” SPWLA 54th Annual Logging Symposium, Jun. 22-26, 2013 (10 pages).;;Rylander et al., NMR T2 Distributions in the Eagle Ford Shale: Reflections on Pore Size, SPE 164554, presentation at the unconventional resources conference, The woodlands, Texas USA, Apr. 10-12, 2013 (15 pages).;;Jarvie, D.
