A presente invenção refere-se a um novo processo de polimerização em alta temperatura que opera a altas pressões para a produção de um polímero. O processo inclui o transporte das misturas de reator híbrido, as quais incluem um ou mais monómeros de reator híbrido e um ou mais iniciadores de reator híbrido a um ou mais reatores híbridos. Os reatores híbridos são mantidos a temperaturas de polimerização híbridas e pressões padrão de polimerização de sub-refluxo eficazes para causar a polimerização de uma parte dos monómeros de reator híbrido no polímero. O processo inclui além disso o transporte do conteúdo do reator híbrido dos reatores híbridos a um ou mais reatores de batelada mantidos a temperaturas de polimerização de batelada e a pressões de polimerização de refluxo eficazes para causar a polimerização de uma parte restante dos monómeros de reator híbrido no polímero. Os reatores híbridos são menores em volume do que os reatores de batelada. Ao utilizar a combinação de reator híbrido/de batelada, o processo da presente invenção pode ser executado sob condições de operação seguras. O processo da presente invenção também permite o controle da polidispersão e do peso molecular dos polímeros resultantes. Em conseqüência disto, os polímeros produzidos dessa maneira podem ser usados como aglutinantes em composições, tais como as composições de revestimento usadas em reacabamento automotivo e aplicações de OEM que têm as propriedades de revestimento desejadas.

As a result, the polymers made therefrom can be used as binders in compositions, such as coating compositions used in the automotive refinish and OEM applications having desired coating properties. The present invention is also directed to a polymerization system used in the process of the present invention.

A blood flow characteristic for at least one point in the geometric model is automatically computed by inputting, into a trained machine-learning based model, a feature vector consisting of a numerical description of the geometry and estimates of patient physiological or phenotypic parameters. From its training, the trained model is configured to predict blood flow characteristics at points in geometrical models of anatomy from feature vectors of points in the geometric models (the feature vectors comprising a numerical description of the geometry at the point and estimates of physiological and phenotypic parameters of the individual). The parameters in the patient's feature vector correspond to the parameters in the feature vectors used to train the model.

With such specific information, each line or group of lines that needs to be moved or added to a new line terminating equipment are quickly identified and accomplished, thereby keeping service to the average customers at acceptable levels.

The injector also uses an improved mold clamp to secure and uniformly compress the two halves of the mold. The compressive force is applied via a pneumatically-operated piston attached to the clamp.

The molecular sieve material is considered to promote the wound healing by absorbing a matrix metaprotenase(MMP) from the wound body fluid.

The compressed digital signal is then sequentially written into successive locations in a random access memory (20). These locations are sequentially addressed at a later point in time to read the digitized information out of the memory on a time-delayed basis relative to when it was stored in the memory. The time delay is related to the anticipated reaction time it takes to cycle completely through all of the address locations in that portion of the memory being used to store the information.

   The present invention is directed to two component coating compositions that cure under ambient conditions and more particularly to those having low VOC (volatile organic content) that are suitable for use in automotive refinish and Original Equipment Manufacturing (OEM) applications. The coating composition includes crosslinkable and crosslinking components, wherein the crosslinkable component includes a low polydispersity, low molecular weight copolymer having on an average 2 to 25 functional groups, such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, acetoacetoxy, primary and secondary amine, and epoxy. The copolymer is polymerized from a monomer mixture that includes one or more non-functional acrylate monomers and one or more functional methacrylate monomers provided with the functional groups. The crosslinking component includes polyisocyanate, polyamine, ketimine, melamine, epoxy, polyacid or a combination thereof. The invention is also directed to coating produced from the coating composition.

Functionality at the client level monitors content being streamed and reports information about that content, together with user demographic information, to the integrating functionality, or when the user is not logged in stores it locally for later reporting. Other functionality at the client level allows the user to navigate the integrating functionality, logon, check incentive account status, update contact information, participate in redemption of rewards, and perform other activities.

The integrated circuit includes a functional path for the implementation of a functional specification as well as a testing path for testing the timing specifications for the integrated circuit. Input switching devices are connected between input terminals of the IC and inputs to sequential circuit elements, for example flip-flop devices, in the IC. Similarly, output switching devices are connected between outputs of the flip-flop devices and output terminals of the IC. The switching devices are selectively operable to alternately connect the flip-flop devices into either a functional IC path for providing functional output signals during functional cycles, or into a testing IC path for providing testing output signals indicative of timing points throughout the IC during testing cycles. The IC is also operable to selectively disable tristate bus drivers during the testing cycles. The switching devices are arranged such that a single output terminal of the IC may be selectively used to provide both functional and testing output signals.",MOTOROLA INC,GILES GRADY L;;CROUCH ALFRED LARRY;;AMASON JR ODIS DALE;;PRESSLY MATTHEW DONALD;;SHEPARD CLARK GILSON;;MATEJA MICHAEL ALAN;;CORLEY LEE ALLEN;;MARQUETTE DANIEL T;;DOEGE JASON E,FREESCALE SEMICONDUCTOR INC (2004-04-04);;MOTOROLA INC (1996-11-08),https://lens.org/144-466-055-717-321,Granted Patent,yes,8,139,1,1,0,G01R31/318572;;G01R31/31858;;G01R31/318572;;G01R31/31858,G01R31/3185,371/22.31;;395/182.06,4,0,,,"Test Compiler and Test Compiler Plus Ref.Manual, Version 3.0,Dec. 1992 pub. by Synopsys, Inc., I/O Port Requirements for Scan Implementation Styles , pp. 3 16 5 29.;;Edward J.
