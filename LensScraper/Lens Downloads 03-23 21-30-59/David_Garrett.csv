An FFT unit is typically implemented in an OFDM receiver to separate sub-carriers within a received OFDM signal. In general, an FFT unit implemented within an OFDM receiver must be designed to operate with a precision high enough such that quantization noise, introduced within the FFT unit, does not dominate the overall maximum SNR requirement of the system. However, the SNR requirement for many OFDM receivers is dynamic and, as a result, OFDM receivers often have an instantaneous SNR requirement far below the required maximum. In these situations, it would be advantageous to reduce the precision of datapath modules within the FFT to conserve power, which is often limited in wireless devices.

   A communication device comprising an ML-APP detector coupled to at least two antennas. The ML-APP detector comprises at least one Hx unit coupled to at least one LLR unit. The Hx unit generates a portion of all possible symbols that can be received and transfers each generated symbol candidate to the LLR unit which performs a conversion operation on the transferred symbol candidate to generate another symbol candidate that is not part of the special portion. In this manner all of the possible symbol candidates are obtained by the LLR unit. The LLR unit compares the symbol candidates to a received symbol to perform a cost calculation. The symbol candidate yielding the lowest cost from the cost calculations of all possible symbol candidates is selected as the best candidate. APP decoding is then performed on the selected candidate using soft information associated with the selected candidate which soft information is generated by the LLR unit.

An FFT unit is typically implemented in an OFDM receiver to separate sub-carriers within a received OFDM signal. In general, an FFT unit implemented within an OFDM receiver must be designed tooperate with a precision high enough such that quantization noise, introduced within the FFT unit, does not dominate the overall maximum SNR requirement of the system. However, the SNR requirement formany OFDM receivers is dynamic and, as a result, OFDM receivers often have an instantaneous SNR requirement far below the required maximum.

The Hx unit generates a portion, namely, a particular portion of all receivable symbols and transfers generated symbol candidates to the LLR unit, and the LLR unit converts the transferred symbol candidates to produce other symbol candidates which are not a portion of the particular portion. Thus, all the potential symbol candidates are obtained by the LLR unit. The LLR unit compares the symbol candidates with a received symbol to calculate costs. By calculating the costs of all the potential symbols, a symbol candidate which produces minimum costs is selected as a best candidate. Next, software information associated with the selected candidate is used for performing APP decoding onto the selected candidate.

A priori data input to the determination that are greater than or equal to a predetermined value are identified, and where such data is identified for any one time slice, that one time slice is removed from the determination. A quantizing function may be applied to the output extrinsic for each time slice. The quantizing function advantageously consists of a companding and flooring function. The quantized value is substituted for the output extrinsic value for that time slice.

Digital MEMS microphones utilize a modulation technique called Pulse Density Modulation (PDM), where a single data line (PDMDAT) is used to convey the digital information from the microphone source to a receiver. A characteristic of PDM is that a low noise signal will produce the most transitions, a zero signal will produce an alternating bitstream of logic-1s and logic-0s, and low noise bitstreams will be rich in singleton and doubleton 1s/0s. Typically, CMOS drivers transmit the PDM bitstream signal. CMOS drivers consume power primarily when they transition, so a bitstream rich in singletons and doubletons will increase power consumption. Differential encoding with an XNOR function is used as a singleton-suppression encoder, and a differential encoding with an XOR function is used as a doubleton-suppression encoder. In some embodiments, such as a dual PDM microphone configuration, the microphones alternate sending data on the rising (transition to logic-1) and falling (transition to logic-0) edges of PDMCLK.

A clock for a conventional PDM microphone (PDMCLK) is provided by another source. PDM microphones send serial data (PDMDAT) on the rising (“Right”) or falling (“Left”) edge of the PDMCLK clock, depending on how the microphone is configured. In a dual PDM microphone configuration, the microphones alternate sending data on the rising edges (transitions to logic-1) and falling edges (transitions to logic-0) of PDMCLK. Typically, Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) logic is used to transmit or drive the clock signal to the microphones. CMOS drivers consume power primarily when they transition from a logic-0 to a logic-1 or from a logic-1 to a logic-0. Thus, a free-running clock signal will produce the highest CMOS power consumption. In a dual PDM microphone system, it is desirable to operate in a low power mode with a single microphone at times and to operate with the full functionality (and power consumption) of both microphones at other times. In a conventional system, both PDM microphones share both the PDMDAT and PDMCLK signal lines. Thus both microphones must be clocked even if only one is being used. This wastes power in both the PDMCLK output buffer (driving both loads even if one is not being used) as well as in the unused microphone (where all of the clock circuits are active and switching). A novel PDM microphone interface is disclosed that provides a three signal interface comprising a separate PDMCLK signal to each microphone while maintaining a single common PDMDAT line.",SYNTIANT,CORDARO JOSEPH;;GARRETT DAVID,,https://lens.org/090-017-597-544-639,Patent Application,yes,0,0,1,1,0,H04R3/005;;H04R19/04;;H04R19/005;;H04R3/005;;G06F1/08;;H04R2201/003;;H04R19/04;;H03K3/037;;G06F1/12,H04R3/00;;G06F1/08;;G06F1/12;;H04R19/04,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Next, for each tile, a type of adjustment is determined and applied, including adjustment associated with Exposure, Brightness, Shadows, Highlights, Contrast, and Blackpoint. The adjustments are done for all tiles in the input image to render a small adjustment image. The small image is then interpolated, for example, using an edge-preserving interpolation, to get a full size adjustment image with adjustment curve for each pixel.

    A method and apparatus for compressing process fluids in a working chamber having a male and a female rotor, each supported by shafts in a first and a second bearing chamber maintained at low and high pressures at least equal to 90% of the low and high pressures in the working chamber, respectively. The compressor has a first pressurized lubrication reservoir connected to the first bearing chamber and a second pressurized lubrication reservoir connected to the second bearing chamber. The fluids in the working chamber, which may be corrosive, are kept out of the fluids in the bearing and gear chambers by labyrinth seals on the rotor shafts, the seals having grooves in communication with a pressurized buffer gas system. Leakage of buffer gas from the seals enters the bearing chambers and reservoirs, and is released from them at flow rates to control the bearing chamber pressures.

In an OFDM system, this corresponds to a certain set of subcarriers in the time/frequency arrangement. Thus, in the receive frame structure, the data and pilot subcarriers are guaranteed to be only noise and interference from adjacent sectors. The receiver can accurately measure the noise and interference without needing to cancel out the transmitted signal. Therefore, the system is assured that there is no desired signal as part of this measurement. The noise and interference measurement process can be appropriately scheduled so that it does not impact the overall throughput of the system.

The discharge circuit receives an image signal from the transmission line and transfers charge from the transmission line to the storage capacitor. In one embodiment, the discharge circuit includes a pair of opposed zener diodes. In response to a brief negative-going input pulse on the transmission line, the capacitor is discharged through the diodes. Then, the diodes recover and capacitor and column line are isolated from the tap. A selected line of an extraction grid is then activated to extract electrons from an emitter set coupled to the column line. The voltage differential between the extraction grid and the emitter set extracts electrons from the emitter set that are replaced by the capacitor. The capacitor has sufficient capacitance to supply electrons over an expected refresh interval of the column line. Therefore, the voltage of the capacitor remains substantially constant over the refresh interval.

The disc can be rotated about an axis normal to the yaw plane. A disc bump projects from both the upper and lower surfaces of the disc, and extends diametrically across it. When fluid is flowing through the exhaust duct, the bump, together with the opposing surfaces of the exhaust duct, chokes the flow and causes a sonic plane to be formed at the bump. The supersonic flow downstream of the disc bump remains approximately normal to the bump for angles of rotation of up to 20.degree. from normality between the bump and the upstream flow. Rotation of the disc thus causes deflection or turning of the fluid flow.

The transmitter schedules a transmission burst for a non-existent user (receiver) using wireless transmission traffic. In an OFDM system, this corresponds to a certain set of subcarriers in the time/frequency arrangement. Thus, in the receive frame structure, the data and pilot subcarriers are guaranteed to be only noise and interference from adjacent sectors. The receiver can accurately measure the noise and interference without needing to cancel out the transmitted signal. Therefore, the system is assured that there is no desired signal as part of this measurement. The noise and interference measurement process can be appropriately scheduled so that it does not impact the overall throughput of the system. This mechanism creates a deterministic place (in time and/or frequency) within the transmission, where no desired signal is required.",GARRETT DAVID;;LORENZ ROBERT;;TUJKOVIC DJORDJE,GARRETT DAVID;;LORENZ ROBERT;;TUJKOVIC DJORDJE,AVAGO TECHNOLOGIES GENERAL IP (SINGAPORE) PTE.

Separating mixed gases. BRITISH OXYGEN CO. Ltd. March 9,1965 [March 10,1964],No. 9956/64. Heading B1L. A gas mixture is passed through three adsorbers 1, 2 and 3 arranged in series and operating in a cycle of three periods, the adsorbers being transversed in the orders 123, 312, 231, and during each period the last adsorber, which becomes the first in the subsequent period, is maintained at a low temperature at which a constituent of the mixture is preferentially adsorbed. Any cold loss during regeneration is thereby minimised. The adsorbers are cooled by cooled return, gas fed through exchangers 15,16 and 17. During the first period the adsorber 1 is already at a low temperature from the previous period, adsorber 2 is warm, and adsorber 3 relatively cold. The impurities of the warm improve gas fed through line 13 to adsorber 1 are adsorbed, the gas cooling and the adsorber warming so that the impurities are concentrated at the end having the lower temperature and the warm adsorber desorbed. A plug of impurities formed at the adsorption front between the warmer and cooler parts reaches the lower end of adsorber 1, and then the gas carries the desorbed impurities over to the top of adsorber 2 so cooling the adsorber 2 which is then further cooled by means of its heat exchanger. Warm gas leaving 2 passes through valve 9 to adsorber 2 where it is cooled by heat exchanger 17. The first period ends when substantially all the impurities have passed from adsorber 1 into adsorber 2, the valves then being altered for the second period. The change over between periods is indicated either by a temperature sensing device or by an impurity sensing device. The impurities may be condensed and removed as liquid phase upstream of the second adsorber in any period, and the apparatus used continuously (Figs. 3 and 4, not shown) In a modification the second adsorber is bypassed during a final part of each period, the gas stream then passing directly from the first to the third adsorber.",BRITISH OXYGEN CO LTD,GARRETT MICHAEL ERNEST;;WEBBER DAVID ARTHUR,,https://lens.org/166-776-220-290-328,Granted Patent,no,0,0,4,4,0,B01D53/04;;B01D2256/18;;B01D2257/102;;B01D2259/403;;B01D2259/41;;F25J3/0276;;F25J3/028;;F25J3/029;;F25J3/04169;;F25J2205/40;;F25J2205/60;;F25J2215/34;;Y10S62/909;;F25J3/029;;F25J2205/40;;B01D2256/18;;F25J3/04169;;B01D2259/403;;F25J3/0276;;F25J3/028;;F25J2205/60;;F25J2215/34;;B01D53/04;;B01D2259/41;;B01D2257/102;;Y10S62/909,B01D53/04;;F25J3/02;;F25J3/08,B1L LBA           LBA;;B1L L102          LBA;;B1L L5B2          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The transmitter schedules a transmission burst for a non-existent user (receiver) using wireless transmission traffic. In an OFDM system, this corresponds to a certain set of subcarriers in the time/frequency arrangement. Thus, in the receive frame structure, the data and pilot subcarriers are guaranteed to be only noise and interference from adjacent sectors. The receiver can accurately measure the noise and interference without needing to cancel out the transmitted signal. Therefore, the system is assured that there is no desired signal as part of this measurement. The noise and interference measurement process can be appropriately scheduled so that it does not impact the overall throughput of the system. This mechanism creates a deterministic place (in time and/or frequency) within the transmission, where no desired signal is required.",BROADCOM CORP;;BROADCOM CORP,GARRETT DAVID;;LORENZ ROBERT;;TUJKOVIC DJORDJE,AVAGO TECHNOLOGIES GENERAL IP (SINGAPORE) PTE.

In one embodiment, the charging and clearing circuit is a single transistor coupled between a supply voltage and the storage circuit. The storage circuit is a single storage capacitor coupled between the transistor and the reference potential. In another embodiment, the charging and clearing circuit is formed from three transistors and an intermediate capacitor, and the storage circuit is formed from a storage capacitor and an output buffer. In either embodiment, pulses of an input voltage selectively charge the storage capacitor to a fixed voltage.

   In the multiplier, a partial product circuit generates a partial product based on a multiplicand operand and outputs of a Booth recoder circuit, which operates on a multiplier operand. The partial product circuit ANDs the multiplicand with a zero Booth recoded output, which indicates whether to zero out the multiplicand. An enable circuit selectively enables the multiplier circuit, and more particularly, disables the multiplier circuit by making the zero Booth recoded output indicate to zero out the multiplicand.

    Methods are provided for improving the efficiency of clock gating within low power clock trees. In a first aspect, a correlation level between a plurality of clock gating signals and their corresponding gates which gate a source clock is determined. The clock gating signals and their corresponding gates are combined into a single clock gating signal and a single corresponding gate if a preselected level of correlation exists therebetween. In a second aspect, an area overlap is determined for a plurality of sinks, and one of the gated drovers of the sinks is removed. The sinks of the removed gated driver then are connected to a remaining gated driver driven by a single clock gating signal and a single corresponding gate. In a third aspect, physically proximate sink clusters are rewired to generate a pure clock gating group within each sink cluster if rewiring the clusters increases wiring length by less than a predetermined amount. In a fourth aspect, a clock gating group is selected and the power dissipation is computed for all sinks within the selected group assuming all the sinks therein are wired without clock gating. The power dissipation also is computed assuming all the sinks therein are gated. If the power dissipation for all sinks within the selected group is reduced by individually wiring the sinks therein, the group is ungated. A computer program product also is provided having a computer readable medium with means for performing the first, second, third and/or fourth aspects of the invention.

This portion of the burr also presents a relatively shallow angle of attach to the vessel wall. A more aggressive or coarser abrasive is applied to portions of the burr disposed further from the vessel wall.

The upper and lower skins (51a, 51b) and the core (22) are pulled automatically through tooling (23) where the skin material is wetted-out with resin and the entire composite laminate (33) is preformed in nearly its final thickness. The preformed composite laminate continues to be pulled into an automatic 3-dimensional Z-axis fiber deposition machine (24) that deposits ""groupings of fiber filaments"" at multiple locations normal to the plane of the composite laminate structure and cuts each individual grouping such that a extension of each ""grouping of fiber filaments"" remains above the upper skin and below the lower skin. The preformed composite laminate then continues to be pulled into a secondary wet-out station (39). Next the preformed composite laminate travels into a pultrusion die (26) where the extended ""groupings of fiber filaments"" are all bent over above the top skin and below the bottom skin producing a superior clinched Z-axis fiber reinforcement as the composite laminate continues to be pulled, catalyzed, and cured at the back section of the pultrusion die. The composite laminate continues to be pulled by grippers that then feed it into a gantry CNC machine (36, 37) that is synchronous with the pull speed of the grippers (34, 35) and where computerized machining, drilling, and cutting operations take place.

SOLUTION: A heat pipe assembly is integrated thermally with an electronic module, generating heat, while the electronic module is arranged in a host structure. One series of heat pipe 18 is buried in the host structure and is supported by a core 24. The heat pipe 18 is enclosed in a retaining block 26, forming the channel 28, while the inside section of the channel 28 is slightly larger than the outside section of the heat pipe 18. When the heat pipe 18 is installed in the channel 28, a gap 30 remains between the outer surface of the heat pipe and the inner surface 32 of the channel 28.

    A method for making epothilones and epothilone analogs is described, as are novel compounds made by the method. One embodiment of the method was used to synthesize epothilone B by a convergent approach that entailed Wittig coupling of an ylide derived from phosphonium bromide with an aldehyde. The former was prepared from propargyl alcohol by a nine-step pathway which installed both trisubstituted double bonds with clean Z configuration. Macrolactonization of a resulting seco acid provided the following intermediate diene epothilone analog. Selective saturation of the 9,10-olefin and subsequent epoxidation provided epothilone B.

    A universal transaction machine (UTM) is disclosed, wherein a code symbol reader is integrated with a Java-enabled Internet terminal to enable the reading of a code symbol (e.g. magstripe or bar code) encoded with information related to a predetermined Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The predetermined URL specifies the location of a HTML-encoded document stored in an HTTP server and contains one or more transaction-enabling Java-Applets. When the URL-encoded symbol is read using the code symbol reader and provided to the Java-enabled browser program, the corresponding HTTP document is automatically accessed and displayed at the terminal. Preferably, the transaction-enabling Java-Applets are executed in order to produce a graphical user interface on the display screen of the terminal, thereby enabling the user to carry out data read and entry operations related to the prespecified information-related transaction. The transaction-enabling Internet terminal can be in the form of an Internet kiosk installed in a public location, in the manner as conventional ATMs. By virtue of the present invention, the universal transaction machine can be easily deployed for use by the mass population so that they can easily conduct various types of information-related transactions, including electronic-commerce, over the Internet.

The process is applicable to systems where inorganic materials are suspended in a slurry, using water as the suspending fluid, in the presence of a dispersing agent, as for example in the processing of kaolin clay where the crude clay is formed into an aqueous suspension for the purpose of removing impurities and further processing. Heat is applied to the fluids in or before entering the mixing zone of the mixer, in sufficient quantity to raise the temperature of the suspension by at least 10.degree. C. This lowers the flow resistance of fluids in the mixing zone. In consequence less energy is required per unit of material processed, and more material may be processed in a given mixing unit.

    A method for making epothilones and epothilone analogs is described, as are novel compounds made by the method. One embodiment of the method was used to synthesize epothilone B by a convergent approach that entailed Wittig coupling of an ylide derived from phosphonium bromide with an aldehyde. The former was prepared from propargyl alcohol by a nine-step pathway which installed both trisubstituted double bonds with clean Z configuration. Macrolactonization of a resulting seco acid provided the following intermediate diene epothilone analog. Selective saturation of the 9,10-olefin and subsequent epoxidation provided epothilone B.

    A method for making epothilones and epothilone analogs is described, as are novel compounds made by the method. One embodiment of the method was used to synthesize epothilone B by a convergent approach that entailed Wittig coupling of an ylide derived from phosphonium bromide with an aldehyde. The former was prepared from propargyl alcohol by a nine-step pathway which installed both trisubstituted double bonds with clean Z configuration. Macrolactonization of a resulting seco acid provided the following intermediate diene epothilone analog. Selective saturation of the 9,10-olefin and subsequent epoxidation provided epothilone B.
