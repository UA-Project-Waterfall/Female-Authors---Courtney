In particular, a digital electronic clipboard is used to mount pages or forms utilized in forms processing applications, such as inventory tracking. A stylus having a writing tip at one end of the stylus and a bar code scanning mechanism at another end of the stylus is used to enter data on the pages or forms and scan bar codes appearing on the pages or forms themselves, or on a separate item to be associated with the form. The system detects whether bar code data or stylus position data is being generated and causes its CPU to responsively process entered data. In an alternative embodiment, the system also permits generation of only one of stylus position data and bar code data at any given time. By providing a bar code scanner in the same implement as the stylus, the system permits a user to scan bar codes without having to replace the stylus or obtain a scanning implement; furthermore, scanning of a bar code on a preprinted form inherently provides a stream of stylus data with information to exactly reproduce a hardcopy form completed by the user, e.g., by combining an image of the preprinted form with entered stylus data.

The cross-linking agent is reacted with the functional groups in the soybean flour to form an adhesive resin. The present invention also relates to a method of making a soybean-based adhesive resin. This method involves providing an aqueous solution of soybean flour and adding a cross-linking agent to the solution under conditions effective to cross-link the soybean flour so that an adhesive resin is formed. Also disclosed is a composite product which includes particulate plant material and the soybean-based adhesive resin. The adhesive is prepared by reacting the cross-linking agent with the functional groups in the soybean flour. The present invention also relates to a method of making a composite product by providing particulate plant material and applying the soybean-based adhesive resin to the particulate plant material.

An outer ring is disposed about the inner ring and has an inner concave bearing surface disposed against the inner ring bearing surface. The two bearing surfaces are formed such that one bearing surfaces slides against the other when the movable member displaces about a first axis and two bearing surfaces engage to prevent displacement between the two rings when the movable member displaces about a second axis. An elastomeric bearing section is disposed about the plain bearing section, is connected with the second member and formed such that at least a portion of the elastomeric bearing section flexes when the movable member angularly displaces about the second axis.",SKF AB,RIEDL DANIEL L;;JAMES LESTER JOHN TEMPLE;;COLTON MICHAEL BRETT;;CURRY WILLIAM ANDREW,AKTIEBOLAGET SKF (2017-12-11),https://lens.org/048-174-480-983-546,Granted Patent,yes,13,0,6,6,0,F16C2326/43;;F16C11/083;;F16F1/393;;F16C27/063;;B64C27/35;;F16C27/066;;F16C33/306;;F16C27/063;;F16C17/03;;F16C27/08;;F16C33/1075;;F16C2326/43;;F16C11/083;;F16F1/393,F16C27/02;;B64C27/35;;F16C11/08;;F16C17/03;;F16C27/06;;F16C27/08;;F16C33/10;;F16C33/30;;F16F1/393,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

A laser source emits an optical signal and a RF waveform generator generates an input digital chirp signal based on the square wave digital chirp signal. A frequency of the optical signal is modulated based on the input digital chirp signal. A splitter divides the optical signal into a transmit optical signal and a reference optical signal. A detector combines the reference optical signal and a return optical signal from an object. The detector generates an electrical output signal based on the combined reference optical signal and the return optical signal. A processor determines a range to the object based on a characteristic of a Fourier transform the electrical output signal.

In a step of the method, the interconnect device assembly is placed in a fixture and the ends of the resilient wire bundles are deformed by shaping dies in the fixture so that the resilient wire bundles now have a dog bone shape. The dog bone shape of the resilient wire bundles prevents the resilient wire bundles from being partially or totally dislodged during handling and transit.
