There are large numbers of air conditioners and refrigerators still in use worldwide on refrigerant R134a which has substantial ozone depleting potential along with high global warming potential. As per the Montreal & Kyoto protocol, the conventional refrigerants are to be phased out ( Now all the CFCs and compounds such as Halons have been completely phased-out, while by 2030 almost all other ODSs will be phased out) and instead of that eco-friendly refrigeration / cooling systems are used in refrigeration and air conditioning appliances. The current invention relates generally to sound assisted cooling system and, more specifically, to optimization of sound assisted cooling system having a relatively small size which utilizes inert gas and different geometries of stack. Use one acoustic driver to generate high frequency sound within a resonator. The interaction of the high frequency sound with stack creates a temperature difference across the stack which is thermally anchored at each end to a pair of heat exchangers located on opposite sides of the stack. 5gr1 Figure1I",AWATE NILESH P DR;;BHAISWAR VINOD D MR;;DESHMUKH DHEERAJ S DR;;KHOND VIVEK W DR;;PITALE AMOL D MR;;RAUT ASHISH S DR;;SHELKE RUPESH S DR;;WALKE PRAMOD V DR,RAUT ASHISH S;;AWATE NILESH P;;PITALE AMOL D;;KHOND VIVEK W;;BHAISWAR VINOD D;;DESHMUKH DHEERAJ S;;WALKE PRAMOD V;;SHELKE RUPESH S,,https://lens.org/008-886-880-391-27X,Limited Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,F25B9/145;;F25B2309/1404;;B33Y80/00,F25B9/14;;B33Y80/00,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE
