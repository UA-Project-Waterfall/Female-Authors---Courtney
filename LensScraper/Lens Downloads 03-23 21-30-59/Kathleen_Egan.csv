   A computer system records, secures and retrieves a plurality of record of discussions (RODs). RODs are generally customer contacts or meeting minutes. A system database stores the plurality of RODs. Each ROD includes an information set to distinguish each ROD. Each information set comprises data blocks stored in data tables. The data blocks are each transferred for storage in a data table using web pages. At least one of the web pages includes a field to assign a ROD security designator. Each user is also assigned a security designator or is specifically designated by an access list to view a ROD. The web pages thereafter allow a user either having the appropriate security designator or who is named to a ROD's access list to search and view selected RODs. The computer system is connectable via a scalable Internet-based environment with users in multiple organizations.
