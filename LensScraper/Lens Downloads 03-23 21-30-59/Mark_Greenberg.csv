While a photolithographed array internal to the retina provides superior resolution, an array external to the retina provides easier implantation and improved manufacturability. Therefore it is advantageous to supply a high-resolution electrode array internal to the sclera, near the fovea and a lower-resolution electrode array external to the sclera near the periphery of the retina. The preferred method of manufacturing a high-resolution electrode array is through photolithography, which requires the array to be made flat. While it is possible to curve the array afterward, it is difficult and costly. I small high-resolution array can be implanted near the fovea. Due to its small size, curvature is less of an issue. A larger lower-resolution array can be molded in silicone or similar method and placed around the periphery, of the retina, where the retina is naturally lower resolution. Further, the lower-resolution array can be implanted external to the sclera reducing the number of electrical connectors passing through the sclera.

It is advantageous to supply a high-resolution electrode array (10) internal to the sclera, near the fovea and a lower-resolution electrode array (30) external to the sclera near the periphery of the retina. The preferred method of manufacturing a high-resolution electrode array (10) is through photolithography. A small high-resolution array (10) can be implanted near the fovea. Due to its small size, curvature is less of an issue. A larger lower-resolution array (30) can be moulded in silicone or similar method and placed around the periphery of the retina, where the retina is naturally lower resolution.

While a photolithographed array internal to the retina provides superior resolution, an array external to the retina provides easier implantation and improved manufacturability. Therefore it is advantageous to supply a high-resolution electrode array internal to the sclera, near the fovea and a lower-resolution electrode array external to the sclera near the periphery of the retina. The preferred method of manufacturing a high-resolution electrode array is through photolithography, which requires the array to be made flat. While it is possible to curve the array afterward, it is difficult and costly. I small high-resolution array can be implanted near the fovea. Due to its small size, curvature is less of an issue. A larger lower-resolution array can be molded in silicone or similar method and placed around the periphery, of the retina, where the retina is naturally lower resolution. Further, the lower-resolution array can be implanted external to the sclera reducing the number of electrical connectors passing through the sclera. Even if a separate lower-resolution array is implanted internal to the sclera, super-choroidal (between the choroid and sclera) or intra-scleral (between the layers of the sclera), it is easier to make a lower-resolution array in a curved shape.",SECOND SIGHT MEDICAL PROD INC;;GREENBERG ROBERT JAY;;HUMAYUN MARK,GREENBERG ROBERT JAY;;HUMAYUN MARK,,https://lens.org/097-925-669-664-508,Patent Application,yes,5,5,16,16,0,A61F9/08;;A61N1/36046;;A61N1/0543;;A61F9/08;;A61N1/36046;;A61N1/0543,A61B5/296;;A61N1/36;;A61F9/08;;A61N1/05,,1,1,029-598-504-167-296,3976803;;10.1016/0002-9394(85)90355-1,"E.

While a photolithographed array internal to the retina provides superior resolution, an array external to the retina provides easier implantation and improved manufacturability. Therefore it is advantageous to supply a high-resolution electrode array internal to the sclera, near the fovea and a lower-resolution electrode array external to the sclera near the periphery of the retina. The preferred method of manufacturing a high-resolution electrode array is through photolithography, which requires the array to be made flat. While it is possible to curve the array afterward, it is difficult and costly. I small high-resolution array can be implanted near the fovea. Due to its small size, curvature is less of an issue. A larger lower-resolution array can be molded in silicone or similar method and placed around the periphery, of the retina, where the retina is naturally lower resolution. Further, the lower-resolution array can be implanted external to the sclera reducing the number of electrical connectors passing through the sclera. Even if a separate lower-resolution array is implanted internal to the sclera, super-choroidal (between the choroid and sclera) or intra-scleral (between the layers of the sclera), it is easier to make a lower-resolution array in a curved shape.",SECOND SIGHT MEDICAL PROD INC;;GREENBERG ROBERT JAY;;HUMAYUN MARK,GREENBERG ROBERT JAY;;HUMAYUN MARK,,https://lens.org/002-333-319-230-659,Search Report,yes,3,0,16,16,0,A61F9/08;;A61N1/36046;;A61N1/0543;;A61F9/08;;A61N1/36046;;A61N1/0543,A61N1/36;;A61B5/296;;A61F9/08;;A61N1/05,,1,1,044-334-204-151-190,10.1016/s0924-4247(03)00292-9,"PARK D-S ET AL: ""A foveated-structure CMOS retina chip for edge detection with local light adaptation"", SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A, ELSEVIER SEQUOIA S.A., LAUSANNE, CH, vol. 108, no. 1-3, 15 November 2003 (2003-11-15), pages 75 - 80, XP004475525, ISSN: 0924-4247",PENDING

The preferred method of manufacturing a high-resolution electrode array (10) is through photolithography. A small high-resolution array (10) can be implanted near the fovea. Due to its small size, curvature is less of an issue. A larger lower-resolution array (30) can be moulded in silicone or similar method and placed around the periphery of the retina, where the retina is naturally lower resolution.

Therefore it is advantageous to supply a high-resolution electrode array internal to the sclera, near the fovea and a lower-resolution electrode array eternal to the sclera near the periphery of the retina. The preferred method of manufacturing a high-resolution electrode array is through photolithography, which requires the array to be made flat. While it is possible to curve the array afterward, it is difficult and costly. I small high-resolution array can be implanted near the fovea. Due to its small size, curvature is less of an issue. A larger lower-resolution array can be molded in silicone or similar method and placed around the periphery, of the retina, where the retina is naturally lower resolution. Further, the lower-resolution array can be implanted external to the sclera reducing the number of electrical connectors passing through the sclera. Even if a separate lower-resolution array is implanted internal to the sclera, super-choroidal (between the choroid and sclera) or intra-scleral (between the layers of the sclera), it is easier to make a lower-resolution array in a curved shape.",GREENBERG ROBERT J;;HUMAYUN MARK S,GREENBERG ROBERT J;;HUMAYUN MARK S,SECOND SIGHT MEDICAL PRODUCTS INC (2006-06-05);;DOHENY EYE INSTITUTE (2007-09-07),https://lens.org/016-374-625-417-779,Patent Application,yes,10,1,16,16,0,A61F9/08;;A61N1/36046;;A61N1/0543;;A61F9/08;;A61N1/36046;;A61N1/0543,A61B5/296;;A61N1/05,607/54,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

   The present invention is an implantable electrode array having electrodes with variable pitch and variable size. Electrode arrays of the prior art provide electrodes with a common spacing and size. However, this is not how the human body is arranged. As an example, the retina has closely spaced retinal receptors near the fovea. Those receptors are spaced farther apart, farther away from the fovea. Further, the amount of electrical current required to stimulate the perception of light increases with distance from the fovea. Hence, larger electrodes are required to transfer the necessary current farther away from the fovea.

The preferred method of manufacturing a high-resolution electrode array is through photolithography, which requires the array to be made flat. While it is possible to curve the array afterward, it is difficult and costly. I small high-resolution array can be implanted near the fovea. Due to its small size, curvature is less of an issue. A larger lower-resolution array can be molded in silicone or similar method and placed around the periphery, of the retina, where the retina is naturally lower resolution. Further, the lower-resolution array can be implanted external to the sclera reducing the number of electrical connectors passing through the sclera.

In an embodiment, collaborative ideas are represented in a modified tree data structure in which ideas are stored in nodes of the tree (an “idea tree”). Each node may be associated with data storage means, such as a table of records, in which different kinds of data can be stored. Data stored in the idea tree, or a part thereof, may be created, modified, deleted or organized by using various types of collaboration tools.

Images from a captured scene are analyzed to detect obstacles. A V-Disparity algorithm is employed to detect the ground plane and remove it from the images, thereby enhancing the capacity of retinal implants to display only obstacles. The system includes cameras to capture images; a processor with memory to detect obstacles in the captured images, to remove a ground plane, and to calculate a map of pixels representing the obstacles; and a retinal implant configured to receive the map of pixels and display the obstacles to a system user by electrically stimulating retinal nerves.

A UV light emitting device, such as a UV LED or laser diode (155, Fig 5) of the vehicle outputs UV light and is mounted such that the keypad indicia can be exposed to UV light, causing the keypad indicia to become readily visible by the human eye. An imaging device (160, Fig 5) of the vehicle captures user interaction with the keypad indicia while the keypad indicia is exposed to UV light. A keypad interaction processor determines if a sequence of body part movements with respect to the keypad indicia captured by the imaging device during exposure corresponds to an access code of the vehicle. The intensity of the light emitted can be varied based upon the ambient light level or solar intensity level. The imaging device can be a visible light camera.

They are particularly useful for retinal stimulation to create artificial vision, cochlear stimulation to create artificial hearing, or cortical stimulation many purposes. The pressure applied against the retina, or other neural tissue, by an electrode array is critical. Too little pressure causes increased electrical resistance, along with electric field dispersion. Too much pressure may block blood flow. Common flexible circuit fabrication techniques generally require that a flexible circuit electrode array be made flat. Since neural tissue is almost never flat, a flat array will necessarily apply uneven pressure. Further, the edges of a flexible circuit polymer array may be sharp and cut the delicate neural tissue. By applying the right amount of heat to a completed array, a curve can be induced. With a thermoplastic polymer it may be further advantageous to repeatedly heat the flexible circuit in multiple molds, each with a decreasing radius. Further, it is advantageous to add material along the edges. It is further advantageous to provide a fold or twist in the flexible circuit array. Additional material may be added inside and outside the fold to promote a good seal with tissue.

They are particularly useful for retinal stimulation to create artificial vision, cochlear stimulation to create artificial hearing, or cortical stimulation many purposes. The pressure applied against the retina, or other neural tissue, by an electrode array is critical. Too little pressure causes increased electrical resistance, along with electric field dispersion. Too much pressure may block blood flow. Common flexible circuit fabrication techniques generally require that a flexible circuit electrode array be made flat. Since neural tissue is almost never flat, a flat array will necessarily apply uneven pressure. Further, the edges of a flexible circuit polymer array may be sharp and cut the delicate neural tissue. By applying the right amount of heat to a completed array, a curve can be induced. With a thermoplastic polymer it may be further advantageous to repeatedly heat the flexible circuit in multiple molds, each with a decreasing radius. Further, it is advantageous to add material along the edges. It is further advantageous to provide a fold or twist in the flexible circuit array. Additional material may be added inside and outside the fold to promote a good seal with tissue.",GREENBERG ROBERT J;;TALBOT NEIL H;;NEYSMITH JORDAN;;LITTLE JAMES S;;MECH BRIAN V;;HUMAYUN MARK;;GUVEN DILEK;;RIPLEY ANN M D,GREENBERG ROBERT J;;TALBOT NEIL H;;NEYSMITH JORDAN;;LITTLE JAMES S;;MECH BRIAN V;;HUMAYUN MARK;;GUVEN DILEK;;RIPLEY ANN M D,CORTIGENT INC (2022-12-28);;SECOND SIGHT MEDICAL PRODUCTS INC (2006-05-22);;DOHENY EYE INSTITUTE (2007-09-07),https://lens.org/111-177-464-758-994,Patent Application,yes,17,38,21,90,0,A61N1/0541;;A61N1/0543;;A61N1/36046;;Y10T29/49124;;Y10T29/49124;;A61N1/0541;;A61N1/0543;;A61N1/36046;;H05K3/0011,A61N1/05,607/141;;607/116,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

They are particularly useful for retinal stimulation to create artificial vision, cochlear stimulation to create artificial hearing, or cortical stimulation many purposes. The pressure applied against the retina, or other neural tissue, by an electrode array is critical. Too little pressure causes increased electrical resistance, along with electric field dispersion. Too much pressure may block blood flow. Common flexible circuit fabrication techniques generally require that a flexible circuit electrode array be made flat. Since neural tissue is almost never flat, a flat array will necessarily apply uneven pressure. Further, the edges of a flexible circuit polymer array may be sharp and cut the delicate neural tissue. By applying the right amount of heat to a completed array, a curve can be induced. With a thermoplastic polymer it may be further advantageous to repeatedly heat the flexible circuit in multiple molds, each with a decreasing radius. Further, it is advantageous to add material along the edges. It is further advantageous to provide a fold or twist in the flexible circuit array. Additional material may be added inside and outside the fold to promote a good seal with tissue.",GREENBERG ROBERT JAY;;TALBOT NEIL HAMILTON;;NEYSMITH JORDAN MATTHEW;;LITTLE JAMES SINGLETON;;MECH BRIAN V;;HUMAYUN MARK;;GUVEN DILEK;;DE MERLIER RIPLEY ANNE-MARIE;;SECOND SIGHT MEDICAL PROD INC,GREENBERG ROBERT JAY;;TALBOT NEIL HAMILTON;;NEYSMITH JORDAN MATTHEW;;LITTLE JAMES SINGLETON;;MECH BRIAN V;;HUMAYUN MARK;;GUVEN DILEK;;DE MERLIER RIPLEY ANNE-MARIE,CORTIGENT INC (2022-12-28);;SECOND SIGHT MEDICAL PRODUCTS INC (2006-05-22);;DOHENY EYE INSTITUTE (2007-09-07),https://lens.org/090-168-866-261-45X,Granted Patent,yes,19,53,21,90,0,A61N1/0541;;A61N1/0543;;A61N1/36046;;Y10T29/49124;;Y10T29/49124;;A61N1/0541;;A61N1/0543;;A61N1/36046;;H05K3/0011,A61N1/05,607/53,2,2,179-087-728-571-452;;179-087-728-571-452,10.1109/t-ed.1982.20671;;10.1109/t-ed.1982.20671,"Shihab A.

They are particularly useful for retinal stimulation to create artificial vision, cochlear stimulation to create artificial hearing, or cortical stimulation many purposes. The pressure applied against the retina, or other neural tissue, by an electrode array is critical. Too little pressure causes increased electrical resistance, along with electric field dispersion. Too much pressure may block blood flow. Common flexible circuit fabrication techniques generally require that a flexible circuit electrode array be made flat. Since neural tissue is almost never flat, a flat array will necessarily apply uneven pressure. Further, the edges of a flexible circuit polymer array may be sharp and cut the delicate neural tissue. By applying the right amount of heat to a completed array, a curve can be induced. With a thermoplastic polymer it may be further advantageous to repeatedly heat the flexible circuit in multiple molds, each with a decreasing radius. Further, it is advantageous to add material along the edges. It is further advantageous to provide a fold or twist in the flexible circuit array. Additional material may be added inside and outside the fold to promote a good seal with tissue.",GREENBERG ROBERT J;;TALBOT NEIL H;;NEYSMITH JORDAN M;;LITTLE JAMES S;;MECH BRIAN V;;HUMAYUN MARK;;GUVEN DILEK;;DE MERLIER RIPLEY ANNE-MARIE,GREENBERG ROBERT J;;TALBOT NEIL H;;NEYSMITH JORDAN M;;LITTLE JAMES S;;MECH BRIAN V;;HUMAYUN MARK;;GUVEN DILEK;;DE MERLIER RIPLEY ANNE-MARIE,SECOND SIGHT MEDICAL PRODUCTS INC (2006-05-22);;DOHENY EYE INSTITUTE (2007-09-07),https://lens.org/033-249-997-774-084,Patent Application,yes,19,37,21,90,0,A61N1/0541;;A61N1/0543;;A61N1/36046;;Y10T29/49124;;Y10T29/49124;;A61N1/0541;;A61N1/0543;;A61N1/36046;;H05K3/0011,A61N1/04,600/395,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

In addition, with built-in transactional functionality, advertised Item(s) can be immediately purchased without having to exit the wrap.",WRAP MEDIA LLC,GREENBERG ERIC H;;GARRIS JOHN M;;MCFARLAND IAN;;STEVENS JON;;LI FRANCIS C;;LEVINE DANA A;;ROLSTON MARK E;;FICKLIN JARED L;;DROUIN SYLVIO H,BRUNOCO INC (2017-06-29);;WRAP MEDIA LLC (2015-11-10),https://lens.org/197-049-478-714-996,Granted Patent,yes,63,33,4,105,0,G06F3/0488;;G06F3/04842;;G06Q30/0643;;G06F16/958;;G06F3/0482;;G06Q30/0267;;G06F40/143;;G06Q30/0643;;G06F3/0481;;G06F16/958;;G06F3/0488;;G06F3/04842;;G06F40/106;;G06F40/117;;G06F40/186;;G06Q30/0267;;G06F40/143;;G06F3/0482,G06F17/00;;G06F3/0481;;G06F17/30;;G06F40/143;;G06Q30/06,,45,0,,,"PayPal Developer, ""PayPal Payments Advanced: Getting Started with Hosted Pages-PayPal Developer"", Apr. 4, 2012, PayPal, 4 pages + 1 Google Page showing on Google since Apr. 12, 2012; 5 pages total.;;UEN, ""Lists of RSS Feeds"", Apr. 6, 2012, UEN, 4 pages.;;DeMars, Jayson, ""The Definitive Guide to Using Twitter Cards"", Mar. 20, 2014, Forbes, 12 pages.;;Friendly Bit, ""Rendering a Web Page-Step by Step"", published on Jan. 11, 2010.;;Hegaret et al., ""What is the Document Object Model"", published on Nov. 7, 2003.;;GitHub, ""Reading & Writing JSON"", published on Oct. 6, 2013.;;Sarah Sluis, ""Harper's Bazaar Pursues Shoppable Ads With Streamwize"", http://adexchanger.com/publishers/harpers-bazaar-pursues-shoppable-ads-with-streamwize/, Jul. 24, 2014, downloaded on May 22, 2015.;;Paul Adams, ""The End of Apps as We Know Them"", https://blog.intercom.io/the-end-of-apps-as-we-know-them/, published around Nov. 2014, downloaded on May 22, 2015.;;Paul Adams, ""Why Cards are the Future of the Web"", https://blog.intercom.io/why-cards-are-the-future-of-the-web/, published around Sep. 2013, downloaded on May 22, 2015.;;Allison Schiff, ""Sharethrough Brings Its Version of Twitter Cards to the Masses"", http://adexchanger.com/native-advertising-2/sharethrough-brings-its-version-of-twitter-cards-to-the-masses/, Dec. 17, 2014, downloaded on May 26, 2015.;;Sarah Perez, ""Storytelling App Steller Becomes More of a Social Network"", http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/21/storytelling-app-steller-becomes-more-of-a-social-network/, Aug. 21, 2014, downloaded on May 26, 2015.;;Kaylene Hong, ""Steller is a Beautiful Visual Storytelling App, Similar to Storehouse, but for Your iPhone Instead"", http://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/03/13/steller-is-a-beautiful-visual-storytelling-app-similar-to-storehouse-but-for-your-iphone-instead/, Mar. 13, 2014, downloaded on May 27, 2015.;;Jayanth Prathipati, ""Why Do All Mobile Roads Lead Back to the Palm Pre?"", http://thetechblock.com/mobile-roads-lead-back-palm-pre/, published on Jun. 11, 2014, downloaded on May 27, 2015.;;Pictela, ""Introduction to Pictela"", http://www.pictela.com/docs/getting-started/introduction-to-pictela, from Wayback Machine indicating Wayback retrieval date of Mar. 18, 2015, downloaded on Jun. 5, 2015.
