Um invólucro de retenção (34, 36) é fixado por soldagem aos colares (12, 14) para envolver completamente uma seção da tubulação (10) entre os colares (12, 14). Uma máquina de afunilar (60) é então, de maneira removível, anexada a um topo aberto do invólucro de retenção (34). Usando a máquina de afunilar (60) um comprimento curto da tubulação (10) é cortado e removido dentre os colares (12, 14) deixando duas extremidades abertas da tubulação expostas (78, 80). Os primeiro e segundo elementos de vedação (92, 94) são posicionados entre os colares (12, 14), cada um tendo uma face de vedação contínua. Os elementos de vedação (92, 94) são forçados separados um do outro no engate de vedação com as faces de vedação do colar fechando desse modo as extremidades abertas, expostas (78, 80) do tubo (10).",TDW DELAWARE INC,CALKINS CHARLES DALE;;FREEMAN ERIC N;;GARRISON TONY R;;GOINS GARY D;;MORRISON PHILLIP K;;PUCKETT GREGORY L;;JACOB STEPHEN M;;MCDONALD BRYAN W;;MILLER JACK E,,https://lens.org/179-029-426-310-032,Patent Application,no,0,0,25,25,0,F16L41/06;;F16L55/105;;F16L55/124;;F16L55/18;;Y10T137/0458;;Y10T137/6123;;Y10T137/612;;F16L41/06;;F16L55/10;;F16L55/105;;F16L55/128;;Y10T137/0458;;Y10T137/6123;;Y10T137/612;;F16L41/06;;F16L55/124;;F16L55/18;;F16L55/105,F16L55/105,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
