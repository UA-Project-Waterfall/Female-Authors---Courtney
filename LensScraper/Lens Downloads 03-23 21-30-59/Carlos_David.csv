The isolation circuitry comprises a plurality of sub-circuits, with each sub-circuit comprising a capacitor, a first switch configured to provide a first connection between the capacitor and the power supply, a second switch configured to provide a second connection between the capacitor and the processing circuitry, and a third switch configured to provide a third connection across the capacitor to partially discharge the capacitor. Control circuitry controls the plurality of sub-circuits, such that within each sub-circuit the first switch, second switch and third switch are placed in an active state in a repeating sequence. Each of the plurality of sub-circuits further comprises a comparator configured to place the third switch in an open state when a predetermined non-zero voltage difference across the capacitor is reached during the active state of the third switch. By such an approach, it is ensured that the voltage across the comparator at the end of the discharge operation is always the same irrespective of the voltage present at the start of the discharge operation.

   A window has at least two surfaces oriented relative to each other at an angle greater than zero. A conductive path is disposed across the two surfaces and renders the window reflective or absorptive to a second predetermined bandwidth of energy, which can be radio frequency energy. The window utilizes window geometry, surface treatments, and bonding techniques to maintain electrical continuity across the surface. The window can be constructed from multiple segmented elements, such as sapphire, or from a unitary body. The window is transmissive to a desired wavelength of energy for the sensor while being reflective, refractive, or absorptive to a desired RF bandwidth of energy. The window provides RF signature management coupled with a substantial sensor Field of Regard and allows for full-time use of an embedded sensor.

Further mixing of the leach slurry in the presence of sodium, potassium, or ammonium will allow the formation of iron jarosite at ambient pressure.

    A hydrometallurgical process is provided for leaching nickeliferous laterite ores at temperatures below the boiling point of the pulp and at atmospheric pressure. The high iron fraction of the laterite, referred to as limonite, is first contacted with concentrated sulfuric acid to partially or completely dissolve the iron and nickel into solution. A reducing agent is used to keep the redox potential in solution below 1000 mV to enhance cobalt dissolution and more advantageously between 1000 and 900 mV to avoid reduction of ferric iron. Further mixing of the leach slurry in the presence of sodium, potassium, or ammonium allows formation of iron jarosite at ambient pressure. The resulting acid from iron hydrolysis is neutralized with the low iron fraction of the laterite ore (saprolite), thereby dissolving nickel into solution. The resulting final leach slurry can then be treated with conventional methods to recover nickel and cobalt from solution.

An interlock system protects the window by requiring that the window be retracted into the midgate panel before the midgate latches can be released for folding down the midgate panel. It also prevents the window from being actuated unless the midgate panel is latched closed. The interlock system prevents the optional pass through closure from being opened unless the window is fully closed and also prevents the window from being lowered if either pass through door closure is open.

Ademas, mezclar tambien la lechada lixiviante en presencia del sodio, potasio, o amonio permitira la formación de jarosita de hierro a presión ambiente. El acido resultante de la hidrólisis de hierro se neutraliza con la fracción de bajo contenido de hierro del mineral de laterita (saprolita) disolviendo el niquel en la solución. La lechada resultante puede entonces ser tratada con metodos convencionales para extraer níquel y cobalto de la solución. en solución .",BHP MINERALS INT INC,ARROYO J CARLOS;;NEUDORF DAVID A,,https://lens.org/031-067-349-102-490,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Um processo é fornecido para lixiviar minérios de laterita niquelíferos por métodos hidrometalúrgicos em temperaturas abaixo do ponto de ebulição da polpa e em pressão atmosférica da qual extrações de níquel e cobalto totais altas são obtidas. A fração alta de ferro da laterita, referida como limonita, é primeiro entrada em contato com um ácido mineral concentrado para parcialmente ou completamente dissolver o ferro e níquel em solução. Durante este processo, um agente redutor é usado para manter o potencial redox em solução abaixo de 1000 mV para acentuar dissolução de cobalto e mais vantajosamente entre 1000 e 900 mV para evitar redução de ferro férrico. Além disso mistura da pasta fluida de lixiviação na presença de sódio, potássio ou alumínio permitirá a formação de jarosita de ferro em pressão ambiente. O ácido resultante de hidrólise de ferro é neutralizado com a fração de baixo ferro do minério de laterita (saprolita) dissolvendo níquel em solução. A pasta fluida resultante pode ser então tratada com métodos convencionais para recuperar níquel e cobalto da solução.",BHP MINERALS INT INC,ARROYO J CARLOS;;NEUDORF DAVID A,,https://lens.org/099-687-899-220-138,Patent Application,no,0,0,23,23,0,C22B23/043;;C22B23/0461;;Y02P10/20;;C22B23/00;;C22B23/0461;;C22B23/043,C22B23/00;;C22B/;;C22B1/00;;C22B3/00;;C22B3/04;;C22B3/08;;C22B3/44;;C22B3/46;;C22B61/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Control circuitry controls the plurality of sub-circuits, such that within each sub-circuit the first switch, second switch and third switch are placed in an active state in a repeating sequence. Each of the plurality of sub-circuits further comprises a comparator configured to place the third switch in an open state when a predetermined non-zero voltage difference across the capacitor is reached during the active state of the third switch. By such an approach, it is ensured that the voltage across the comparator at the end of the discharge operation is always the same irrespective of the voltage present at the start of the discharge operation. As a result, the power consumption characteristic of the processing circuitry is entirely hidden by the isolation circuitry.

The high iron fraction of the laterite, referred to as limonite, is first contacted with a concentrated mineral acid to partially or completely dissolve the iron and nickel in solution. During this process, a reducing agent is used to keep the redox potential in solution below 1000 mV to enhance cobalt dissolution and more advantageously between 1000 and 900 mV to avoid reduction of ferric iron. Further mixing of the leach slurry in the presence of sodium, potassium, or ammonium will allow the formation of iron jarosite at ambient pressure. The resulting acid from iron hydrolysis is neutralized with the low iron fraction of the laterite ore (saprolite) dissolving nickel into solution.

The high iron fraction of the laterite, referred to as limonite, is first contacted with a concentrated mineral acid to partially or completely dissolve the iron and nickel in solution. During this process, a reducing agent is used to keep the redox potential in solution below 1000 mV to enhance cobalt dissolution and more advantageously between 1000 and 900 mV to avoid reduction of ferric iron. Further mixing of the leach slurry in the presence of sodium, potassium, or ammonium will allow the formation of iron jarosite at ambient pressure. The resulting acid from iron hydrolysis is neutralized with the low iron fraction of the laterite ore (saprolite) dissolving nickel into solution.

The isolation circuitry comprises a plurality of sub-circuits, with each sub-circuit comprising a capacitor, a first switch configured to provide a first connection between the capacitor and the power supply, a second switch configured to provide a second connection between the capacitor and the processing circuitry, and a third switch configured to provide a third connection across the capacitor to partially discharge the capacitor. Control circuitry controls the plurality of sub-circuits, such that within each sub-circuit the first switch, second switch and third switch are placed in an active state in a repeating sequence. Each of the plurality of sub-circuits further comprises a comparator configured to place the third switch in an open state when a predetermined non-zero voltage difference across the capacitor is reached during the active state of the third switch. By such an approach, it is ensured that the voltage across the comparator at the end of the discharge operation is always the same irrespective of the voltage present at the start of the discharge operation.

   A hydrometallurgical process is provided for leaching nickeliferous laterite ores at temperatures below the boiling point of the pulp and at atmospheric pressure. The high iron fraction of the laterite, referred to as limonite, is first contacted with concentrated sulfuric acid to partially or completely dissolve the iron and nickel into solution. A reducing agent is used to keep the redox potential in solution below 1000 mV to enhance cobalt dissolution and more advantageously between 1000 and 900 mV to avoid reduction of ferric iron. Further mixing of the leach slurry in the presence of sodium, potassium, or ammonium allows formation of iron jarosite at ambient pressure. The resulting acid from iron hydrolysis is neutralized with the low iron fraction of the laterite ore (saprolite), thereby dissolving nickel into solution. The resulting final leach slurry can then be treated with conventional methods to recover nickel and cobalt from solution.

Changes in input voltages induce currents in a first pair of field effect transistors (FETs) each having a gate coupled to the collector of a corresponding input transistor and a drain coupled to the emitter of the corresponding input transistor. Differential currents are provided to the output stage by a second pair of FETs, each configured to mirror the current in a corresponding one of the first pair of FETs. Gain is adjustable by enabling additional pairs of FETs configured as current mirrors. The output stage includes a second pair of bipolar transistors with bases coupled together and biased with equal currents. Currents from the input stage are applied to the emitters of the second pair of bipolar transistors. A third pair of FETs are coupled to the second pair of bipolar transistors forming a current mirror which tends to equalize the currents from the input stage. A current representative of a sum of currents from the input stage is forced through a resistor, forming the output voltage. The output voltage DC level is adjusted by controlling the voltage at the bases of the second pair of bipolar transistors.",MICRO LINEAR CORP,ZUCKER ROBERT;;LABER CARLOS A;;RITTER DAVID,FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION (2000-11-20);;MICRO LINEAR CORPORATION (1998-12-21),https://lens.org/076-770-863-022-132,Granted Patent,yes,16,22,1,1,0,H03F3/45179;;H03F3/45179;;H03F3/3008;;H03F3/3008;;H03F3/45098;;H03F3/45098;;H03F3/45475;;H03F3/45475;;H03F2200/72;;H03F2200/72,H03F3/30;;H03F3/45,330/301;;330/295;;330/300,2,1,095-625-374-674-015,10.1109/jssc.1987.1052700,"Gray, Paul R., and Meyer, Robert G., Analysis and Design of Analog Integrated Circuits , Third Ed., 1993, pp. 471 472.;;Laber, et al., Design Considerations for a High Performance 3 um CMOS Analog Standard Cell Library, IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, vol.

An oscillating signal is provided to the transmitter, which causes eddy currents to flow in a surrounding formation. The magnitudes of the eddy currents are proportional to the conductivity of the formation. The eddy currents in turn induce voltages in the receivers. The received voltages are digitized at a sampling rate well above the maximum frequency of interest. The digitizing window is synchronized to a cycle of the oscillating current signal. Corresponding samples obtained in each cycle are cumulatively summed over a large number of such cycles. The summed samples form a stacked signal. Stacked signals generated for corresponding receiver coils are transmitted to a computer for spectral analysis. Transmitting the stacked signals and not all the individually sampled signals, reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored or transmitted. A Fourier analysis is performed on the stacked signals to derive the amplitudes of in-phase and quadrature components of the receiver voltages at the frequencies of interest.

    A floating interface assembly provides signal paths between an integrated circuit (IC) test head and contact pads on a load board or probe card accessing an IC to be tested. Pogo pins or other contactors for contacting the contact pads are mounted on the interface assembly and linked to the test head by flexible conductors. The interface assembly is attached to the test head by springs to allow it the freedom to rotate to some extent about any axis. As the test head approaches the contact pads, alignment pins engage and orient the interface assembly so that its contactors will mate with the contact pads. As the contactors come into contact with the contact pads, the interface assembly adjusts the plane of the contactors so as to evenly distribute contact pressure over all contactor pads.

The modified digital mini-microscope comprises an electronic card (1), an optical sensor (2), a spacer (3), a lens or objective lens (4), a lighting device (5), a flat glass located before the aperture of the lens (4) and covered with a protective film (7). All these components are assembled inside a casing (1) that is resistant to impacts, hermetically sealed and ergonomically shaped. The non-invasive method for determining the density of ducts and fibres in the skin of living animals comprises four main steps: (a) preparing the camelid skin and fibres for data collection (9); (b) calibrating the area of the image to be captured (10); (c) amplified capture and storage of images of the skin and fibres of the living animal (11); and (d) processing the images and displaying them on a visualisation interface (12). The present invention makes it possible to obtain the following characteristics: average and standard deviation of fibre density/mm2; average and standard deviation of duct density/mm2; number of fibres/number of ducts ratio. In addition, the method also determines the characteristics of the tufts of fibres by the number of fibres they contain. These results can be used to characterise and evaluate animals, thus providing new selection criteria measured directly and objectively for use in the genetic improvement of the animals.",QUISPE PENA EDGAR CARLOS;;QUISPE BONILLA MAX DAVID,QUISPE PEÑA EDGAR CARLOS;;QUISPE BONILLA MAX DAVID,,https://lens.org/135-286-341-010-381,Patent Application,yes,6,0,1,1,0,G01B11/14;;G01N21/84,G01B11/14;;G01N21/84,,0,0,,,,PENDING

For this purpose, the operation of the device includes: activation of the device; preparation of samples; rapid calibration with a standard sample having an average diameter between 17 and 19 microns; evaluation of the sample; viewing of the results; and production of reports on the measurements. The improvements to the state of the art are based on: the portability of the device (smaller and lighter); specificity for measuring determined thick and fine fibres; potential for measuring samples of slightly disaggregated fibres; sharp display of images of the fibres, which are measured in real time, owing to interaction of the components of the device, such as a high-speed image detector, an image detector shutter, a lens and a manual focusing screw, as well as the production of results in digital and print format. Also described is the preparation of samples under field conditions, allowing the device to be used in field conditions. An additional particularity of the device is the ability to measure thick fibres (hairs) automatically, precisely and exactly, owing to the implementation of rapid calibration with a standard sample with diameter ranges between 60 and 80 microns.",QUISPE PENA EDGAR CARLOS;;QUISPE BONILLA MAX DAVID,QUISPE PENA EDGAR CARLOS;;QUISPE BONILLA MAX DAVID,,https://lens.org/188-795-866-374-602,Patent Application,no,0,0,4,4,0,G01B11/06;;G01B11/08;;G01B21/10;;G01N21/84,G01B11/08;;G01B11/06;;G01B21/10;;G01N21/84,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
