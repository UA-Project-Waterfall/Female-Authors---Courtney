A system identifies a characteristic of a physical object that is located on a physical surface. The system obtains, based on the characteristic, information indicative of a rule set for the game and a state of the game based on the characteristic. A game engine is initialized based on the rule set and game state. The game engine generates a subsequent state for the game.
