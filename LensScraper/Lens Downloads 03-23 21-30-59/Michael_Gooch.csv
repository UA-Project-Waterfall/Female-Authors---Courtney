Las partículas indicadoras, como las nanopartículas activas de espectroscopía Raman mejorada en la superficie (SERS), cada una de las cuales se ha asociado con uno o más miembros de unión específicos que tienen una afinidad por uno o más microorganismos de interés, puede formar un complejo con microorganismos específicos en la muestra de cultivo.

The basket is provided between the open port and the closed port of the vessel. The water storage vessel is configured to have a volume of a culture specimen therein. The lid is fitted together with at least one needle assembly which is provided with needles which extend in the water storage vessel. The needles are configured to selectively remove a specimen included in the water storage vessel. The needle is a tube for measuring a prescribed amount of specimens further configured for biologically encapsulated transfer of the specimen from the water storage vessel to the vial so as to fit the vial.SELECTED DRAWING: Figure 1,BECTON DICKINSON CO,KRISTIN WEIDEMAIER;;CAMPBELL ROBERT L;;ERIN GOOCH CARRUTHERS;;ADAM C CURRY;;KEVIN G DOLAN;;ANDREA LIEBMANN-VINSON;;WENDY DALE WOODLEY;;MELODY M H KURODA;;DAVID AMMON LENTZ;;DWIGHT LIVINGSTON;;MICHAEL JUSTIN LIZZI;;ARTIS R LOCKHART;;ERNIE RITCHEY;;ERIC A FALLOWS;;DONALD E GORELICK;;JACK KESSLER;;SPENCER LOVETTE;;JEFFREY S OJALA;;MARK A TALMER;;MIROSLAW BARTKOWIAK;;SCOTT N DANHOF;;GREGORY S KRAMER;;THOMAS D HAUBERT;;MICHAEL L MARSHALL;;JAMES A PRESCOTT;;RANDY J SOMERVILLE;;M SCOTT ULRICH;;DAVID S SEBBA,,https://lens.org/144-027-800-297-423,Patent Application,no,5,0,37,37,0,B03C1/01;;B03C1/288;;C12M23/08;;C12M23/22;;C12M23/38;;C12M33/04;;C12M41/14;;G01N33/56911;;G01N35/0098;;B03C2201/26;;G01N33/56911;;C12M23/38;;C12M33/04;;C12M23/08;;C12M23/22;;C12M41/14;;G01N35/0098;;B03C1/01;;B03C1/288;;B03C2201/26;;C12M41/36;;G01N35/0098;;B03C1/01;;B03C1/288;;B03C2201/26;;G01N33/56911;;C12M23/38;;C12M33/04;;C12M23/08;;C12M23/22;;C12M41/14;;B01L3/0217;;B01L3/502;;B01L3/50825;;B01L2200/026;;B01L2200/0605;;B01L2200/10;;G01N33/54333,C12M1/28;;C12M1/34,,1,0,,,"BIOFOULING, 1991, 5(1/2):143-155, JPN6016050535, ISSN: 0003940868",ACTIVE
