Evans, J., and Evans, E. R. Feb. 18. Cutting and slicing vegetables &c.-A slicing- machine for meat &c. comprises a vertical reciprocating knife and an horizontal reciprocating support provided with means for feeding the meat towards the knife. Figs. 1 and 2 show one construction of a double-acting machine. A double-edged vertical-blade knife 19 is fixed to a guided block, which is reciprocated by a crank-pin engaging the slot 18. The upper end of the knife-blade is slotted to engage the guidepin 21, and the cutting-edges preferably converge towards the base so that the blade cuts only on the down-stroke. A second crank-pin 13 mounted on an horizontal spur-wheel engages lateral guides 15 on the support 20, which is thus reciprocated with a harmonic motion on rollers 22 on a track in the framing. The knife and support are geared up to the main spindle 1 so that the knife makes several reciprocations to each stroke of the support. At the end of each stroke of the support, a spring-controlled lever 45 mounted thereon strikes one of the pins 17, and thereby operates the pawl of the feeding-mechanism to which the end 48 of the lever is connected. The feeding-mechanism moves the table 25 in guides at right-angles to the stroke of the support 20. The pins 17 are adjusted to vary the thickness of the slice by the rods 31, 33. A platform 'or receiver for the cut slices. may be arranged in the projections 40, and may be provided with guard-plates overlapping the cutting-edges of the knife.",EVANS JAMES;;EVANS EMMA KATE,EVANS JAMES;;EVANS EMMA KATE,,https://lens.org/137-929-391-992-474,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,B26D1/10,B26D1/10,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The raised V-shaped structure has an open medial channel which enables the platforms to act as cradle members to engage opposite sides of a watercraft, as the watercraft to be docked is maneuvered into the open medial channel bow first. As the watercraft advances from the rear to the front of the dock, along the long axis of the base, the bow rests upon and is elevated by the incline of the platforms. The weight of the watercraft, as it rests upon the platforms, serves to anchor the dock to the bottom of the lake bed, thereby rendering both the watercraft and the dock stationary. The invention may be easily placed into the body of water and removed therefrom by hand, as it is of such a size and weight so as to allow easy manual transport. The invention enables watercraft such as boats, jet skis, and the like to be ""docked"" or rendered stationary in shallow water areas along shorelines.

The term fibres includes continuous filaments. The tangle laced areas are defined as having an ""impenetrability rating"" (as defined in the Specification) of at least 0.5 and the fabric produced must have a ""structural measure of fibre entanglement and cooperation"" (as defined in the Specification) of at least 0.1. Where secondary fibres emanate in bundles from opposite side of the tanglelaced areas a further factor, ""rub strength ratio"" is applicable as a criterion the value of which must be at least 0.7. The products of the invention may comprise two or more strata in which the pattern of primary areas and secondary fibres differ, and this effect may be achieved by the use of a patterning support member the face of which is non planar, or which has planar and non planar areas, e.g. a plate having apertures and upstanding pins or pyramids. The fibres selected may desirably have the property of crimping, elongating or shrinking when the fabric is subjected to an appropriate after-treatment and are initially laid in the web in random or oriented relation e.g. by carding, air deposition or slurry deposition. The initial mat may be cross-lapped and may include a scrim fabric as a reinforcing layer or a layer of yarns all laid in one direction, e.g. as warp yarns (Example XXX). A paper web of short cellulosic fibres (Example XIII) or of synthetic fibres (Example XIV) may be laid on a fibrous web and incorporated into the tanglelaced product by the process of the invention. The patterning member may have apertures of various forms or merely recesses, protrusions and grooves and may consist of a woven wire screen, perforated plate or the like. Contoured patterning members may be used for the direct formation of garments. The materials produced may be dried on the patterning member and subsequently dyed, printed, heat treated, treated with resins, binders, sizes, finishes, surface-coated and/or pressed, embossed or laminated with other materials such as foils, films or the like. The high impact pressure jets are normally emitted from nozzles placed a few inches from the fibrous web but the nozzles may be arranged to contact the surface thereof. The jets may not necessarily be arranged at right angles to the surface and may be arranged to oscillate and to traverse the web surface repeatedly, if desired at increasing pressures. To increase fibre mobility and thus also the ease of producing the tanglelaced areas the fibrous web may be treated first with a wetting agent. Specific fibres referred to include polyethylene terephthalate in staple or continuous form, isotactic polyproplene, acrylic and polyacrylic fibres, cotton, rayon, short cellulosic fibres, hydroxypivalic acid fibres, steel wool and wool. Two-component fibres of trilobal cross-section and containing polyethylene terephthalate and polyhexamethylene adipamide or of ribbon-like cross-section with the same components in side by side relation are referred to as are also two-component fibres containing polyhexamethylene adipamide with polycaproamide and polyhexamethylene adipamide with a copolyamide of hexamethylene adipamide and hexamethylene sebacamide. Heat setting of the patterned fabrics, if desired under pressure, may be employed. In Ex. IX a post-treatment comprising sanding the surfaces of the fabric with emery paper, clipping the raised fibres and consolidating under heat and pressure to provide a flannel-like fabric is referred to. In Ex. XI the use of an acrylic resin as a binder is referred to. The products of the invention are of use in upholstery, drapery, clothing and as diapers, bandages, blankets and reinforcements for rubber goods such as tyres, conveyor belts and the like.",DU PONT,EVANS FRANKLIN JAMES,,https://lens.org/119-310-635-674-391,Granted Patent,no,0,18,3,3,0,D04H18/04;;D04H1/492;;D04H1/50;;D04H3/007;;D04H3/011;;D04H3/11,D04H1/492;;D04H1/50;;D04H3/007;;D04H3/011;;D04H3/11,B5S S17Y;;B5S S17Y;;B5S S177;;B5S S178;;B5S S22Y;;B5S S22Y;;B5S S227;;B5S S228;;B5S S235;;B5S S236;;B5S S238;;B5S S239;;B5S S242;;B5S S25X;;B5S S25X;;B5S S250;;B5S S250;;B5S S252;;B5S S252;;B5S S27X;;B5S S27X;;B5S S270;;B5S S270;;B5S S344;;B5S S344;;B5S S345;;B5S S345;;B5S S346;;B5S S346;;B5S S348;;B5S S348;;B5S S349;;B5S S349;;B5S S35X;;B5S S35X;;B5S S35Y;;B5S S35Y;;B5S S350;;B5S S350;;B5S S353;;B5S S353;;B5S S354;;B5S S354;;B5S S355;;B5S S355;;B5S S423;;B5S S423;;B5S S424;;B5S S424;;B5S S436;;B5S S436;;B5S S438;;B5S S438;;B5S S565;;B5S S565;;B5S S567;;B5S S567;;B5S S568;;B5S S568;;B5S S569;;B5S S569;;B5S S57X;;B5S S57X;;B5S S591;;B5S S591;;B5S S609;;B5S S609;;B5S S61Y;;B5S S61Y;;B5S S62Y;;B5S S62Y;;B5S S620;;B5S S620;;B5S S653;;B5S S653;;B5S S656;;B5S S656;;B5S S658;;B5S S658;;B5S S66X;;B5S S66X;;B5S S66Y;;B5S S66Y;;B5S S661;;B5S S661;;B5S S67X;;B5S S67X;;B5S S670;;B5S S670;;B5S S679,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

DISTILLERS CO. Ltd. March 4, 1960 [March 7, 1959], No. 7967/59. Class 38 (4). [Also in Group XXVIII] Vaporizing apparatus for a readily vaporizable liquid such as liquid carbon dioxide or liquid petroleum gases comprises a heating vessel 1 having an inlet port 2 for connection to a storage tank containing the vaporizable liquid and an outlet port 4 for connection to a gas delivery pipe 5, the heating vessel containing three heating elements 7, 8, 9 with an associated temperature responsive device 10, 11, 12 respectively, the temperature responsive devices controlling the supply to the heating elements. Whilst the vaporizer is idle, the liquid vaporizes until the liquid pressure is balanced by the gas pressure in the vessel 1. Opening of a valve 6 allows the gas to be used with a consequent further generation of gas in the vessel 1 with a concomitant drop in the temperature in the vessel. The passage of the liquid through the inlet port 2 causes a temperature responsive device to operate to close a switch 17 whereby the electric supply circuit is closed. The drop of temperature in the vessel 1 causes the temperature responsive devices 10, 11, 12 to operate in succession to close switches 13, 14, 15 respectively so that the heating elements 7, 8, 9 maintain the supply of gas. As the demand for gas diminishes, the temperature at the top of the vessel rises, whereupon the temperature responsive device 12 causes the heating element 9 to be switched off. A further reduction in demand will cause the heating element 8 to be switched off and so on. Other temperature responsive devices, to control the heating elements, may be placed in the delivery pipe 5. A fusible link 26 is provided adjacent the vessel 1 which link ruptures should the temperature of the vessel rise above a predetermined limit, whereupon a switch 25 opens to remove the electric supply from the apparatus. The heating means may be other than electric, such as for example, steam.",DISTILLERS CO YEAST LTD,EVANS ARTHUR JAMES,,https://lens.org/053-560-935-742-236,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,B01D3/4211,B01D3/42,F4P PEB           PEB;;F4P P855          PEB;;F4P P856          PEB;;F4P P857          PEB;;G3R RBQ59         BQ59;;G3R RB4723        BQ59;;G3R RB4724        BQ59,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The armature has two or more electrically conducting solid parts 10 in contact with the rails 11. Electric current flows from the rails to and from the armature between the adjacent rail and armature surfaces 14 and across the or each gap 12 by electric arcing between the conducting solid parts 10. The resulting electromagnetic forces on the armature accelerate it and any attached projectile along the rails. A member of insulating or high resistivity material located forward of the armature closes the or each gap 12 to confine the electric arcing across the smallest gap spacing to minimise the arc voltage and armature resistive losses. Exhaust chambers for the confinement and/or cooling of arcing erosion products are provided at the rear of the armature. <IMAGE>,JAMES TREVOR EVANS,JAMES TREVOR EVANS,,https://lens.org/123-461-048-469-361,Patent Application,no,1,1,2,2,0,F41B6/006,F41B6/00,F3C CFK           CFK,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   A method and software construct is presented for creating message-oriented middleware adapters utilizing predefined communication paradigms. The communication paradigm defines the communication between an initiator application and a respondent application during an overall exchange of data. The communication paradigm is then used to create an instance of an adapter core for either the initiator or the respondent application. The adapter core contains communication components that handle all communications in the paradigm. The present invention predefines a point-to-point paradigm and a publish-and-subscribe paradigm, and the adapters needed for these paradigms. Starting from these two basic paradigms, it is possible to create an infinite number of more complex paradigms, with each of these complex paradigms being formed from a combination of the basic paradigms or other previously defined paradigms. The present invention creates adapters for a newly defined paradigm by combining the adapters defined in the nested paradigms that make up the paradigm definition.

The architecture for this digital portable telephone provides improved performance over that of other digital portable telephones by combining the frequency hopping spread spectrum technique with other spread spectrum techniques in communications between the handset unit and the base unit. Specifically, delta modulation and a redundant transmission of the signal are the other forms of signal spreading that are employed. Such signal spreading advantageously achieves additional processing gain. Another attractive attribute of this architecture is a high level of immunity to interference from other portable telephones also operating in the same frequency hopping band. Finally, the circuit architecture is simplified and the cost for a portable telephone employing simplified circuits is less than a portable telephone employing circuitry required to switch between transmit and receive states while frequency hopping in a frequency hopping system.",LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES INC,EVANS JAMES GIFFORD,WSOU INVESTMENTS LLC (2017-07-22);;LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES INC (1998-05-13),https://lens.org/062-711-898-520-491,Granted Patent,yes,17,15,1,1,0,H04B1/7136;;H04B1/7136;;H04B1/405;;H04B1/405;;H04L1/04;;H04L1/04,H04B1/40;;H04B1/7136;;H04L1/04,375/133;;455/426;;455/462;;455/464;;455/465,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The improved arrangement and method also have the further capability of resolving individual orders of distortion products. The arrangement utilizes a noise signal generator that produces a pseudorandom signal made of several spectral components providing high spectral density throughout a large bandwidth to simulate a broadband message load obtained by frequency multiplexing several independent signal sources. The noise signal is shifted in frequency before a quiet band is produced in the signal applied to the transmission apparatus to be tested. The orders of intermodulation distortion products appearing in the quiet band of the output signal of the transmission apparatus are individually measured to evaluate same. Automation of the test sequence is provided by a computer which acts as a general controller.

Modern MCUs desirably produce a different video composition for each participant. Furthermore, endpoints increasingly provide high definition display capability. These factors mean that the processing requirements of MCUs and the internal data bandwidth requirements are increasing at a dramatic rate. Present MCUs do not have either the processing capability or internal bandwidth availability to meet these demands. By using high bandwidth internal links and producing an architecture with few bottlenecks, many of these problems are alleviated. Furthermore by processing the data internally using intelligent multicasting decisions, intelligent scaling and compression decisions and acknowledging that the video data may be compressed without loss of visual quality, the processing and bandwidth requirements may be met. This may be achieved by mounting a plurality of processing means 28 on a daughterboard interconnected by a switch, wherein the switch controls the routing of data between the processors, between the motherboard and daughterboard and between the daughterboard and further stacked daughterboards. The motherboard may have a plurality of daughterboard stacks (fig. 3, 22) mounted on it and may also contain a further switch (fig. 3, 24) to control the routing of data. The processors may be DSPs (digital signal processors) and the switches may be FPGAs.",CODIAN LTD,EVANS SIMON JAMES WINN,,https://lens.org/153-616-893-369-458,Patent Application,no,4,4,6,30,0,H04N7/15;;H04L67/14;;H04N7/152;;H04L49/206,H04N7/15;;H04L29/08,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

These additional processors, illustrated by daughterboards 22, are interconnected with a plurality of high bandwidth (ie / 3Gb/s) links 26. Each daughterboard typically comprises a field programmable gate array (FPGA) (32, figure 4) and four digital signal processors (DSP) (28, figure 4). Also provided are stream processors P (36, figure 4) which may carry out image scaling as well as compression, composition, motion compensation, encoding and other operations, which removes some of the processing load from other DSPs 28, and avoids using up available bandwidth by passing data between processors. The hardware architecture presented ensures that data processing is ideally performed by local DSPs thereby avoiding local bottlenecks, and where necessary, data may be moved in an efficient manner using the high bandwidth links. This architecture is particularly suited to video conferencing systems wherein the MCU is required to provide differently scaled images to different participants, dependent upon the capabilities of their local equipment. This overcomes the disadvantage of present MCUs which lack the processing capability or internal bandwidth availability to meet these processing-intensive demands. By processing the data internally using intelligent multicasting decision, intelligent scaling and compression decisions and acknowledging that the video data may be compressed without loss of visual quality, processing and bandwidth requirements may be met.",CODIAN LTD,EVANS SIMON JAMES WINN,,https://lens.org/017-645-764-319-528,Patent Application,no,2,0,4,30,0,G06F15/173;;G06F15/8007;;G06T1/20;;G06T3/40;;G06T1/20;;G06T3/4092;;H04N1/393;;H04N7/152;;H04N7/147;;H04N7/152;;H04N21/234363;;H04N21/2365;;H04N21/25833;;H04N21/4347,G06T1/20;;G06F15/173;;G06F15/80;;H04N1/393;;H04N7/15,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Closuring containers. METAL BOX CO., Ltd. Feb. 20, 1953 [April 28, 1952], No. 10708/52. Class 125 (2) In apparatus of the kind described in Specification 450,093 wherein screw closures are fed on to supports 6 beneath a plunger 7 which descends and rotates to carry the closure thr;ough the supports and apply it to a container, the closures pass by gravity down a shoot 5 having a resilient gate at its exit end and are pushed one at a time past the gate on to the supports 6 by a reciprocating member. As shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 4, a platform 1 is fitted with spaced brackets 2 the tops of which carry bars 3 the front ends of which are attached to the supports 6 and the rear ends of which carry each am inwardly facing U-shaped channel which co-operate to form the shcot 5. The spacing at the brackets 2 iis adjustable to suit different diameters of closure. The resilient gate is formed by spring plungers 13 carried on the shoot, the tension being adjustable by screws 14. A tongue 39 prevents a closure from rising when ejected 'from the shoot. If the gate jams, the closure forces down :a pivoted plate 15 against a spring 17 to allow ejection of the closure. Platform 1 carries spaced guides 23 for a slider 22 carrying a vertical arm 26 pivoted between two lugs 25. Two bars 21 extend forwardly from the arm 26 and carry at their front end a depending fork 18 entering between the two parts of the shoot. Bars 21 are normally urged to the position shown by a spring 32 acting an ,a projection 29 of the arm 26. A lever 35 engages between two rollers 34 carried on the top of arm 26 .and is reciprocated by a cam 38 through links 40, 41, 42. When the lever 35 moves to the right, Fig. 4, it first tilts the arm 26 clockwise against spring 32 to cause the fork 18 to enter the shoot to feed a closure past the resilient gate during advancement of the slider 22. When the lever moves to the left, spring 32 raises the fork to clear the next closure to be fed and then the slider is restored to its lefthand position. A stop 44 normally engages grooves in the guides 23 and in the slider 22 to prevent advancement of the latter but when a container approaches the capping station it actuates a lever 48 which withdraws the stop 44 against spring action to allow the feed of a closure. Altenatively, an approaching container may actuate directly the lever 35. In a modification, Fig. 5, an approaching container actuates am arm 48a to rock a shaft 59 which results in a plate 54 pivoting downwardly about its pivot 55. This causes descent of a rod 50 having a head 18a formed with an inclined susface 49 which enters between the first and second closure in the shoot 5a to feed the former past the resilient gate 11a.

These additional processors, illustrated by daughterboards 22, are interconnected with a plurality of high bandwidth (ie / 3Gb/s) links 26. Each daughterboard typically comprises a field programmable gate array (FPGA) (32, figure 4) and four digital signal processors (DSP) (28, figure 4). Also provided are stream processors P (36, figure 4) which may carry out compression, composition, motion compensation, encoding and other operations, which removes some of the processing load from other DSPs 28, and avoids using up available bandwidth by passing data between processors. The hardware architecture presented ensures that data processing is ideally performed by local DSPs thereby avoiding local bottlenecks, and where necessary, data may be moved in an efficient manner using the high bandwidth links. This architecture is particularly suited to video conferencing systems wherein the MCU is required to provide different content to each participant, dependent upon the capabilities of their local equipment. This overcomes the disadvantage of present MCUs which lack the processing capability or internal bandwidth availability to meet these processing-intensive demands.

ASSOCIATED ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES Ltd. March 13, 1962 [April 5, 1961], No. 12193/61. Heading H4D. In a pulse radar system of the type wherein the antenna nods in elevation and slowly turns in azimuth, and the echo signals are gated before display, such that the displayed targets are those occurring within a given height range, the height of the target is corrected for the earth's curvature by gating the echo signals by means of comparing the function Ax<SP>2</SP>+Bx, with upper and lower limits, where A is a constant, B is a function of the antenna elevation angle and x is the time from the start of the radar sweep, and opening and closing the gate when the function is equal to the lower and upper limits respectively. A first timing pulse 1 is generated at the beginning of each radar sweep and sets a bi-stable circuit into a first state, which in turn causes sweep generators 1 and 2 to start generating linear sweeps. A second timing pulse 2 is generated at the end of each radar sweep and returns the bi-stable circuit to its original state and so stops the generation of the sweep by generators 1 and 2. Generator 2 produces a sweep signal Bx, and is controlled in accordance with the antenna elevation angle. The output of generator 1 is integrated to give the signal Ax<SP>2</SP>, which is then combined with the signal Bx and the resultant signal is passed to lower and upper comparators, where the comparison with the lower and upper limits takes place. The comparators control a bi-stable control circuit, which in turn controls a gate passing the video signal from the radar receiver to the display. A plurality of PPI displays may be then provided, each showing targets in different height strata. The invention may provide radar displays showing all targets except those in a given height range.",ASS ELECT IND,EVANS RONALD HERBERT JAMES PUG,,https://lens.org/154-746-695-329-465,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G01S13/46,G01S13/46,H4D DSPX          SPX;;H4D D319          SPX;;H4D D319          2;;H4D D331          SPX;;H4D D331          2;;H4D D399          SPX;;H4D D399          2;;H4D D425          SPX;;H4D D425          2;;H4D D508          SPX;;H4D D508          2,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Typically, the finish toner is applied after a non-finish toner and/or a non-finish ink have been applied to the sheet of paper. Thus, the non-finish toner/ink provides the content of the sheet of paper while the finish toner provides a finish, such as a glossy, matte, or satin finish, etc. Such a system is well suited for creating and reproducing documents with finishes because large industrial printers are not required to produce the document finish.",AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES INC,EMMERT JAMES R;;EVANS CHARLES,,https://lens.org/082-201-481-267-916,Patent Application,no,5,0,5,5,0,B41F23/08;;B41L23/24;;B41M7/0027;;B41M7/0027;;B41M7/0027;;G03G8/00;;G06K15/14;;G03G15/0126;;G03G15/0126;;G03G8/00;;G03G8/00;;G03G9/00;;G03G9/00;;G03G15/2064;;G03G15/2064;;G03G15/6573;;G03G15/6573;;G03G15/6585;;G03G15/6585;;G03G2215/00805;;G03G2215/00805;;G03G2215/0081;;G03G2215/0081,G03G8/00;;B41F23/08;;B41L23/24;;B41M7/00;;G03G9/00;;G03G15/00;;G03G15/01;;G06K15/14,B6C CBQC          CBQ;;B6C CSAD          SAD;;B6C C715          CBQ;;B6C C72X          CBQ;;NOT CLASSIFIED    NONE,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

   A method with a traceable calibration for reducing the uncertainty in the precision measurement of aspheric surfaces and wavefronts. A transmission sphere is mounted in an interferometer and its emergent wavefront is calibrated by comparing it to an optical sphere that is moved and sampled in a predetermined manner to make it act like a substantially perfect sphere mounted on a slideway. Afterwards, the calibrated wavefront from the transmission sphere is used to measure a spherical artifact mounted on the slideway to calibrate its surface. A transmission asphere is then mounted in the interferometer, and its emergent wavefront is calibrated by comparing it to the calibrated spherical artifact mounted on the slideway. The calibrated aspheric wavefront from the interferometer is then used to measure an aspherical artifact mounted on the slideway to determine is surface shape. The calibration of the wavefront emerging from the transmission asphere is periodically updated to provide historical data that is used as the basis for quality improvement and assurance.

    A method with a traceable calibration for reducing the uncertainty in the precision measurement of aspheric surfaces and wavefronts. A transmission sphere is mounted in an interferometer and its emergent wavefront is calibrated by comparing it to an optical sphere that is moved and sampled in a predetermined manner to make it act like a substantially perfect sphere mounted on a slideway. Afterwards, the calibrated wavefront from the transmission sphere is used to measure a spherical artifact mounted on the slideway to calibrate its surface. A transmission asphere is then mounted in the interferometer, and its emergent wavefront is calibrated by comparing it to the calibrated spherical artifact mounted on the slideway. The calibrated aspheric wavefront from the interferometer is then used to measure an aspherical artifact mounted on the slideway to determine is surface shape. The calibration of the wavefront emerging from the transmission asphere is periodically updated to provide historical data that is used as the basis for quality improvement and assurance.

Typically, the effect toner is applied after a non-effect toner and/or a non-effect ink have been applied to the sheet of paper. Thus, the non-effect toner/ink provides the content of the sheet of paper while the clear toner provides an effect, such as watermarking, UV-reflection, etc. Such a system is well suited for creating and reproducing documents with effects because large industrial printers are not required to produce the document effects.",EMMERT JAMES R;;EVANS CHARLES,EMMERT JAMES R;;EVANS CHARLES,AVAGO TECHNOLOGIES IMAGING IP (SINGAPORE) PTE.

The magnetic field generated across the coil disposed in the host is used to power the client and to transfer data to the client. The data received by the client may, in turn, be used to configure the client. To receive data from the client, the coil disposed in the host is placed in a quiescent data recovery mode.

   A method for assembling fully functional sub-stacks of electrochemical cells, that includes securing a plurality of electrochemical cell components into a functioning sub-stack. The cell components may include, without limitation, bipolar plates, bipolar grids, monopolar plates, monopolar grids, membrane and electrode assemblies (MEA), gas diffusion elements, flow fields, cooling plates, heating plates and combinations thereof. Each of these components are assembled in a generally planar assembly, or a stack. The method further includes banding perimeter tabs of one component in the sub-stack to perimeter tabs of another component in the sub-stack. Banding the perimeter tabs does not compress the components together with such a force as to form fluid tight seals, but rather provides compression to hold each component in place and aligned during storage and normal handling of the sub-stack. The perimeter tabs extend from the perimeter of the component and in the same plane as the component.

Applying adhesive strip to a layer. BRITISH UNITED SHOE MACHINERY CO. Ltd. 5 Oct., 1967 [6 Oct., 1966], No. 44674/66. Heading B8F. One surface of a strip of thermoplastic adhesive film is rendered tacky by a hot gas stream and the strip is thereafter bonded under pressure to a marginal portion of a piece of sheet material, e.g. a shoe upper. The piece of sheet material may subsequently be secured to a further piece of sheet material by means of the adhesive film. The machine comprises a driven, rubber-covered feed roll 10, a downwardlybiased nylon presser roll 26 and a hot air delivery jet 69 for activating the lower surface of an adhesive film A immediately before the latter and a shoe upper (not shown), pass between the two rolls. The carriage 18-24 carrying the presser roll 26 is urged downwardly towards the feed roll 10 by a spring 44, the upper end of which bears on a block 34. The bias exerted by the spring is adjustable by varying the vertical position of the block 34. When the machine is not operating, the presser roll and its carriage can be raised well clear of the feed roll against the action of spring 44 by means of a piston and cylinder combination 60 acting through linkage 58-55, 48, 46, 52, 54. Air is supplied to the jet 69 from a pipe 66, via a heater (not shown), a valve 74 and pipe 64. The jet 69 is of narrow, elongated cross-section. The valve 74 may be operated by a piston and cylinder combination 88 acting through linkage 86-78 and 75 so that air is exhausted to atmosphere instead of flowing to jet 69. The adhesive film A is fed from a roll 92 to the nip between rolls 10 and 26 via guides 98 and 28. An edge gauge 102, Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 (not shown), the position of which relative to feed roll 10 is adjustable, is provided for assisting the manual guiding of a shoe upper (not shown). The film A may be based on ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer. Upon starting the machine, a valve arrangement (not shown) ensures that the presser roll 26 is not lowered into its operative position until the air issuing from jet 69 has attained its operative temperature, about 94‹ C. At this temperature, the lower surface of film A is activated while the upper surface remains non-tacky. The presser roll 26 may be stepped to accommodate a fold in the shoe upper. The working surface 6, over which the shoe upper is moved, is covered with PTFE cloth. The adhesive film may be carried on a backing layer.",BRITISH UNITED SHOE MACHINERY,CLARKE TERENCE JAMES LEONARD;;EVANS IVOR,,https://lens.org/012-276-540-395-852,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,A43D25/183,A43D25/18,B8F F5            -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In particular, the invention concerns using radio waves for identifying a depth and material of an object within a media. This system can perform target and media identification in real-time. This process is achieved by the system's processor where the media identification results can be visually displayed on an output unit. The generated carrier signal used in the radar system is an exponentially decaying superimposed direct and alternating signal. The frequency of the carrier signal can be in the microwave region. The system performs analog to digital (A/D) conversion using integrated circuitry whose sampling rate is in the same as the carrier signal transmission rate. In addition, Fourier and Hilbert transforms of the observed signal is generated for frequency domain analysis of the observed object to be identified and a profile inversion methodology for real time analysis.

Alternatively, image data can be associated with a color model and image processing operations can operate on the image data in terms of the color model. No color model is presupposed for a given image. When an image processing operation uses a color system, a color system can be selected in which the operation is performed and the source image will be converted. Different color systems can be associated with the same image data to process the image. Where it is not necessary to perform an image processing operation in a color system, the operation can access the image data independent of a color system. In an embodiment of the invention, a Tile object class is comprised of an array of Channel objects. A Channel object is associated with one or more storage bands of image data. A ColorModel object class identifies a color system and specifies a mapping between the raw image data and the color and alpha components of a color system. A BufferedImage object class is defined that associates a ColorModel with a Tile. BufferedImageOp and TileOp interfaces are defined in embodiments of the invention that are implemented by image processing or filtering object classes. A BufferedImageOp interface is used for filtering operations performed within a color system. Filtering operations that are performed outside a color system use the TileOp interface.",SUN MICROSYSTEMS INC,EVANS JERALD;;GRAHAM JAMES;;HUNG JEANNETTE,SUN MICROSYSTEMS INC (1997-06-30);;ORACLE AMERICA INC (2010-02-12),https://lens.org/078-485-424-000-599,Granted Patent,yes,51,18,2,2,0,G06T11/001;;G06T11/001,H04N1/60;;G06T1/00;;G06T11/00;;G09G5/02;;H04N1/46,345/600;;345/546;;345/550;;345/543,1,0,,,"Andrew Clayton and Fulton, Nancy, ""3D Studio Max Applied"", Advanstar, pp. 125-153&200-211, 1996.",EXPIRED

   A system unit has at least a first network identity and a second network identity for communicating with a network, and an indication of which of the network identities was effective on the most recent complete initialization of the system unit. On a subsequent initialization of the system unit, for example after moving the system unit, the effective network identity is changed. The indication is reset to the effective network identity if initialization completes. A system unit can thus be taken out of service and then restarted with a different identity. This enables the system unit reliably to check information from the network without fear of conflict with its previous network identity. The system unit can be a service processor that is operable to allocate network identities to further units (e.g. on a shelf on which the service processor resides). The service processor can thus check on initialization that network identities that it is to allocate are not know already on the network, for example if the service processor had already allocated those identities to system units at a location from which it had been moved, to avoid conflicts occurring.

The fluidized bed is supported on a plate having perforations fitted with insert members defining orifices of reduced diameter. Titanium tetrachloride together with ferric chloride and other contaminating chlorides are simultaneously formed and removed together as a single gaseous mixture whilst the less readily chlorinated constituents accumulate in the bed from which they are periodically or continuously removed. The ore feed is preferably of 80-180 micron size whilst that of the carbon or coke is approximately twice this size. The gases enter the furnace at 2-50 times the minimum fluidizing velocity and the reaction temperature is maintained within the range of 500-1000 DEG C. According to an example the bed was formed of 1 part powdered coke and 4 parts of rutile sand which contained 1.2% of zircon. The bed was initially fluidized by admitting air and heating with a gas flame to 900 DEG C., after which air was cut off and chlorine fed at 15 DEG C. The bed was supported upon a perforated plate, the pressure drop across which was 3 1/2 lbs./square inch, and slightly less than the pressure drop across the bed. Titanium tetrachloride was fed through the top of the reaction vessel in a solid stream which fell into and, by evaporation, cooled the bed and maintained the temperature at 870 DEG C. The zircon content of the bed built up to 40% after which air flow replaced chlorine and a portion of the bed was removed through a port in the side of the reactor. Fresh rutile and coke was then added and chlorination continued.",BRITISH TITAN PRODUCTS,EVANS ARTHUR WALLACE;;GROVES JAMES DENNIS,,https://lens.org/110-906-456-437-673,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,C22B34/1222,C22B34/12,C1A AD10          AP10;;C1A AD41          AP10;;C1A AP10          AP10,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The improved arrangement and method also have the further capability of resolving individual orders of distortion products. The arrangement utilizes a noise signal generator that produces a pseudorandom signal made of several spectral components providing high spectral density throughout a large bandwidth to simulate a broadband message load obtained by frequency multiplexing several independent signal sources. The noise signal is shifted in frequency before a quiet band is produced in the signal applied to the transmission apparatus to be tested. The orders of intermodulation distortion products appearing in the quiet band of the output signal of the transmission apparatus are individually measured to evaluate same. Automation of the test sequence is provided by a computer which acts as a general controller. The computer also processes the test data obtained by using a conventional signal averaging technique. - i",WESTERN ELECTRIC CO,EVANS JAMES G;;HAYNIE GERALD D,,https://lens.org/008-284-515-164-513,Granted Patent,no,0,0,9,9,0,G01R23/20;;H04B3/46;;G01R23/20;;H04B3/46,G01R23/16;;G01R23/20;;H04B3/46;;H04B17/00;;H04L27/00,324-30,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A flexible piezoelectric-based transducer, mounted on a circumference of a rotating object senses acoustical energy traversing portions of the object. In a preferred embodiment, the transducer is affixed, using a suitable adhesive, within the enclosed portion of a wheel/tire assembly. The transducer senses acoustical energy, e.g., ultrasonic transmissions, generated by the tire contacting the road surface at its contact patch and, without need of external power, translates it to an electrical current and communicates it for further processing. Because the acoustical impedance of the tire casing changes with temperature, hot spots within the tire, as well as other characteristics of the tire's operation, can be detected. Further, any Doppler shift which occurs due to the rotating medium may be compensated for since the rate of tire rotation may be made known via a speed sensor. A position sensor may also be employed to indicate the position of the hot spot.

Noise is intentionally added to the voice signal to guarantee a minimum power level, while not disrupting normal demodulation. A digital signal, having a known maximum power level upon demodulation, is used to represent the ""on hook"" condition. Upon demodulation, the minimum power level of the noise-colored voice signal is greater than the maximum power level of the ""on-hook"" signal, and the two signals can be distinguished by a power level threshold detector. This apparatus and technique is particularly well-suited to under-sampled, such as CVSD (continuously variable slope delta), data links, which are usually noisy and distorted.

Alternatively, the planes of weakness may be so produced in the moulding stage that the whole of the leading edge L, Fig. 5, comes away with the outer skin when it is separated from the rest of the moulding. The parting agent may be a sheet of regenerated cellulose or a coating of methyl cellulose. The assembly placed in a mould 12 may comprise a layer 11 of uncured asbestos-reinforced synthetic resinous material, a thin layer 13 of glass fibre cloth, a layer 14 of regenerated cellulose, and a further layer 15 of glass fibre cloth, and sufficient further layers 16 of resin-treated asbestos to make up the required thickness.

AND SUBSTRATES COATED THEREWITH Epoxy resin is reacted with a terminating agent to eliminate at least part of the epoxide groups of the resin and form modified resin. The epoxy resin or such modified resin is also reacted with addition polymerizable monomer at elevated temperature in the presence of at least 3% of benzoyl peroxide based on the weight of such monomer. Generally the latter reaction is done at about 110.degree.C to about 120.degree.C. These two reactions can be performed in any desired sequence, or simultaneously. The final reaction mixture produced contains: (a) graft polymer; (b) ungrafted, modified resin; and (c) ungrafted addition polymer, formed associatively with the graft polymer. While other kinds of grafting can and often do occur between addition polymer and the epoxy resin or modified resin, the term ""graft polymer"" herein connotes specifically carbon-to-carbon grafting of addition polymer onto the modified resin. The proportion of the graft copolymer in the final reaction mixture is effective for imparting outstanding dispersion stability to aqueous dispersions of the reaction mixture. The modification eliminates vagaries of epoxy reactions. Accordingly, the invention is useful for making coating compositions. The compositions thus can have good weather resistance and are particularly useful for making sanitary coatings for cans for foods and beverages, especially for beer. The coatings compositions can be aqueous dispersions for spray application or concentrates or powders that can be made up readily into aqueous sprayable coating compositions.

A suitable apparatus comprises a furnace at the bottom of which is introduced initially air or oxygen and subsequently chlorine gas. The chlorine reacts with a finely ground heated mixture of titanium ore and powdered carbon which is introduced at the top of the furnace. A continuous process is maintained by volatilizing all ore-impurities in addition to the titanium as their respective chlorides so that the composition of the reaction mixture remains constant. The volatile chlorides and a small proportion of very fine solid particles are passed to the base of a column which is fitted at the top with a reflux condenser and at the bottom with a reboiler containing titanium tetrachloride. A small proportion of the condensed titanium tetrachloride is taken off continuously from the condenser and purified. The remainder is returned down the column where it condenses uprising gases and carries condensed chloride impurities &c. down to the reboiler.

The weight of each material applied to the tool is compared to a predetermined target weight after the individual steps of applying the material. If the amount of either material applied to the tool falls outside selected limits of the weight target, the tool assembly may be rejected at that stage of the process. Only tools which successfully pass the comparison step are further processed and introduced to the fusion for step braze bonding the alloy and abrasive particles to the tool. This permits the tool components from rejected tools to be recovered and recycled if desired. Also disclosed is a method of using this weight monitoring process to fabricate tools having a known range of amounts of alloy and abrasive particles applied and testing the same to determine the most desirable weight target to be used as related to improved tool performance.
