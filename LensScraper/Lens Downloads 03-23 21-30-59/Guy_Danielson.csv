A series of radio base stations make up a infrastructure network. The infrastructure network and at least one portable computer device make up the first local area network. The communication on the first local area network is accomplished by spread spectrum frequency hopping communication A second local area network allows for radio communication between a portable computer device and peripheral devices with built-in transceivers utilized by the portable computer device. The communication in each local area network is controlled by a reservation access communication protocol. The communication protocol facilitates frequency hopping synchronization and supports adaptive data rate selection based upon the quality of communication on the communication channel. The communication protocol prevents interference between communication on the first local area network and communication on the second local area network. In a premises LAN, a series of radio base stations and a backbone LAN make up an infrastructure network. The infrastructure network and at least one mobile computing device make up a higher-power LAN, utilizing a frequency hopping protocol. A lower-power LAN allows for radio communication between a mobile computing device and peripheral devices, utilizing a single-frequency spread spectrum protocol. A vehicular LAN provides for short-range communication between a vehicle terminal and a portable terminal. When out of direct RF range of the premises LAN, the vehicle terminal maintains indirect communication when necessary with the premises LAN via one of several alternate RF channels. A microprocessor, located inside radio units which participate in multiple LAN's, selects the appropriate protocol, frequency band and power level for communicating through the network.",BROADCOM CORP,MAHANY RONALD L;;WEST GUY J;;BUNTE ALAN G;;DANIELSON ARVIN D;;MORRIS MICHAEL D;;MEIER ROBERT C,AVAGO TECHNOLOGIES GENERAL IP (SINGAPORE) PTE.

   Portable measuring devices which communicate by low power transceivers through a communication controller with a printer device collect weight and size data on articles to be shipped. The collected weight and size data are combined with origin and destination data, and labels are printed bearing pertinent shipping and routing information in machine readable format. The labels are attached to the articles to be shipped and accompany the articles to their respective destinations. At transfer points the labels are read by scanner devices which also communicate by low power transceiver links with the communication controller. The wireless linking of the scanner devices promotes human safety by the absence of cords which could cause entanglement of an operator in mechanized conveying equipment. The communication controllers at each stage of the shipping process have the capability of transferring received and updated status information on the shipped articles to a central data station.

    A mobile customer service station operating within a wireless multi-hop communication network includes a console on a wheeled chassis. The console carries and houses a number of components which are used in merchandising operations to conclude customer purchase transactions. The items supported externally on the console are a printer for printing purchase receipts, customer credit charge agreements and records of transactions, and a magnetic card reader for reading information from a magnetic stripe of a customer's credit card. In one embodiment, the operation of the printer, credit card reader and the cash drawer is controlled by a multi-function control unit located within an enclosure of the console. The control unit is electrically powered by a self-contained power source which is preferably a deep cycle rechargeable battery. The console also houses a transceiver unit which under the control of the control unit is capable of interactive communication with a premises network. In another embodiment, the mobile service station comprises an access device which participates with a variety of peripherals at the station in a lower power communication LAN, while providing higher power communication to other network devices via a premises network with routing via a wireless spanning tree configuration.

   A mobile customer service station operating within a wireless multi-hop communication network includes a console on a wheeled chassis. The console carries and houses a number of components which are used in merchandising operations to conclude customer purchase transactions. The items supported externally on the console are a printer for printing purchase receipts, customer credit charge agreements and records of transactions, and a magnetic card reader for reading information from a magnetic stripe of a customer's credit card. In one embodiment, the operation of the printer, credit card reader and the cash drawer is controlled by a multi-function control unit located within an enclosure of the console. The control unit is electrically powered by a self-contained power source which is preferably a deep cycle rechargeable battery. The console also houses a transceiver unit which under the control of the control unit is capable of interactive communication with a premises network. In another embodiment, the mobile service station comprises an access device which participates with a variety of peripherals at the station in a lower power communication LAN, while providing higher power communication to other network devices via a premises network with routing via a wireless spanning tree configuration.

A network controller and an adapter which has a simulcast and sequential mode provide selective interface between host computers and base transceivers. A scheme for routing data through the communication system is also disclosed wherein the intermediate base stations are organized into an optimal spanning-tree network to control the routing of data to and from the RF terminals and the host computer efficiently and dynamically. Additionally, redundant network and communication protocol is disclosed wherein the network utilizes a polling communication protocol which, under heavy loaded conditions, requires that a roaming terminal wishing to initiate communication must first determine that the channel is truly clear by listing for an entire interpoll gap time. In a further embodiment, a criterion used by the roaming terminals for attaching to a given base station reduces conflicts in the overlapping RF regions of adjacent base stations.",BROADCOM CORP,GOLLNICK CHARLES D;;LUSE RONALD E;;PAVEK JOHN G;;SOJKA MARVIN L;;CNOSSEN JAMES D;;DANIELSON ARVIN D;;MAHANY RONALD L;;DETWEILER MARY L;;SPIESS GARY N;;WEST GUY J;;YOUNG AMOS D;;MEIER ROBERT C;;CARGIN JR KEITH K;;ARENSDORF RICHARD C;;GEERS ROBERT G,AVAGO TECHNOLOGIES GENERAL IP (SINGAPORE) PTE.

Instead of requiring the transceiver within each terminal to always be active, the receiver is activated in synchrony with the transmissions of pending message indications from at least one of the base stations. Otherwise, the terminal may deactivate the transceiver, i.e., place it in a sleep state. The terminal may also sleep through pluralities of transmissions of pending message indications, and, thereafter, awake in synchrony to receive subsequent pending message indications. To minimize noise, the terminal may operate using a lower frequency system clock when not collecting data. When collecting data, especially where processing time proves more critical, the system clock frequency is increased.",NORAND CORP,GOLLNICK CHARLES D;;LUSE RONALD E;;PAVEK JOHN G;;SOJKA MARVIN L;;CNOSSEN JAMES D;;DANIELSON ARVIN D;;MAHANY RONALD L;;DETWEILER MARY L;;SPIESS GARY N;;WEST GUY J;;YOUNG AMOS D;;MEIER ROBERT C;;CARGIN JR KEITH K;;ARENSDORF RICHARD C;;GEERS ROBERT G,AVAGO TECHNOLOGIES GENERAL IP (SINGAPORE) PTE.
