After casting and solidification of a first material in the first mould cavity (236, 237), the second mould part (245) is pulled back, while the formed first material remains in the first mould part (230). A third mould part (250) is then fitted, in contact, on the first mould part (230) in order to inject a material which can flow. Constructed in the third mould part (250) is a second mould cavity (252) into which a portion (225) of the first material projects. The material which can flow and is injected into the second mould cavity (252) flows around this portion (225), which extends into the second mould cavity (252), of the first material, whereupon it solidifies, blocking specific sections of the first material. The composite body can thus be produced easily using mass-production methods. <IMAGE>",GLOBE UNION INC,GROFF JEROME JOHN;;HALSALL VINCENT MICHAEL;;BUCKETHAL PAUL JOHN;;HENNEN ROY ERVING,,https://lens.org/040-027-857-579-703,Granted Patent,no,0,0,9,11,0,B22D19/00;;B29C45/16;;B29C45/1635;;B29C2045/1681;;B29C2045/1696;;H01M4/72;;Y02E60/10,B22D19/00;;B29C45/16;;H01M4/72,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The transaction managers store transaction result information to allow recovery of a transaction in case of system failure. The method includes acts for minimizing storage overhead by minimizing the number of transaction managers used to coordinate transactions. The method includes identifying a set of transaction managers. A first transaction manager is selected from among the set of transaction managers. A second transaction manager is identified from among the set of transaction managers that is always available when the first transaction manager is available.

The STM system acquires each traditional lock the first time that a corresponding traditional lock acquire is encountered inside a transaction and defers all traditional lock releases until a top level transaction in a transaction nest commits or aborts. The STM system maintains state information associated with traditional lock operations in transactions and uses the state information to eliminate deferred traditional lock operations that are redundant.

A cabinet traveling down an assembly line is arranged on the support arm as the cabinet proceeds through various assembly stations. The support arm can articulate relative to the base assembly from a home, normally horizontal position to a position angled with respect to the direction of travel in order to enhance assembly procedures. An adjustable arm assembly including a cam roller and roller guide structure are provided to establish the home position and to counterbalance the weight of the cabinet. A tilt stop mechanism is employ to enable adjustments in the degree of pivoting of the support arm and provisions are made to automatically reposition the cabinet in the home position following various assembly stages.
