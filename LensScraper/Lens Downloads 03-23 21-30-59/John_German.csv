[Also in Group XVII] A spring unit for separating the inner and outer casings of a packaging container comprises a series of parallel torsion bars 1a, Fig. 9, carrying parallel lever arms 7a which are interposed between the casings to deflect angularly and apply twisting couples to the torsion bars 1a. In one example the torsion bars 1a are clamped to one casing by plates 3. Fig. 2, and are rotatable in a locating plate 5 which may be initially disposed away from the casing due to a small set made in the torsion bars to allow for tolerance on assembly. The lever arms 7a are alternately crossed-over and hooked ends 8b of the arms 7a are slidable on the other casing which may carry wear plates (not shown). Wires 20 passed through the hooked ends 8b retain the arms 7a in the required position with a pre-loading. In a modification the ends 8, Fig. 8, of the lever arms 7 are slidable on a cam plate 10 which has longitudinal grooves 12 to guide the sliding ends and is locked to the lever arms by a a slotted plate 16. A raised cam face 15 on the plate 10 assists initial movement of the arms 7. Various means are described for pre-loading the arms 7 such as by forming interengaging cranked portions or attaching cross-pieces intermediately of the lengths where the arms are crossed over.",SECR AVIATION;;JOHN KENNETH BACHE,BACHE JOHN KENNETH;;GERMAN GEORGE,,https://lens.org/070-033-152-261-921,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B65D81/07,B65D81/07,B8P PE2E          PE2E;;F2S SCA           SCA;;F2S SCB           SCB605/7/9;;F2S S505          SCA;;F2S S511          SCA;;F2S S515          SCA;;F2S S516          SCA;;F2S S605          SCB605/7/9,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The separate outputs of two LCD monitors are optically superimposed, one for the left eye and one for the right eye of a user, in order to produce a brighter stereoscopic three-dimensional display. By selecting angles of linear polarization for the rear and the side LCD monitors or other display devices, embodiments of the invention can achieve as much as 60/60 efficiency for the display pair, according to the Fresnel laws of reflection regarding polarization. This intensity increase can provide a viewer a significantly brighter picture and allow the installation environment of the stereoscopic display to maintain higher ambient lighting conditions.

The separate outputs of two LCD monitors are optically superimposed, one for the left eye and one for the right eye of a user, in order to produce a brighter stereoscopic three-dimensional polarization for the rear and the side display. By selecting angles of linear LCD monitors or other display devices, embodiments of the invention can achieve as much as 60/60 efficiency for the display pair, according to the Fresnel laws of reflection regarding polarization. This intensity increase can provide a viewer a significantly brighter picture and allow the installation environment of the stereoscopic display to maintain higher ambient lighting conditions. Embodiments of the invention also can achieve both, a more efficient polarizer orientation, and the required mirror-image reversal in one simple step.",BOEING CO,MERRITT JOHN O;;THAL GERMAN VON,,https://lens.org/197-593-463-625-834,Patent Application,no,4,0,6,6,0,H04N13/337;;H04N13/346;;G02B30/25;;H04N13/30;;G02B30/00;;G02B30/25;;H04N13/337;;H04N13/346;;G02B30/25,H04N13/04;;G02B27/22;;G02B30/25,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The separate outputs of two LCD monitors are optically superimposed, one for the left eye and one for the right eye of a user, in order to produce a brighter stereoscopic three-dimensional display. By selecting angles of linear polarization for the rear and the side LCD monitors or other display devices, embodiments of the invention can achieve as much as 60/60 efficiency for the display pair, according to the Fresnel laws of reflection regarding polarization. This intensity increase can provide a viewer a significantly brighter picture and allow the installation environment of the stereoscopic display to maintain higher ambient lighting conditions. Embodiments of the invention also can achieve both, a more efficient polarizer orientation, and the required mirror-image reversal in one simple step.",BOEING CO;;MERRITT JOHN O;;VON THAL GERMAN,MERRITT JOHN O;;VON THAL GERMAN,,https://lens.org/016-535-428-699-935,Patent Application,yes,0,2,6,6,0,H04N13/337;;H04N13/346;;G02B30/25;;H04N13/30;;G02B30/00;;G02B30/25;;H04N13/337;;H04N13/346;;G02B30/25,G02B30/25,,0,0,,,,PENDING

   Heat dissipation during the operation of integrated circuit chips is an old problem that continues to get worse. The present invention significantly ameliorates this by placing an embedded heat pipe directly beneath the chip. Using powder injection molding, the lower portion of the package is formed first as an initial green part which includes one or more cavities. The latter are then lined with a feedstock that is designed to produce a porous material after sintering, at which time a working fluid is introduced into the porous cavities and sealed, thereby forming one or more heat pipes located directly below the chip. The latter is then sealed inside an enclosure. During operation, heat generated by the chip is efficiently transferred to points outside the enclosure. A process for manufacturing the structure is also described.

The modifications include adding to ethyl formate a viscosity modifying thickening agent, and one or more substances which function as a co-solvent and dilution agent (the co-solvent and dilution may or may not be the same). The thickening agent increases the viscosity thereby slowing its flow or rate of transport through the soil. The co-solvent functions as the primary solvent for the viscosity modifying thickening agent. The dilution agent does two things. First, it is used to reduce the partial vapor pressure of the ethyl formate in the formulation, thereby slowing its evaporation rate. Second, it also slows the rate and amount of decomposition of the ethyl formate. The SFMEF compositions and methods do not have harmful ozone-depleting side effects and break down into two naturally-occurring, environmentally-friendly components.

    A laser system for use in medical, industrial, commercial or research applications in which the location and energy and power density of a nonvisible (e.g., infrared or ultraviolet) laser beam is defined by a plurality of visible beams. Collimating optics are used to direct both the nonvisible and visible beams on the target, such that when the visible beam is in focus on the target, the nonvisible beam has the optimum energy and power density. One implementation of the invention is a self-contained hand-held surgical laser that provides surgeons with the optimal laser beam parameters for laser tissue soldering.

The sign of the sampled signal at two sample points is compared to determine in which quadrant a predetermined one of these sample points is located. The phase adjustment to the sampling signal is dependent upon the quadrant in which this sample point is located and the magnitude of this sample point. A large phase difference produces a large phase adjustment so that this sample point is quickly locked onto the zero-crossing points of the incoming reference signal. A small phase difference produces a small phase adjustment and prevents jitter. The lock onto the zero-crossing point of the incoming reference signal minimizes the data error rate of the modem.,HAYES MICROCOMPUTER PROD,TJAHJADI TARUNA;;CORREA GERMAN E;;EASLEY MATTHEW F;;MARTIN JOHN N,TELOGY NETWORKS INC (1999-03-03),https://lens.org/175-308-487-207-318,Granted Patent,yes,7,22,1,22,0,H04L5/18;;H04L25/03044;;H04M11/06;;H04M11/06;;H04L25/03044;;H04L5/18,H04L5/18;;H04L25/03;;H04M11/06,375/106;;328/155;;307/511,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The apparatus includes a fuser having an array of addressable heating elements in radiative communication with a substrate through a fuser roll or fuser belt. The array of addressable heating elements is operated to selectively heat portions of the substrate to achieve a desired effect on the substrate, such as changing its surface finish, or fusing unfused toner to the substrate. In the case of toner fusing, the array is operated such that substantially only an area covered by the unfused toner is heated. This eliminates the need for blanket fusing, and generally provides for greater flexibility in xerographically processing substrates. Apparatus and methods for performing two-sided selective fusing and/or heating are also disclosed.",PALO ALTO RES CT INC;;XEROX CORP,LOFTHUS ROBERT M;;GERMAN KRISTINE A;;BOTT DONALD M;;ANDREWS JOHN R;;BIEGELSEN DAVID K;;VOLKEL ARMIN R,PALO ALTO RESEARCH CENTER INCORPORATED (2009-01-12);;XEROX CORPORATION (2009-01-12),https://lens.org/141-724-552-203-567,Granted Patent,yes,20,6,4,4,0,G03G15/2007;;G03G15/2007,G03G15/20,399/69,0,0,,,,INACTIVE
