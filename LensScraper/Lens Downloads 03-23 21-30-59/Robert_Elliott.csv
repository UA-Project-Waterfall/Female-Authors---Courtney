Elliott, R. June 29. Window opening and closing apparatus.-Relates to handles, rods, chains, hooks, knobs, rings, and the like for raising and lowering sliding sashes. The handles may be fixed to brackets secured to the stiles of the upper sash, or they may be connected to the brackets by single or double hinges, pivots, ball-and-socket joints, knuckle-joints, or the like, so as to fold up against the sash stiles out of the way of the lower sash. In the arrangement shown in Fig. 8<1>, a lifting-rod is secured to the sash stile A by brackets b, and an angular handle c is pivoted to a bracket of the sash, and is supported out of action by a link d, or hook. Fig. 7 shows a handle c, which is connected to a weight g by a cord a passing over a pulley k, and is formed with a projection j, which comes in contact with a fixed stop i when the handle is pulled down. When the handle is released, the weight g pulls it up close to the sash stile. In the form shown in Fig. 8<2>, a number of parallel links are jointed together so as to fold against the sash, as indicated by the dotted lines. Fig. 11<5> shows a handle a formed with a ball k adapted to turn in a spherical socket b<1> of a bracket b, which is made with stops i, j to hold the handle at right-angles to the sash. Fig. 10 shows a handle a carried by arms a<1>, a<2> on a pin passing through a boss b<1> of a bracket b fixed to the sash. A spring m retains the handle in a projecting or folded position. A rubber washer or spring may be interposed between the arm a<1> and boss b<1>, and the arm a<2> and boss b<1> may be formed with interlocking radial teeth. Other arrangements are described, in which hinged and pivoted handles and rods are maintained in position by interlocking pins and slots, tongues and grooves, hooks, links, turn-buckles, lugs, and springs, and the hinges may be made to rise and fall, and may be formed with flat bearing-surfaces, or with lugs or knucklejoints. In the arrangement shown in Fig. 11<10>, the handle c is formed with teeth which interlock with teeth on the rod a. A spring m causes the teeth to engage when the handle is turned. Handles made of rings, rubber blocks, or the like, threaded on pins or rods, may be secured to the sash by screws.",ELLIOTT ROBERT,ELLIOTT ROBERT,,https://lens.org/021-098-952-412-230,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

A novel threshold and delay noise discrimination network is interconnected between this input circuit of the system and the pair of bistable flip-flops and it discriminates between body capacitance signals and line noise in order to minimize false operation of the system due to line noise. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the triggerable switches are a pair of TRIACS which respond to a predetermined sequence of conductive states of the pair of flip-flops, respectively, to provide successively higher power levels to multiple loads in response to successive body capacitance signals received at the touch signal input circuit.",BELLIS ROBERT ELLIOTT,BELLIS ROBERT ELLIOTT,,https://lens.org/161-234-683-348-153,Granted Patent,no,9,26,8,8,0,H03K17/725;;H03K17/962;;Y10S323/904;;H03K17/725;;H03K17/962;;Y10S323/904,H03K17/725;;H03K17/96,315/294,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The coded signals carry transmitter and base unit identifiers, low battery and attachment status information. The base unit periodically scans using an omnidirectional antenna to determine distance and azimuth for multiple active transmitters, alerting an operator to any status alerts, such as ‘out of range’ status determined by signal strength. The operator can switch to a higher gain, directional antenna to search for an errant target transmitter, or simply to check on the whereabouts of any given target item. Because the movable target items need only transmit, the transmitters can be physically diminutive and unobtrusive to the target wearer, making the system practical for tracking people (e.g. geriatric or juvenile, for assistance or to deter leaving group members behind), animals (e.g. pets, livestock) and even inventory (e.g. especially expensive items that shouldn't move from a given spot in a retail setting).",ELLIOTT ROBERT O,ELLIOTT ROBERT O,,https://lens.org/194-696-265-627-970,Patent Application,yes,18,28,2,2,0,G08B13/1427;;G08B13/2434;;G08B13/2462;;G08B21/0202;;G08B13/2434;;G08B21/0202;;G08B13/1427;;G08B13/2462,G08B5/22;;G08B1/08;;G08B13/14;;G08B21/00;;G08B23/00,340/539.23;;340/539.21;;340/687;;340/825.49;;340/568.1;;340/573.1,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The operator can switch to a higher gain, directional antenna to search for an errant target transmitter, or simply to check on the whereabouts of any given target item. Because the movable target items need only transmit, the transmitters can be physically diminutive and unobtrusive to the target wearer, making the system practical for tracking people (e.g. geriatric or juvenile, for assistance or to deter leaving group members behind), animals (e.g. pets, livestock) and even inventory (e.g. especially expensive items that shouldn't move from a given spot in a retail setting).",ELLIOTT ROBERT ODELL,ELLIOTT ROBERT ODELL,,https://lens.org/036-736-424-610-135,Granted Patent,yes,18,14,2,2,0,G08B13/1427;;G08B13/2434;;G08B13/2462;;G08B21/0202;;G08B13/2434;;G08B21/0202;;G08B13/1427;;G08B13/2462,G08B1/08,340/539.23;;340/539.1;;340/539.13;;340/539.21;;340/573.1;;340/686.1;;340/7.1;;340/825.36,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

Elemental sulphur from sulphide ores. ATKINS, HATCH & ASSOCIATES Ltd. 29 March, 1967 [30 March, 1966], No. 14068/66. Heading C1A. Elemental sulphur is recovered from pyritic bearing ores by stagewise fluidized bed treatment in which the ore is partially decomposed in a first fluidized bed treatment zone to volatilize the labile sulphur atom in the ore and then the partially decomposed ore is fluidized bed roasted in a subsequent zone to produce hot SO 2 -containing gases and an iron oxide calcine characterized by feeding to the first zone hydrocarbon reducing agent preferably directly into the body of the ore undergoing treatment, and the hot SO 2 -containing gases generated in the subsequent roasting zone whereby owing to the combustion of the hydrocarbon in the first zone, reducing agents are produced effective to reduce the SO 2 to elemental sulphur. The reducing agent may be a finely divided carbonaceous material, a liquid hydrocarbon fuel or natural gas. The temperature of the solids in the volatilizing zone is maintained in the range between 600‹ and 900‹ C., and in the roasting zone between 800‹ and 1000‹ C. The two-stage process represented in Fig. 1 contains a volatilizing zone ""V"" in the upper shell 10 and a roasting zone ""R"" in the lower shell 12. Each shell has a fluidized bed of the material being treated, namely 30 and 32 in shells 10 and 12, respectively, and is supported on a gaspermeable plate 22, provided with a plurality of orifices 24. The solids and fluidizing gases move generally countercurrently, the former moving downwardly through ""V"" and ""R"" via conduit 64, and the latter moving upwardly through ""R"" and ""V"" via inlet 38. Ore is introduced into bed 30 through conduit 62, and reducing agent is introduced through conduit 68. The hot SO 2 -containing gases from ""R"" are introduced into ""V"" at a velocity sufficient to fluidize bed 30, and contribute a portion of the heat necessary to maintain the temperature of the solids so that the labile sulphur in the ore is volatilized. Entrained fines in the SO 2 gas from ""R"" are removed in cyclone 34, and entrained fines in the exhaust gas from ""V"" are removed in cyclone 54. Bed 32, comprising the partially desulphurized ore, is fluidized by air and preheated air introduced respectively through valved conduits 46 and 72. Three and four stage fluidized bed reactors are also described.",ATKINS HATCH & ASSOCIATES LTD,ELLIOTT ROBERT A,,https://lens.org/178-983-587-274-495,Granted Patent,no,0,2,4,4,0,C01B17/06;;Y02P20/129,C01B17/06,C1A AK9BY         -;;C1A AK9B3C        -;;C1A AK9B4C        -;;C1A AK9B4F        -;;C1A AK9B4Y        -;;C1A AK9B5A        -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Sept. 13. Window blinds.-Relates to means, particularly applicable to spring-actuated roller blinds of the type known as "" Hartshorn "" blinds, for preventing the blind from being drawn down too far, and consequently being detached from the roller or torn. The end of the roller is provided with a channelled plate 3, furnished with a bridge 4 carrying the pin or stud 5. A stop 7, having an outwardly-projecting stud 9, slides in the channel or way in the plate 3, the motion being limited by a projection 8 thereon engaging a shoulder 6 on the plate 3. When the blind 2 is wound up, the arm 13 of the stop 7 lies against the surface of the roller beneath several convolutions of the blind. On lowering the blind and releasing the arm 13, the stop 7 falls into the position shown in Fig. 3, where the stud 9 engages a projection 10 on the bracket 11 and prevents further unwinding of the blind. The device is so arranged that, when the stop 7 comes into action, the winding-spring returns the roller half a revolution before the operation of the catch, at the opposite end of the roller, which secures the blind, in order to allow the blind to be drawn slightly to release the catch when the blind is to be wound up. The lower face of the stud 9 and the upper face of the projection 10 are bevelled, to prevent the arrest of the blind in its ascent in the event of the stop 7 not being forced in during the first revolution of the roller.",WAGELEY ROBERT ELLIOTT,WAGELEY ROBERT ELLIOTT,,https://lens.org/187-451-820-142-86X,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, some or all schedulers of a communication node are associated with one or more storage devices that maintain values used by corresponding higher level schedulers to make scheduling decisions. Because of the nature of the scheduling decision flow and the potential to update registers in real-time, the scheduling arrangement can respond almost immediately to changes occurring at the input queues, which allows scheduling to be responsive to differing priorities of incoming cells. The nature of the scheduling decision flow also allows pipelined scheduling, in which scheduling of one or more additional cells can begin before scheduling of a first cell is completed.

In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, some or all schedulers of a communication node are associated with one or more storage devices that maintain values used by corresponding higher level schedulers to make scheduling decisions. Because of the nature of the scheduling decision flow and the potential to update registers in real-time, the scheduling arrangement can respond almost immediately to changes occurring at the input queues, which allows scheduling to be responsive to differing priorities of incoming cells. The nature of the scheduling decision flow also allows pipelined scheduling, in which scheduling of one or more additional cells can begin before scheduling of a first cell is completed.",CIT ALCATEL,ROBOTHAM ROBERT ELLIOTT;;LU JORDAN,ALCATEL LUCENT (2007-04-04),https://lens.org/128-979-800-312-767,Patent Application,yes,0,1,6,6,0,H04L47/60;;H04L47/60;;H04L45/04;;H04L45/04;;H04L47/50;;H04L47/50;;H04L47/527;;H04L47/527;;H04L47/621;;H04L47/621;;H04L47/6215;;H04L47/6215,H04L12/56,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The GART table enables the AGP graphics controller to work in contiguous virtual memory address space, but actually use non-contiguous blocks or pages of physical system memory to store textures, command lists and the like. The GART table is made up of a plurality of entries, each entry comprising an address pointer to a base address of a page of graphics data in memory, and feature flags that may be used to customize the associated page. The core logic chipset may cache a subset of the most recently used GART table entries to increase AGP performance when performing the address translation. A GART cache entry control register is used by an application programming interface, such as a GART miniport driver, to indicate to the core logic chipset that an individual GART table entry in the chipset cache should be invalidated and/or updated.

   A pneumatic actuator adapted for placement between a pair of spaced members for controlling relative movement between said members is formed of two different hardness plastic materials and includes a rigid base and a flexible top member forming an internal air chamber therebetween. The top member is movable between collapsed and expanded positions by pressurized air introduced into the internal chamber for relative movement of the spaced members. The base has a sidewall terminating in a peripheral edge on which the top member is sealingly secured by a hot welded joint. A central portion of the top member has a raised thickened portion which engages one of the spaced members. A stop is located within the internal chamber to maintain the central portion of the top member above the peripheral edge of the base to prevent contact of the spaced member with the sealed joint when the top member is in the collapsed position. An air passage is formed in the base to enable the pressurized air to enter the internal chamber.

The fresh citrus fruit are initially chilled to a temperature well below room temperature, preferably less than about 10 degrees C. The chilled fruit are then scored so as to penetrate the albedo layer, but not the underlying juice sections, and the scored fruit are then immersed in an aqueous solution of a pectinase enzyme at an initial temperature of about 35 degrees C. The enzyme solution is then infused into the fruit, and after holding the infusion-treated fruit in the solution for a prescribed time period, without application of additional heat, the peel can be readily removed from the whole fruit. Chilling the fruit before infusing the pectinase enzyme allows the core of the fruit to reach a temperature low enough to insure that the pectinase enzyme retains its full effectiveness only in the region of the peel and not at the membrane connecting together the segments of the fruit.

The method includes pooling the available storage to create virtual drives, which represent the available storage and may be a combination of logical unit number (LUN) pages. The volumes within the available data storage are divided into pages, and volumes of LUN pages are created based on available pages. The virtual drives are presented to the server, and a logical command is received from the server requesting access to the storage represented by the virtual drives. The command is transmitted to controllers for the available storage and a link is established between the server and controllers with data being exchanged directly between the server and controllers.

An inlet check valve permits oil in the formation to flow into the housing when the bladder is collapsed. When the bladder is expanded or displaced by the gas, the oil in the housing is displaced through an outlet check valve into a flow line which extends to the well surface. A submerged control valve channels gas into the bladder to control the bladder expansion. The control valve also functions to permit the gas in the bladder to flow into a vent tube to control bladder deflation. In a modified form of the invention, oil flowing into the housing expands the bladder and gas supplied to the housing collapses the bladder.

The instructions and operational signals can be recorded together on a two-track record, such as magnetic tape, so that the instructions are coordinated with the system actuating signals. The system is manually started and introductory material is presented from the record. After instructions are given, a signal starts a clock to measure the elapsed time for performance of instructions. The clock is terminated by a system actuating signal following execution of the last instruction. In the preferred system, actuation of the predetermined key will initiate the record drive which will be stopped after each unit of instruction is given by an appropriate signal on the other track, different from the ones actuating the clock.

Channel 4 cascading is also handled via tracking registers and special cycles to maintain disable and masking functionality of channel 4 as it effects channels 0-3.,COMPAQ COMPUTER CORP,RILEY DWIGHT D;;ELLIOTT ROBERT C,COMPAQ COMPUTER CORPORATION (1996-04-26);;HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT LP (2015-10-27);;HEWLETT-PACKARD DEVELOPMENT COMPANY L.P (2002-10-01),https://lens.org/179-177-258-390-460,Granted Patent,yes,5,46,10,10,0,G06F13/126;;G06F13/28;;G06F13/28;;G06F13/126,G06F13/12;;G06F13/28,395/842,3,0,,,"Intel 8237A High Performance Programmable DMA Controller (8237A, 8237A 4, 8237A 5); Oct. 1987 (pp. 2 222 2 258).;;PCI, Revision 2.1, A100910 940 (pp. 35 55); Jun. 1, 1995.;;DMA Support on the PCIway , Aug. 2, 1995, Version 5.4, Preliminary, pp. 2 16.",EXPIRED

Death is a frequent sequel of systemic vascular wall damage, resulting from exposure to high sugar levels in diabetes and also from high plasma homocyst(e)ine (tHcy) levels that affect much of the population and comprise a major risk factor for vascular disease. Diabetes is similarly widespread. Given (1) widespread and regular consumption of milk, (2) the possibility to control tHcy by treating the underlying folate (and other vitamin) insufficiency, (3) the opportunity to simply include control of neural tube defects and (4) the presumed causal link between diabetes and type A1 with type B casein consumption, the invention offers remediation by supplying a population with a modified milk or milk product including (1) fortification using cobalamin, pyridoxine, folic acid, and betaine, with (2) a substantially type A2 casein fraction only. In addition, exploitation of the immunological properties of beta-casomorphin 9 (a peptide digest fraction of A2 beta-casein) may assist in control of diabetes. Practical and convenient fortified diets include treated, selected milks and food products including derivatives of milk, also selected milks together with treated cereals.",NEW ZEALAND MILK INST LTD;;ELLIOTT ROBERT BARTLETT;;LAUGESEN BRIAN MURRAY,ELLIOTT ROBERT BARTLETT;;LAUGESEN BRIAN MURRAY,,https://lens.org/105-487-097-998-692,Patent Application,yes,5,28,8,9,0,A23C9/158;;A23C9/152;;A23L33/15;;A23L33/19;;A23V2002/00;;A61P3/02;;A61P3/10;;A61P7/00;;A61P9/00;;A61P9/10;;A61P11/06;;A61P15/00;;A61P25/28;;A61P35/00;;A61P37/00;;A61P43/00,A23L1/30;;A23C9/152;;A23C9/158;;A23L1/305;;A23L33/15;;A61K31/205;;A61K31/4415;;A61K31/519;;A61K31/714;;A61K35/20;;A61P3/02;;A61P3/10;;A61P7/00;;A61P9/00;;A61P9/10;;A61P11/06;;A61P15/00;;A61P25/28;;A61P35/00;;A61P37/00;;A61P43/00,,4,2,005-702-373-132-793;;030-083-300-363-052,10.1016/s0950-3536(05)80221-5;;8534962;;9020245;;10.1016/s0002-8223(97)00044-8,"PARODI P.W.: ""Cow's milk folate binding protein: Its role in folate nutrition"", THE AUSTRALIAN J.

One of the feature flags is used as a link bit for each GART table entry such that when the core logic chipset reads selected ones of the GART table entries stored in the system memory, it stores a first one of the selected ones in its cache memory and determines if the link bit thereof is set. If the link bit of the first one of the selected ones is set then a next one of the selected ones is stored in the cache memory and if the link bit thereof is set then a subsequent one of the selected ones is stored in the cache memory until one of the link bits thereof is determined not to be set.",COMPAQ COMPUTER CORP,SANTOS GREGORY N;;ELLIOTT ROBERT C,COMPAQ COMPUTER CORPORATION (1997-09-08);;HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT LP (2015-10-27);;HEWLETT-PACKARD DEVELOPMENT COMPANY L.P (2002-10-01),https://lens.org/163-338-872-948-309,Granted Patent,yes,2,21,4,4,0,G09G5/39;;G09G5/39;;G06F3/14;;G06F3/14;;G06F12/1027;;G06F12/1027;;G06F12/1081;;G06F12/1081;;G09G5/363;;G09G5/363;;G09G2360/121;;G09G2360/121;;G09G2360/125;;G09G2360/125,G06F12/08;;G06F3/14;;G06F12/10;;G06F13/36;;G06T11/00;;G09G5/00;;G09G5/36;;G09G5/39,345/516;;345/503;;345/521;;345/514;;345/526;;711/202,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A pneumatic actuator adapted for placement between a pair of spaced members for controlling relative movement between said members is formed of two different hardness plastic materials and includes a rigid base and a flexible top member forming an internal air chamber therebetween. The top member is movable between collapsed and expanded positions by pressurized air introduced into the internal chamber for relative movement of the spaced members. The base has a sidewall terminating in a peripheral edge on which the top member is sealingly secured by a hot welded joint. A central portion of the top member has a raised thickened portion which engages one of the spaced members. A stop is located within the internal chamber to maintain the central portion of the top member above the peripheral edge of the base to prevent contact of the spaced member with the sealed joint when the top member is in the collapsed position. An air passage is formed in the base to enable the pressurized air to enter the internal chamber.

The South bridge also masks all requests to run cycles on the PCI bus that are not originated by the CPU. The South bridge includes a programmable control register and a PCI arbiter. When a control bit is set in the register, the PCI arbiter waits for FLUSHREQ to be deasserted and then masks FLUSHREQ. The PCI arbiter preferably also disables PCI arbitration by masking all non-CPU. Only the CPU can run PCI cycles when the non-CPU requests are masked. The programmable control register also includes a masking status bit that is set when both the FLUSHREQ and non-CPU request signals are masked by a request mask state machine.
