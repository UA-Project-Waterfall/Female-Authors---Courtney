The press tools 16, 19 are operated by a fly-wheel 10 and crank 13, which also reciprocate an adjustable rod 23 through the disc 20. The rod 23 oscillates the disc 31 through 90 degrees which in turn, through a rod 40, oscillates a block 35 between the adjustable limit stops 50. The block 35 oscillates on a block 34 which is itself oscillated about the horizontal axis by a cam 60 on the disc 31 and a rod 55. The block 35 carries the work-gripping fingers 69, which are operated by a wedge 71 and an air cylinder 7 2 controlled by a valve actuated by a cam on the disc 31. In operation, the block 35 is oscillated to bring the fingers over a blank on a table 76, the block 34 is then moved angularly and the fingers closed to grip the blank. The arm returns and deposits the blank on to the bottom tool 16 as the ram reaches its upper position. For picking up sheets 81, Fig. 6, the fingers 69 may be replaced by a suction cup 80.

[Also in Division H1] In connecting a metal terminal pillar to a plate grid formed of dispersion strengthened lead for a lead acid secondary electric battery, a joint between the grid and the pillar or between the grid and a metal member which is itself secured to the pillar is effected by cold welding. A grid 10, Fig. 1, formed by extrusion and rolling from dispersion strengthened lead has an integral lug 11 with a tapered end 13 and this end 13 is lapped over a strip of lead alloy 12 also having a tapered end 14 in a die 15. A punch 16 having a working face 17 with semicircular ends and rounded edges is applied to the ends 12, 14 at a pressure of 12,200 p.s.i. to weld them together with 50% reduction. The bulging edges of the joint may be sheared off. The strips of a number of grids are then secured to a pillar by burning. In another embodiment, a number of dispersion strengthened lead grids 20 have integral lugs 21, Fig. 3, and these lugs are arranged in grooves 22 in a lead or lead alloy pillar 23 formed with an integral terminal and the pillar is compressed in a press to cold weld the lugs in the grooves.

The feed-mechanism is of the kind described in Specifications 780,203 and 733,347 and is driven by an electric - motor 61 through a clutch 62 and gear-box 57, and includes an arm 40 oscillating horizontally about a vertical pivot 41, Fig. 5 (not shown), between extreme end-positions, i.e. a component pick-up position and a component insertion position. At these positions a platform 10 carrying the arm is rocked about a horizontal pivot, respectively to raise and lower the components. Platform 10 is connected by link 12 to a lever 18 pivoted at 17 and connected at 19 to a vertically-adjustable spindle 21 pivoted at 23 to a curved arm 24. The left-hand end of this arm has a lip 28 cooperating with a cam-projection 29 on a disc 27 secured to the output shaft of the gear-box; the right-hand end is connected to a clutch trip-rod 77. During each manual feed the lip 28 is raised out of the path of the cam 29, but if the feed-movement is less than normal due, e.g. to two components being inserted together, the lip is engaged by the cam, which moves the arm 24 to trip the rod 77 and cause it to release the clutch-engagement lever 65 as described in Specification 780,203, thereby to disengage the feed-mechanism and apply a brake.

May 12, 1958 [May 14, 1957], No. 15341/57. Class 143 [Also in Groups XIX, XXIX and XXXIV] An hydraulic checking and weighing gear comprises an hydraulic transmitter T and a receiver R each having a piston operating in a cylinder, fluid flow means connecting the respective cylinders whereby pressure generated in the transmitter is transmitted to the receiver, and pressure fluid bearings supporting the pistons for movement in their respective cylinders. The apparatus is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1. A pump MP supplies oil to inlets H, H 1 , of the transmitter and receiver units T, R respectively. A pipe P interconnects the outlet ports N 1 , N 2 and ports S, S 1 are connected to the oil sump Weights W, W 1 , are placed on the transmitter and receiver, and when the system is balanced. these weights are in a predetermined ratio. Figs. 2 and 4 show the transmitter T. A piston E is freely slidable in the body of the unit and oil is supplied through restrictions r 1 , to pools G, thus forming upper and lower pressurised bearings, there being four such pools to each bearing. These bearings eliminate any metallic contact between the piston E and its housing. If the pressure of the oil in the pipe P is less than the pressure due to the weights W, the piston E falls and oil from the inlet H passes through a passage a 3 and ducts b 1 , b 2 to a passage J and then into the space K below the piston E. If the pressure of the oil is too great, the piston E rises and the passage J is opened to the drain connection S by way of an annular duct b 3 and a passage R. The pressure in the cylinder K thus balances the pressure due to the weights W, and this pressure is transmitted by the pipe P to the receiver R which consists of a piston of greater diameter supported by similar pressurised bearings in a closed cylinder to which the pipe P leads. Thus a larger weight W 1 is required to balance the weight W. Applications of the apparatus to the testing of weighing-apparatus, measuring the torque exerted by the carcase of a rotary dynamometer, and applying a known load to a strain gauge load cell or a hydrostatic capsule for testing are described. The apparatus may also act as a de-intensifier instead of an intensifier by making the transmitter piston of greater area than the receiving piston.",HEENAN & FROUDE LTD,EVANS GODFREY ARTHUR,,https://lens.org/062-957-257-415-085,Granted Patent,no,0,1,3,3,0,G01G5/04;;G01L1/02;;G01G5/04;;G01L1/02,G01G5/04;;G01L1/02,F1D DP19          DP19;;F2A AD20          AD20;;F2A A202          AD20;;F2A A210          AD20;;F2A A212          AD20;;F2A A213          AD20;;F2A A230          AD20;;F2A A237          AD20;;F2A A240          AD20;;F2A A246          AD20;;F2A A260          AD20;;F2A A272          AD20;;F2A A300          AD20,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Gyromagnetic resonance apparatus. MULLARD Ltd. June 29, 1961 [June 29, 1960], No. 22785/60. Heading G1N. The radio-frequency coil of a gyromagnetic resonance apparatus comprises a conductor of rectangular cross-section wherein the width of the conductor is very much greater than its thickness. Glass cylinder 1 Fig. 1, is electroplated with a thin layer of copper between limits 2, 3 and portions are etched away to form a coil 6 with end strips 13, 14, channels 9-12 being etched away to break what would otherwise be a short circuited turn. The length of the copper plated region should be many times the coil length and the major part of the end portions should be left in situ.

Metal strip feeds. PRESS EQUIPMENT, Ltd. April 10, 1957 [April 10, 1956], No. 10884/56. Class 83 (4). [Also in Group XVI] Strip is fed to abut against a stop beyond the tools or dies of a machine which operate on the strip and as it reaches the stop the strip actuates a switch associated with or adjacent the stop to arrest or slow down the feed and to set the machine in motion to operate on the strip. Strip is fed from a reel 12 by feeding and straightening rolls 14 through a press 10 to abut the stop 24 which determines the length to be cut. The stop 24 consists of a housing 31 carrying the stop member 30 and mounted on a bell-crank lever 45 pivoted on a bracket 34 adjustably secured to a frame 21. A threaded rod engaging the housing 31 and a boss on the bell-crank lever 46 provides a fine adjustment of the stop. When the strip engages a flap 44, the switch 41 is actuated to slow or stop the feed and providing the press ram is at top-dead centre to pneumatically actuate a one-revolution clutch controlling the press. Just after the strip is sheared, a cam on the crank-shaft of the press actuates a valve to pass compressed air temporarily to cylinders 47, 53 which serve respectively to raise the stop-member 30 and to operate a pushbar which pushes the severed strip into a bin 26. The switch 41 releases and the feed rate is returned to normal. When the switch merely slows the feed rate the strip forms a hump 11 on the feed side of the press and this hump may be used to control an arm 83 to vary or stop the feed as an additional control during normal working or to stop the feed should the strip jam in the press. In a press used for blank punching, the stop engages the edge of an opening formed in the strip by a previous operation and is momentarily retracted during the feeding of the strip to clear the web between adjacent openings.",PRESS EQUIPMENT LTD,EVANS FREDERICK ARTHUR,,https://lens.org/044-344-388-677-937,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,B21D43/021,B21D43/02,B8R RRW10         RRW1,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

DISTILLERS CO. Ltd. March 4, 1960 [March 7, 1959], No. 7967/59. Class 38 (4). [Also in Group XXVIII] Vaporizing apparatus for a readily vaporizable liquid such as liquid carbon dioxide or liquid petroleum gases comprises a heating vessel 1 having an inlet port 2 for connection to a storage tank containing the vaporizable liquid and an outlet port 4 for connection to a gas delivery pipe 5, the heating vessel containing three heating elements 7, 8, 9 with an associated temperature responsive device 10, 11, 12 respectively, the temperature responsive devices controlling the supply to the heating elements. Whilst the vaporizer is idle, the liquid vaporizes until the liquid pressure is balanced by the gas pressure in the vessel 1. Opening of a valve 6 allows the gas to be used with a consequent further generation of gas in the vessel 1 with a concomitant drop in the temperature in the vessel. The passage of the liquid through the inlet port 2 causes a temperature responsive device to operate to close a switch 17 whereby the electric supply circuit is closed. The drop of temperature in the vessel 1 causes the temperature responsive devices 10, 11, 12 to operate in succession to close switches 13, 14, 15 respectively so that the heating elements 7, 8, 9 maintain the supply of gas. As the demand for gas diminishes, the temperature at the top of the vessel rises, whereupon the temperature responsive device 12 causes the heating element 9 to be switched off. A further reduction in demand will cause the heating element 8 to be switched off and so on.

Machinery guards. PRESS GUARDS, Ltd. Oct. 29, 1953 [Sept. 15, 1952], No. 23088/52. Class 80 (4). [Also in Group XXXIV] A safety mechanism for a press or milling or other machine comprises a brake applied to a rotating part by a lever which, in the event of danger to an operator (such as on the opening of a guard, operation of a trip bar, or interruption of a light beam), is moved into the path of a cam or other member on the rotating part and applies the brake through a member having a limited yielding movement to relieve the stresses in the brake. As shown, a pair of brake shoes 12, 13, pivoted on a fixed stud 14 are normally held by a spring 20 in light engagement with a drum on the crank-shaft 11 of a press to bring it to rest when the clutch (not shown) is disengaged. A movable guard (not shown) is linked to a lever 26 so that when the guard is opened a horn 23 on a lever 24 is moved into the path of a cam 22 on the crankshaft. The lever 24 carries a roller 31 engaging a surface 32 on the shoe 13, and is pivoted to a link 30 which is pivoted on a pin 33 slidable, against a frictional resistance provided by spring washers or springs, in a slot in the shoe 12. Should the press over-run while the guard is open, the roller 31 is moved over the surface 32 to give a braking pressure additional to that provided by the spring 20, said pressure being limited by the slidable connection 33. Should the brake fail to stop the crank-shaft, the roller 31 engages a projection 37 to provide a positive stop. The cam 22 may be shaped to hold the guard closed during the down stroke of the press, or during the down stroke and part of the up stroke. A switch 38 controlling the driving motor is carried by a lever 39 pivoted to the link 30 and is normally held closed against a flat on a pin 18 on the shoe 13, the end of the lever 39 bearing on the end of a pin 36 which locks the nut of the connection 33. When the brake intensifier is operated the lever 39 is rocked to open the switch 38 and de-energize the driving motor. The switch 38 also provides a warning that the brake shoes need relining, since if the shoes move together more than a predetermined amount the switch 38 rides off the flat on the pin 18 and the motor cannot be started. Should the brake become locked on the drum the pin 36 may be withdrawn and the connection 33 slackened to release the brake, the pin 36 ensuring that the connection is subsequently returned to its original setting. A spring-pressed radial pawl 41 in the path of the cam 22 prevents reverse rotation of the crank-shaft. In a modification an axially-moving pawl co-operates with a notch in the end face of the brake drum. It is stated that the pawl may be withdrawn by the closing of the guard or by the movement of a clutch lever. In a further construction of brake control, Fig. 3 (not shown), the frictional connection 33 is replaced by a resilient connection comprising a compression spring ; the switch 38 is replaced by a switch carried by the brake shoe 13 and operated by an extension of the link connecting the two shoes ; and the spring- loaded pawl 41 is replaced by a gravity-loaded pawl. It is stated that the brake shoes may be replaced by a band brake. For milling and like machines having a continuously-rotating shaft, the cam is replaced by a toothed wheel or serrated disc adapted to apply the brake. According to the Provisional Specification, a guard is coupled to a bell-crank co-operating with the crank-shaft cam, the bell-crank pivoting on a pin which carries a roller engaging an inclined surface on one brake shoe and is yieldingly linked to the other shoe.",PRESS GUARDS LTD,EVANS FREDERICK ARTHUR,,https://lens.org/067-401-562-178-344,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,F16P3/00,F16P3/00,F2E EAB           EAB;;F2E EKM           EKM;;F2E E2M1AX2       EAB;;F2E E2M1B3A       EAB;;F2E E2M1B4F       EAB;;F2E E2M1B5A3      EAB,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Feeding sheets. PRESS EQUIPMENT Ltd. March 4, 1957 [Dec. 2, 1955; March 7, 1956], Nos. 34516/55 and 7154/56. Class 100(1) Single sheet feeds; control &c. devices :- Mechanism for feeding blanks or components to power presses &c, comprises mechanism driven as a unit and serving to pick up components and to feed them into and remove them from intermittently operating tools, in combination with automatically operating safety means whereby the feeding mechanism is stopped or the setting in motion of the means for actuating the tools is prevented if the various steps in the feeding of a component do not take place normally in relation to the operation of the tools. The feeding mechanism may be applied to a single press, or for feeding components through a number of sets of tools in separate presses assembled in line. In the form shown in Figs. 1 and 3, the press is one of a number of power presses operating sequentially on blanks or components which are fed from one press to other by suction grippers 34. Each frame 10 is open in end view, the frames are all in one straight line, and the tools and blank feeding means of each press are driven from a crankshaft 11. The feeding means comprises a stationary longitudinally extending bar 12, and a carriage 13 mounted for vertical movements thereon by means of bell-crank levers 14 pivoted at 15. The vertical arms of these levers are connected together by rods 17, and one of the vertical arms is connected to the piston rod of a fluid-pressure cylinder 18, which causes raising and lowering of the carriage 13. Sliding movement is imparted to the carriage 13 by a rod 21, a lever 22 secured on a shaft 23 mounted in a frame bracket, an arm 25 secured on the shaft 23, a rod 26 of adjustable length, and a bell-crank lever 27 which urges the rod 26 through the medium of two compression springs 30. The other end of the lever 27 carries a roller engaging a cam groove 29 in a face cam fixed on the crankshaft 11. The stroke of this drive assembly is limited by micrometer stops 33 on the lever 22 co-operating with fixed abutments. Two suction pick-up heads 34, spaced at intervals on the carriage 13 equal to half the spacing between the tools of adjacent presses, are connected through a valve 36 and a flexible pipe to a source of vacuum. The shape of the cam groove 29 is such that the feed assembly 12, 13 is stationary ion a neutral position in which the pick-up heads 34 are midway between the tools of adjacent presses, the assembly then moves in one direction to bring the first head 34 over a loading table and the second head 34 over the bottom tool &c. of the press. The carriage 13 is now lowered, blanks &c. are picked up from the loading table and tools, respectively, by the two heads 34, the carriage is raised, the assembly is moved in the opposite direction to carry the blank from the loading table above the tools of the press, and blank from the press over the next loading table. The carriage is now lowered and the blanks released. The loading tables may be omitted, and the pick-up heads may transfer the blariks from the tools of one press to the next. The safety control mechanism, shown in Fig. 3, includes a connecting pipe 42 between one suction pick-up head 34 to a vacuum switch 43 in series with a switch 44 controlled by a cam 45 on the press crankshaft 11. These switches are in the circuit of a solenoid 46 of a valve 47 which controls a compressed air cylinder 48 for operating the extractor 49 of the key clutch of the press. If a blank or component is not picked up by either of the suction heads 34, the switch 43 remains closed and, when the switch 44 is closed, the solenoid 46 is energised and opens the valve 47 which energises the cylinder 48 and the extractor 49 is retracted, whereupon the clutch is not engaged and the press does not make its next stroke. The cylinder 18 for raising and lowering the carriage 13 is supplied with compressed air through a valve controlled by, a solenoid in a circuit containing a switch which is closed twice by cams during each rotation of the crankshaft 11. The air cylinder 18 may be single acting, in which case the carriage 13 is lowered by a spring or under gravity. In the modification shown diagrammatically in Fig. 8, the blank &c. feeding means is driven independently of the press, and is controlled by a motor-driven cam shaft 80 (not shown) which also controls the starting operations of the press. As before, a stationary bar has a gripper carriage 61 mounted for vertical movements thereon by bell-crank levers, and the carriage is reciprocated over the bar by a double-ended compressed air cylinder 63 divided by a central partition into two aligned cylinders, the piston of one being connected to a fixed member, and the piston of the other being connected bv a linkage to the feed carriage. The carriage 61, which is raised and lowered by a compressed air cylinder 70, carries a number of spaced grippers each having pairs of jaws operated by an air cylinder 74 associated with a detector switch 76 which is actuated if the jaws fail to grip a blank or component. The press is set in motion when a pedal 78 is depressed by an air cylinder 77. The cam shaft 80 (not shown) is driven from an electric motor, and cams 79 thereon control air valves 93, 96 and 97 in a compressed air system, and electric switches 108 and 111. Compressed air from a main pipe 92 passes through the valve 93 to the cylinder 70, through a valve 94 to the cylinders 74 of the grippers, through a solenoidoperated valve 95 and the valves 96, 97 to the double-ended cylinder 63, and through a pipe 105 and a solenoid-operated valve 106 to the cylinder 77. A switch 98 in the circuit of the valve 95 is actuated by a cam 99 on the crankshaft 100 of the press. When the press is started, the switch 98 is closed, the solenoid valve 95 is closed to cut off air to the valves 96, 97, but air is allowed to pass by way of pilot line 101 and shuttle valves 102, 103 to return the feeding mechanism to a neutral position, if it is not already there. In the circuit of the valve 106, a switch 107 is closed by the carriage 61 when the latter returns to neutral position, and the switch 108 is operated by a cam 79. If the carriage has not returned to the neutral position, the solenoid is not energised and the press is not set in motion. A branch air pipe 109 between the valve 106 and air cylinder 77 leads to a pressure operated switch 110 which is normally open but is closed when the cylinder 77 is energised. This switch is in parallel with the cam-operated switch 111 in the circuit of the motor driving the cam shaft 80 (not shown), and the switch 111 is in series with the detector switches 76 on the grippers for the blanks &c. If either of the grippers fails to pick up a blank the corresponding switch 76 opens and the motor is stopped. If the carriage 61 has not returned to neutral position, the cylinder 77 is not energised to trip the press clutch, the switch 110 will not be closed, and the cam shaft motor is stopped. The motor is controlled by a starter unit 112 and control unit 113. The valve 94 is opened by the downward movement of the carriage 61 so that the gripper cylinders 74 are energised to close the grippers on to the blanks &c. The spacing of the grippers and the cycle of operations of the feeding assembly is substantially as described in respect of Figs. 1 and 3. Grippers:-The grippers used in the second construction each comprise an angularly adjustable arm, two gripper jaws pivotally mounted at the outer end of the arm so that the two inner limbs of the jaws engage a wedge which is moved along the arm to open and close the jaws, an air cylinder 74, Fig. 8, mounted on the arm and connected with the wedge, and a detector switch 76, Fig. 8, also on the arm and which is actuated if the travel of the wedge exceeds a predetermined amount owing to the failure of the jaws to grasp a blank or component. When the switch 76 is actuated, the motor driving the main cam shaft is stopped.",PRESS EQUIPMENT LTD,EVANS FREDERICK ARTHUR,,https://lens.org/150-388-718-938-851,Granted Patent,no,0,3,1,1,0,B21D43/025,B21D43/02,B8R RAA7          RAA7;;B8R R10E3         RAA7;;B8R R10F          RAA7;;B8R R10M          RAA7;;B8R R10R10        RAA7;;B8R R10R5         RAA7,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Nov. 19, 1956, No. 35320/56. Class 38 (4). In a system for controlling the temperature of an electric furnace supplied through at least one grid controlled gaseous discharge device, a D.C. error voltage is derived from a D.C. voltage indicative of furnace temperature and converted to an A.C. voltage wherein the phase and magnitude are indicative of the error, the A.C. being added to a further A.C. voltage to produce a phase modulated sine wave signal which is converted to time spaced voltage spikes for controlling the firing of the tube. The difference in voltage between a thermocouple 15, Fig. 2, in an induction furnace 13 from which it is desired to draw a germanium crystal and a thermocouple 17 in melting ice, is opposed by a battery 30 in a potentiometer 19-26 to produce a zero error signal input to chopper 31 at the predetermined temperature. The chopper output, after amplification and shaping in a unit 35 is applied with an alternating voltage from phase A to the two grids of a double-triode 36 having a common anode load 40, a phase difference of 90 degrees being achieved by a phase-shifting network 3 7 in the phase A supply. A sine wave signal is thus produced in line 42 the phase of which changes with crucible temperature and when applied to phase-shifting network 43 produces at the grids of "" thyratrons "" 51-53 which are normally negatively biased. Three spiked pulses at identical time positions with respect to the cycles of the three phases of the mains supply, the time position being determined by the signal phase so that the input power to the furnace and thus the furnace temperature is continuously controlled. A meter 125 is provided for the initial adjustment of the system and thermocouples of platinum and 90 per cent platinum, 10 per cent rhodium are stated to be most satisfactory. The system may be modified for any number of phases and for full-wave working. In a modification, Fig. 3, a self-balancing potentiometer 60 is introduced and the chopper and phase modulating valve 36 are replaced, between terminals 27, 28 and 58, 59, by a continuously variable phaseshifting circuit including a saturable reactor 72 the control winding of which is in the anode circuit of an amplifier valve 66. Improved sensitivity to sudden changes is provided by a resistor 67 and a condenser 68, and internal feed-back is produced by R.F. induction in a single turn pick-up 79 placed near the generator output coils. A stabilizing rate-of-change signal which is applied also to the grid of amplifier 66 is derived from a quartz rod 92 in heat transfer relation with the furnace, and a photo-electric cell 93 which detects the infrared emission therefrom. A cam programme arrangement, which utilizes a reversible motor to adjust the datum set by the potentiometer whereby the temperature may be controlled in conjunction with the withdrawal of the crystal is described with reference to Fig. 5 (not shown). Performance figures for the system are given and the operation of the continuously variable phase-shifting network is described.",TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INC,EVANS ARTHUR DUNN,,https://lens.org/193-052-328-833-035,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,G05D23/2237,G05D23/22,G3R RA272         BQ44;;G3R RA273         BQ44;;G3R RA28          BQ44;;G3R RA33          BQ44;;G3R RA522         BQ44;;G3R RBQ44         BQ44;;G3R RB4723        BQ44;;G3R RB473         BQ44,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Class 89(3) A stapling device for securing a staplelike stop member 10, Fig. 5, to a slide fastener or a pair of slide fasteners, comprises a driving plunger 3, Fig. 1, a reciprocatable towards and away from a stapling anvil 2, the plunger having at its lower end two clips 22, Fig. 8, having inwardly bent lower parts 23 between which a stop member 10 is received from a passageway defined between two curved guides 13, 15, Fig. 4. The clips 22 are pivoted to a pin 28 slidable in a slot 34 in the plunger 3 and are biased inwardly at their lower ends 23 by springs 32 to hold the stop member 10 at the lower end of the plunger 3 during downward movement of the plunger, until the prongs 16, 17 of the stop member 10 engage the anvil 2, in which position further downward movement of the clips 22 is prevented by engagement of the pin 28 with shoulders 35 in brackets 31. Thereafter continuing downward movement of the plunger 3 to clinch the prongs 16, 17 forces stop member 10 downwardly past the clip ends 23 causing the clips 22 to yield outwardly to release the stop member. Upon upward movement of the plunger 3 after the clinching operation the clips 22 are moved into their original position to receive another stop member 10 from the passageway between the guides 13, 15. The stop members 10 are fed to the guides 13,15 from a hopper 7 which includes a baffle 14 for ensuring that the stop members pass one at a time to a bridge 12 connecting the guide 13 to the hopper 7. Deflecting surfaces are incorporated in the bridge 12 for tipping any sideways lying stop members on to their backs, while other stop members are rejected from the bridge 12 on meeting the guide 15, and fall through an opening 20 thereof or from the end of the bridge into a container 21. The machine is operated through a lever 5, either by a treadle or electrically. The hopper 7 may be vibrated, either by hand or by lever 5.

Closuring containers. METAL BOX CO., Ltd. Feb. 20, 1953 [April 28, 1952], No. 10708/52. Class 125 (2) In apparatus of the kind described in Specification 450,093 wherein screw closures are fed on to supports 6 beneath a plunger 7 which descends and rotates to carry the closure thr;ough the supports and apply it to a container, the closures pass by gravity down a shoot 5 having a resilient gate at its exit end and are pushed one at a time past the gate on to the supports 6 by a reciprocating member. As shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 4, a platform 1 is fitted with spaced brackets 2 the tops of which carry bars 3 the front ends of which are attached to the supports 6 and the rear ends of which carry each am inwardly facing U-shaped channel which co-operate to form the shcot 5. The spacing at the brackets 2 iis adjustable to suit different diameters of closure. The resilient gate is formed by spring plungers 13 carried on the shoot, the tension being adjustable by screws 14. A tongue 39 prevents a closure from rising when ejected 'from the shoot. If the gate jams, the closure forces down :a pivoted plate 15 against a spring 17 to allow ejection of the closure. Platform 1 carries spaced guides 23 for a slider 22 carrying a vertical arm 26 pivoted between two lugs 25. Two bars 21 extend forwardly from the arm 26 and carry at their front end a depending fork 18 entering between the two parts of the shoot. Bars 21 are normally urged to the position shown by a spring 32 acting an ,a projection 29 of the arm 26. A lever 35 engages between two rollers 34 carried on the top of arm 26 .and is reciprocated by a cam 38 through links 40, 41, 42. When the lever 35 moves to the right, Fig. 4, it first tilts the arm 26 clockwise against spring 32 to cause the fork 18 to enter the shoot to feed a closure past the resilient gate during advancement of the slider 22. When the lever moves to the left, spring 32 raises the fork to clear the next closure to be fed and then the slider is restored to its lefthand position. A stop 44 normally engages grooves in the guides 23 and in the slider 22 to prevent advancement of the latter but when a container approaches the capping station it actuates a lever 48 which withdraws the stop 44 against spring action to allow the feed of a closure. Altenatively, an approaching container may actuate directly the lever 35. In a modification, Fig. 5, an approaching container actuates am arm 48a to rock a shaft 59 which results in a plate 54 pivoting downwardly about its pivot 55. This causes descent of a rod 50 having a head 18a formed with an inclined susface 49 which enters between the first and second closure in the shoot 5a to feed the former past the resilient gate 11a. The parts are restored by a spring 63.",METAL BOX CO LTD,EVANS ARTHUR JAMES PERCIVAL,,https://lens.org/115-834-416-179-114,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,B67B3/062;;B67B3/064,B67B3/062;;B67B3/064,B8U UEB           EB;;B8U U305          EB;;B8U U409          EB,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The pigment may be incorporated into a paper in the final beating stage; one or more of the sheets containing the pigment may then be impregnated with a urea formaldehyde or melamine formaldehyde or phenol formaldehyde resin, the sheets thus produced being then subjected to a temperature of 120-150 DEG C. and a pressure of 2000-2700 lbs per sq. inch whereby the resin is cured. In the example papers containing two pigments according to the invention and one used for comparisons only are impregnated with melamine formaldehyde resin and form the facings of a laminate comprising brown unpigmented craft paper bonded with a phenolic resin. The boards thus produced are irradiated with artificial light of a spectral composition identical to sunlight and the pigments according to the invention show superior light stability.",BRITISH TITAN PRODUCTS,EVANS ARTHUR WALLACE;;SHORE CYRIL,,https://lens.org/007-127-309-659-931,Granted Patent,no,0,9,2,3,0,C09C1/3661;;C01P2004/84,C09C1/36,B5S S17Y;;B5S S189;;B5S S22Y;;B5S S239;;B5S S25X;;B5S S250;;B5S S253;;B5S S30X;;B5S S300;;B5S S301;;B5S S302;;B5S S303;;B5S S55Y;;B5S S565;;B5S S570;;B5S S571;;B5S S572;;B5S S62Y;;B5S S621;;B5S S68X;;B5S S682;;B5S S69X;;B5S S746;;C1A AN34          AVF2;;C1A AVF2          AVF2;;C1N N212          -;;C1N N213          -;;C1N N251          -;;C1N N261          -;;C1N N269          -;;C1N N277          -;;C1N N278          -;;C1N N279          -;;C1N N28X          -;;C1N N284          -;;C1N N289          -;;C1N N29X          -;;C1N N290          -;;C1N N291          -;;C1N N296          -;;C1N N297          -;;C1N N298          -;;C1N N299          -;;C1N N30X          -;;C1N N300          -;;C1N N301          -;;C1N N302          -;;C1N N303          -;;C1N N347          -;;C1N N35Y          -;;C1N N354          -;;C1N N357          -;;C1N N358          -;;C1N N367          -;;C1N N391          -;;C1N N402          -;;C1N N404          -;;C1N N405          -;;C1N N412          -;;C1N N43X          -;;C1N N432          -;;C1N N433          -;;C1N N436          -;;C1N N440          -;;C1N N448          -;;C1N N45Y          -;;C1N N450          -;;C1N N46X          -;;C1N N470          -;;C1N N502          -;;C1N N509          -;;C1N N515          -;;C1N N516          -;;C1N N52Y          -;;C1N N525          -;;C1N N526          -;;C1N N534          -;;C1N N538          -;;C1N N540          -;;C1N N543          -;;C1N N544          -;;C1N N545          -;;C1N N553          -;;C1N N555          -;;C1N N561          -;;C1N N564          -;;C1N N567          -;;C1N N581          -;;C1N N587          -;;C1N N592          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Brick, pottery, and like kilns.-The draught passages in the floor of a ceramic kiln are provided with shrouding-means whereby accumulation of dust and rubbish in and around the passages is prevented and a clear passage for the draught is maintained. Fig. 1 shows the application of the invention to a kiln provided with lower, middle, and upper floors 1, 2, 3. The draught passages 9 in the floor 2 are provided with pipes 10 placed over or around them. The tubes are preferably provided with caps 11 and the upper ends of the pipes 10 may be notched as shown at 12. A modified form of shrouding-means consists of a mushroom cap provided with legs arranged to stand over the hole, or the legs may pass down through the hole and stand on the lower floor. In a further modification, the pipes are arranged to pass through the middle floor and rest on the bottom floor or almost reach it. In the case where the pipes rest on the bottom floor, holes or notches are provided in the pipe. When it is desired to reduce the draught, some of the tubes may he stopped by a plug cap. In the arrangement shown in Fig. 1, the gases from the fire-places 6 pass through the flues 16 into the kiln and thence down through the floor 3, shrouding pipes 10, and outlets 8 in the lower floor to the chimney flue 7.",NORMAN WILLIAM ARTHUR;;EVANS EDWARD,NORMAN WILLIAM ARTHUR;;EVANS EDWARD,,https://lens.org/065-559-344-501-665,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,F27B17/005,F27B17/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The latter may be provided as a water-soluble thorium salt, e.g. ThCl4, Th (NO3)4nH2O, or as a thorium compound with high vapour pressure below 1000 DEG C., e.g. thorium oxide, hydroxide, carbonate, oxalate, sulphate, phosphate or sulphide, the thorium content of which, in the case of batchwise fluidized bed operation, constitutes 0.01-5% of the bed material, or in the case of continuous bed operation or of the introduction of reactants into an empty chamber constitutes 0.001-10% of the theoretical yield of TiO2. The reaction is carried out autothermally at 800-1400 DEG C. and is initiated by preheating of the reactants, combustion of a fuel in the reactor, or electrical means. A bed of silica, zirconia, alumina, titania, zircon or mixtures thereof may be used, fluidized by the reactant vapours or nitrogen. The reactant vapours may include halides of aluminium, zirconium, silicon, antimony or phosphorus as rutilizing-agents, e.g. mixed aluminium and silicon halides as disclosed in Specification 986,660.

The tetrachloride may be fed admixed with the oxygen-containing gas or as a jet of gas or liquid to the perforated plate on which the bed rests or to a point in the fluidized bed. If desired fuel gases such as carbon monoxide may be mixed with the reactants or separately fed to the bed to supply heat, or heat may be supplied from an external source. The temperature of the bed may be from 700-1200 DEG C., preferably 800-950 DEG C. for anastase production and 800-1100 DEG C. for rutile production.

Metals specified are titanium aluminium zirconium. Halide specified:-chloride. Oxygenating gas specified:-air or O2. Particulate size specified:-50-2000 m . The second halide is introduced at a distance above the first so that the first is oxidized before contact with second. The first halide may be a mixture of those specified or may be the same as the second and preferably forms sub-pigmentary particles of oxide. When the first and second halides are the same the amount introduced as the first halide is in the range 5-90% of the whole halide introduced. When they are different the first is in the range 0.5-10% of the total weight of metal oxide produced. The oxygenating gas may be introduced at any point in the bed or mixed with the first metal halide. The second metal halide is added so that it mixes rapidly and uniformly with the products of the first reaction. To the reactants may be added an alkali metal halide (potassium specified), water or silicon halide in the range 0.001-5% of the total weight of metal oxide produced. In an example a bed of particulate TiO2 was heated to 1050 DEG C. and TiCl4, preheated to 200 DEG C. and containing SiCl4 in an amount to give 0.125% silica by weight of the TiO2 produced, was passed in as a first halide. Oxygen preheated to 150 DEG C. and containing AlCl3 to give 0.62% alumina by weight of the TiO2 produced was passed in at the same level. Above these inlets is introduced preheated TiCl4.

The reaction is effected in the bed and the oxide product is for the most part discharged in entrainment with the outgoing gases. The oxide accretion on the bed particles is maintained at or below 20% by weight of the inert solids material. The reactants are introduced, preferably separately, through a plurality of inlet ducts distributed across the bed cross-section and the inlet ducts are provided with constrictions each of which produces a pressure drop which is at least one half of the pressure drop from the bottom to the top of the fluidized bed. The fluidized bed may be as described in Specification 761,770, i.e. the particle size should be from 40-1000 microns, and temperature of the bed is normally between 800 DEG and 1300 DEG C. A proportion of the ozide product forms as an accretion on the bed particles and accordingly a portion of the bed may be withdrawn and cleaned, for example by chlorination. The reactants, namely the halide and oxygen are normally employed in stoichiometric amounts, but oxygen to chloride ratios from 0,75:1 to 4:1 may be employed. Withdrawal of the bed solids may be employed as a cooling means since such solids may be withdrawn and cooled or fed at any temperature desired to obtain adequate cooling and adequate purging of oxide accretion from the bed particles. The apparatus employed is described and claimed in Specification 919,020 and the orifices in the perforated base of the fluidized bed may be provided with means to bar ingress of the bed material to the fluidizing gas supply, as described in Specifications 724,193, 794,666 and 813,489. According to examples (1) a vertical steel shaft furnace was provided with a perforated base fitted with manifolds feeding titanium tetrachloride and oxygen. A zircon sand bed of 150 microns average diameter was preheated to 1100 DEG C. and the reaction temperature was thereafter maintained at 980 DEG C., overheating being prevented by feeding and removing zircon sand. A minor quantity of water may be added to the oxygen reactant stream. (3) Aluminium trichloride and oxygen were separately fed to a fluidized bed of zircon sand which was maintained at 1000 DEG C. throughout the reaction by withdrawing zircon sand and feeding in cool sand. Aluminium oxide of 0,07 microns diameter was obtained.

The zirconium values may be recovered from the roasted product by digesting with a mineral acid, preferably in excess, and lixiviating with water, preferably at elevated temperature, to dissolve the zirconium. The digestion with the mineral acid, for example hydrochloric or nitric, preferably sulphuric, acid, is carried out such that the treated material is in the form of a slurry, paste or, preferably, a substantially dry pulverulent mass. Advantageously dilute acid may be added during the lixiviation with water. The mixing prior to roasting is preferably carried out in the dry state for example in a drum with vanes, or it may be mixed as a slurry or paste, and either dried or fed as it is to the roasting, which may be carried out in stationary or moving hearth furnaces either in crucibles or directly, or preferably either in batches or continuously in a rotary furnace in which it undergoes mixing during the roasting.

Phosgene may be used as oxygen acceptor and halogen. Silica, e.g. zircon or spent bauxite clay containing at least 25% wt. SiO2, and of particle size 76-1000m , is suspended in a molten halide bath in which the halide is preferably the same as the halogen gas employed. The carbon may be coke, graphite or anthracite having a particle size 50m to 2 inches and usually at least twice the average size of the silica employed. The reaction in the presence of carbon, which may be added before or during reaction with the halogen, is generally assisted by external heating, electric induction heating or by the heat produced by the addition of O2 to react with the carbon. Carbon monoxide, which may be added at the same time e.g. in admixture with, the halogen supplied to the melt, causes an exothenuic reaction and the process proceeds autothermally. Reaction temperatures below 1100 DEG C. e.g. 600 DEG -1000 DEG C. may be employed. In order to accelerate the reaction in the presence of carbon, boron or boron compounds e.g. boron halides or boron compounds which react with the halogen in situ to produce boron halides, for example, boron carbides, ferro-boron, anhydrous boric oxide or metal borides e.g. alkali metal or alkaline earth metal borates especially borax, may be incorporated as catalysts in the melt. Preferably such catalysts are halides of the same halogen as the halogen gas employed, are volatile e.g. Bcl3, and are added to the melt in the halogen gas. The boron halides may be recovered from the reaction products and recycled.

Feeding sheets. THOMPSON & CO. Ltd., R. D. H. Aug. 26, 1960 [May 27, 1959], No. 18116/59. Class 100 (1). Apparatus for feeding sheets of material to a machine comprises means for feeding the sheets 4 into a pile from underneath the pile, a plate 6 spaced above the pile, a back lay 8 transverse to and adjacent to one end of the plate, means for blowing gas streams on to the underside of the plate 6 so as to blow the topmost sheets of the pile against the back lay 3 and to hold them in a state of suspension, floating and separate from one another, and means for engaging the floating sheets and feeding them one at a time towards the machine. Feeding belts 2 run up an inclined ramp 1 at the upper end of which is a vertical wall 3. The pile of sheets is disposed between the wall 3 and the back lay 8. Rollers 10 are mounted at the lower end of the back lay. A drum 11 having rubber suckers 12 located around its periphery is mounted above the plate 6, the suckers 12 projecting through a hole 7 in the plate when the drum is rotated. As each sucker passes through the hole 7 it is connected, via a hollow shaft upon which the drum is mounted, with a source of suction. At the front end of the pile a horizontal pipe 18 having nozzles 19 is mounted. During operation, compressed-air is blown continuously through the nozzles 19 whereby the top sheets of the pile are separated from one another and are held suspended in the air streams.

A suitable apparatus comprises a furnace at the bottom of which is introduced initially air or oxygen and subsequently chlorine gas. The chlorine reacts with a finely ground heated mixture of titanium ore and powdered carbon which is introduced at the top of the furnace. A continuous process is maintained by volatilizing all ore-impurities in addition to the titanium as their respective chlorides so that the composition of the reaction mixture remains constant. The volatile chlorides and a small proportion of very fine solid particles are passed to the base of a column which is fitted at the top with a reflux condenser and at the bottom with a reboiler containing titanium tetrachloride. A small proportion of the condensed titanium tetrachloride is taken off continuously from the condenser and purified. The remainder is returned down the column where it condenses uprising gases and carries condensed chloride impurities &c. down to the reboiler. Solids are removed from the reboiler as a slurry from which titanium tetrachloride is recovered.

The process is carried out using dispersed preferably fluidized material in an atmosphere of oxygen or oxygen and an inert gas. The material may be ground before treating in the fluidized bed which may be partially made up of fine inert particulate material and to which a portion of the product may be returned. The fluidized bed may be heated externally and part of the heat is supplied by burning some of the sulphur in oxygen. Waste sulphuric acid may be used in the leaching process wherein ferrous sulphate is produced and may be recovered. Sulphur and sulphur dioxide are recovered from the heating process which at preferably 600 DEG C. and above is hot enough to vaporize the sulphur. Excess sulphur is used and may be obtained from hydrogen sulphide or iron pyrites as well as elemental sulphur. The sulphur and oxygen containing gases may be preheated before passing into the fluidized bed which may be a batch or continuous process.

July 18, 1968 [Aug. 17, 1967], No.37871/67. Headings G1A and G1U. In a system for measuring current on a high voltage conductor C by using the Faraday effect, interference effects caused by current in an adjacent conductor TC are reduced by using two spaced Faraday effect bodies Y1, Y2 spaced in the field of the current to be measured, a plane polarized infrared beam being passed through the two bodies in turn in such a direction that the effects on the two bodies of the field due to the adjacent current effectively cancel. In one system infrared light is directed via a fibre optic FO1 to a polariser P1 through one body Y1 and is then reflected by two mirrors (to give 360 degrees phase change) through the second body Y2 analyser P2, fibre optic FO2 to a detector D. The current being measued may be a very high A. C. which will result in a modulated output from the detector which must be demodulated. Alternatively A.C. may be measured, in which case the effect of attenuation in the light path is reduced by inserting a further body to which a reference A. C. is applied and determining the depth of modulation at the detector, which represents the ratio of the reference A.C. to the unknown D.C. In alternative arrangements, both Faraday bodies may be between the conductors C and IC Fig. 3 (not shown) and the system of mirrors M1, M2 may be replaced by a U-shaped light guide Fig. 5 (not shown), a further analyser and polarizer being inserted in the light path since such a guide will cause the loss of any polarization information in the light passing into it. The provisional Specification describes an arrangement using any one magneto optic body set in a magnetic shield surrounding the test conductor to reduce external interference effects.",MULLARD LTD,EVANS BRIAN ARTHUR;;PEARSON RONALD FERGUSON,,https://lens.org/060-046-764-625-191,Granted Patent,no,0,6,4,4,0,G01R15/246;;G02F1/09,G01R15/24;;G02F1/09,G1A ACFF          CFF;;G1A AR6           CFF;;G1A A246          4;;G1A A248          4;;G1A A269          4;;G1A A356          4;;G1A A358          4;;G1A A369          4;;G1A A402          4;;G1A A407          4;;G1A A446          4;;G1A A448          4;;G1A A449          4;;G1A A456          4;;G1A A458          4;;G1A A459          4;;G1A A469          4;;G1A A474          4;;G1A A482          4;;G1A A566          4;;G1A A568          4;;G1A A569          4;;G1A A573          4;;G1A A58Y          4;;G1A A581          4;;G1A A589          4;;G1A A70Y          4;;G1A A700          4;;G1A A703          4;;G1A A78Y          4;;G1A A782          4;;G1U UBV2          UBV2;;G1U U5A1          CD;;G1U U5A2          CD;;G1U U5B1          CD;;G1U U5C7          CD;;G1U U5M19         CD;;G1U U5M3B         CD,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The fluidized bed is supported on a plate having perforations fitted with insert members defining orifices of reduced diameter. Titanium tetrachloride together with ferric chloride and other contaminating chlorides are simultaneously formed and removed together as a single gaseous mixture whilst the less readily chlorinated constituents accumulate in the bed from which they are periodically or continuously removed. The ore feed is preferably of 80-180 micron size whilst that of the carbon or coke is approximately twice this size. The gases enter the furnace at 2-50 times the minimum fluidizing velocity and the reaction temperature is maintained within the range of 500-1000 DEG C. According to an example the bed was formed of 1 part powdered coke and 4 parts of rutile sand which contained 1.2% of zircon. The bed was initially fluidized by admitting air and heating with a gas flame to 900 DEG C., after which air was cut off and chlorine fed at 15 DEG C. The bed was supported upon a perforated plate, the pressure drop across which was 3 1/2 lbs./square inch, and slightly less than the pressure drop across the bed. Titanium tetrachloride was fed through the top of the reaction vessel in a solid stream which fell into and, by evaporation, cooled the bed and maintained the temperature at 870 DEG C. The zircon content of the bed built up to 40% after which air flow replaced chlorine and a portion of the bed was removed through a port in the side of the reactor. Fresh rutile and coke was then added and chlorination continued.",BRITISH TITAN PRODUCTS,EVANS ARTHUR WALLACE;;GROVES JAMES DENNIS,,https://lens.org/110-906-456-437-673,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,C22B34/1222,C22B34/12,C1A AD10          AP10;;C1A AD41          AP10;;C1A AP10          AP10,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The excess acid employed is at least 90% in excess of the amount required to form titanyl sulphate and the alumina addition is such that the amount of such excess is reduced to 0 to 80%. The titanium/aluminium ration, on an oxide basis, is preferably from 1:0,5 to 1:4. Thus titanium dioxide in the form of the finished pigment or as a pigment intermediate product may be dissolved in 95-97% sulphuric acid in the proportion from 2-13 mols. of sulphuric acid per mol of titanium dioxide at a temperature of 140-150 DEG C., the temperature being maintained by steam heating. Hydrated alumina may then be added at a 100-160 DEG C., after which the reaction medium is diluted with water to a concentration of 20-100 grams/litre of TiO2 and the solids residue separated by decanting or filtering. The final solution obtained may be employed to coat other pigments such as titanium dioxide, or titanates, or composite pigments such as titanium dioxide in admixture with barium sulphate or carbonate, or in admixture with zinc oxide. In such a case, after the solution has been mixed with the pigment, an acid binding substance such as the alkali, metal alkaline earth metal, magnesium and ammonium hydroxides, oxides or carbonate or organic bases are added.

Bookbinding.-A method of applying a back or cover to a book by means of a heat-sealable adhesive interposed between end papers or end pages of the book and the back, includes the steps of feeding the book in an upright position with the spine uppermost, opening out the end papers or end pages so that they form a substantial T-shape with the book body, the papers or pages forming the top arm of the T, positioning a back in register with the end papers or pages, spot-sealing the latter to the back, and then completing the heat-sealing operation of the back to the end papers. As described, the machine is for covering a diary with a soft cover, but it can be used for hard-backed books with round or square spines, in which case the spotsealing operation may be carried out with the end papers and backs lying at an angle of 45 degrees to the vertical. The plan view of Fig. 1 shows operation stations 1 to 6, stations 2, 3, 5, and 6 each being formed from two mirrorimage halves located one on each side of a centre-line XX but only one half of each being shown. At station 1 a stack of uncovered diaries with spines uppermost is placed between side walls to rest on feed tapes 8 which are driven intermittently in the direction. C. The foremost diary is ejected lengthwise in the direction I by a pusher to station 2 where the thickness is checked by side bars which act as a brake, and operate a microswitch to stop the machine if the diary is too thick. Compressed air is directed from below and at each end of the diary to blow upwardly the end papers or pages, and opposed suction pads 10 engage the end papers and open them to lie at 45 degrees to the diary body. The diary body is then gripped by opposed grippers 14, Fig. 12, and carried to station 3, the end papers moving over fixed ploughs 63 which raise the papers to make an angle of 90 degrees to the diary body 65. A rubber pad 68 on an arm 67 bears on, and breaks the stiffness of, the diary spine during the passage through station 3. The grippers 14 return to station 2, and another set, which have returned from station 5, grip and transfer the diary to station 5 where side plates 26 support the end papers at right angles to the diary, and a back or cover is placed thereover. The cover is transferred from a table 29 by an arm 27, pivoted at 28, and both the diary and the cover are registered at the front and rear by jogger plates 70, 72 operated by a shaft 31. The end papers and cover are also registered at the sides by channel-shaped members and bars secured to slidable blocks 42, Fig. 12, and the cover and end papers are bowed upwardly. In this condition, silicone-rubber pads 47 on arms 48 descend on each side of the diary, and heatspotting blocks 49 rise through apertures in the plates 26 and press the cover and end papers against the pads 47. The blocks 42, pads 47, and blocks 49 are actuated, respectively, by arms 50, 52 and 53, each provided with adjusting means. Since either the end papers or the inside of the cover has been previously coated with a dried heat-sealable adhesive, the cover and end papers are thus spot-welded together. A set of grippers 14 now transfers the covered diary to station 6 where the end papers and attached cover fall from the T-position to a 45- degree position to lie over heated platens 120, Fig. 12, and silicone-rubber pads 121 descend to press the cover sides on to the platens to completely heat-seal them to the end papers. Each pad 121 is adjustable by screws 126, and carried by a slide 122 which is reciprocated in a frame 123 by toggle link means 124 and a pusher rod 125. As described, there are three stations 6 to ensure complete heat-sealing, and in each succeeding station the platens 120 are raised by a small amount so as to engage more closely between the diary body and end papers as close to the spine as possible. At station 4 the covers or backs are stacked on edge in a trough and are urged in the direction D against a front stop by two tapes 55 which are driven intermittently. As shown in Fig. 13, covers 83 are separated sequentially from the stack by telescopic sucker arms 80, and placed on a table 29. If the diary cover 83 has a pencil loop in the spine, slidable sections 100 of the table 29 move inwardly to form the loop, and pairs of grippers operated by a pneumatic device 104, 105 close over the loop and preform it. The cover is subsequently fed from table 29 to station 5 by the swinging arm 27. The diaries are moved through stations 2, 3, 5 and 6 by the opposed sets of grippers 14, Fig. 12, which grip a diary at one station, feed it to the next, and then return to the former station. Each gripper arm is pivoted on a split block 23 secured on a shaft 24 which is rocked and also reciprocated lengthwise of the machine in guides 39. The mechanisms may be operated by motor driven camshafts, or a series of hydraulic cylinder and ram assemblies. Feeding sheets.-Sheet-separators. The book covers 83, Fig. 13, are stacked on edge between side channels 56, Fig. 1, and are urged against a front stop-plate by a pair of intermittentlydriven belts 55 on which they rest. Each cover is separated by one or more telescopic sucker arms 80 pivoted at 81, each arm having a follower 86 urged against a cam 84 having a reduced section 87. The suckers 82 withdraw a cover 83 when the followers engage the section- 87, and both the arms 80 and the cam 84 are rotated together until the arms are vertical, whereupon the arms stop, the followers ride out of the section 87 to lower the cover on the table 29, and the cover is then released by the suckers. Feed tables; sheet forwarders. The feed table 29 is provided with two small holes 88 connected by pipes to a source of vacuum to retain the flat cover 83 in position 89, Fig. 1, and the cover is transferred to a second position 95 on the table which also has two suction holes 88: from this second position, the cover is carried by the pivoted oscillating gripper 27 and placed over a book filler. The means for moving the cover from position 89 to position 95 on the table 29 comprises guides 90, Fig. 13, at the side of the table slidably supporting a carrier arm 91 on which are suction heads 94, the arm 91 being pivotal about a shaft 92 to enable a cover to be picked up. Registering. As shown in the right hand half of Fig. 12, the book filler 65 has its. end papers raised to a horizontal position and supported by side plates 26 to receive a cover, which is in a flat condition. Pivoted jogger plates 70, Fig. 10, are swung by shafts 31 to register the book cover 71 fore and aft, and a cranked arm 72, secured to each jogger and adjustable relative thereto by a screw 74, registers the book filler 65. Side register of the cover and extended end papers is also effected by joggers. A phosphorbronze channel-shaped strip which engages each side edge of the end paper is carried by a block 42 slidable towards and away from the book, and a further block 44 on the block 42 carries an adjustable jogger 46 which engages the cover.",R D H THOMPSON & COMPANY LTD,THOMPSON JACK EVANS;;JOHNSON ARTHUR ERIC,,https://lens.org/081-414-625-502-624,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B42C11/04,B42C11/04,B8R RAC1          RAC1,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Electrolytic production of titanium tetrahalides. BRITISH TITAN PRODUCTS CO., Ltd. June 29, 1953 [July 16, 1952], No. 17971/52. Class 41. Titanium tetrahalide is prepared by electrolysis of a fused metal halide salt bath in which the anode comprises a mixture of titanium compounds, containing at least 90 per cent titanium dioxide, and carbon, the halogen liberated at the anode reacting with the titanium dioxide to form titanium tetrahalide. The fused salt may be potassium chloride, bromide, iodide or fluoride, sodium chloride, bromide, iodide or fluoride, calcium chloride or magnesium chloride, or a mixture of two or more of these, preferably having the same halogen radical. The electrolysis may be carried out in a bath heated to 700 to 1400 C., using a tantalum, graphite or iron cathode, or a liquid cathode of zinc or cadmium. The anode and cathode may be separated by a diaphragm, such as a porous pot, or by a non-porous barrier immersed below the electrolyte surface. The titanium compound may be a synthetic oxide or a natural oxide such as mineral rutile, mineral brookite, or mineral anatase, and may be mixed with charcoal or coal. The mixture may be contained in a porous pot with a carbon rod inserted therein, or the mixture may be bonded with gum, pitch or glue and a carbon rod inserted into the mass; the mixture may also be made into a paste with glycerine or dehydrated castor oil, shaped, dried and baked, with or without a carbon core, or the paste may be fed on the top surface of a decaying anode which is progressivelv lowered into the bath.

Hydraulic rotary absorption dynamometer. HEENAN & FROUDE Ltd. May 31, 1961 [June 1, 1960], No. 19465/60. Heading G1W. A dynamometer 1, particularly for testing brake-horsepower of an aero engine to which it is coupled, has a water inlet control 5 (coupled to the engine throttle) and an outlet 2 the back pressure on which is variable, so as to vary the braking torque, by movement of a valve member 8 carried on a spindle 9. The latter is formed with a piston, 11, sliding in a cylinder 10. Oil is supplied on one side of the piston, through a pipe 39 from a constant speed pump 37 driven independently by an electric motor 80, at a fixed ""reference pressure"", and on the other side through a pipe 32 from a pump 30 driven by the dynamometer. Thus, movement of the piston, and hence valve member 8, towards the left, will only occur for high engine speeds giving sufficient pressure in pump 30 to overcome the reference pressure. Once this speed has been reached, movement of the valve member 8 causes large increases of back pressure in the outlet 2 for small speed increments, as indicated by the curve ofe in Fig. 36 showing the brake horsepower developed as a function of engine speed. The characteristic of the dynamometer is adjusted by means of coarse and fine needle valves, 40 and 41, arranged in parallel in pipe 34 which communicates, via cylinder 10, with pipe 32, and a needle valve 51 in the reference pressure circuit. These valves may be remotely controlled by means of motors 42, 43, 52. Relief valves are indicated by 48 and 57. Oil for the pumps is obtained from a steadytemperature tank 29. This is positioned to supply a low-pressure fluid head directly to a fluid dashpot 104 for a piston 100 of the spindle 9. Bellows 12 on spindle 9 prevent oil leakage. To simulate different flight conditions, when a variable pitch propeller is to be used, the ""coarse pitch"" and ""fine pitch"" oil outlets of the hydraulic propeller control unit of the engine are connected, respectively, to cylinders 27 and 27a of a differentialpressure ram unit 22 (see Figs. 1 and 2) coupled via a lever 18 to the spindle 9. Movement of the valve member 8 will thus be influenced additionally by adjustment of the propeller control unit, or only by the latter if the needle valves 40, 41 and 51 are adjusted to ""zero"" resistance.",HEENAN & FROUDE LTD,EVANS GODFREY ARTHUR;;JARVIS IVOR MAURICE,,https://lens.org/159-139-384-781-70X,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,G01L3/20,G01L3/20,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

[Also in Group XXXV] Apparatus for detecting flaws in a ferromagnetic cylinder 1, Figs. 1 and 2, comprises a magnet 4, 5, 6 supported in a carriage 12, 13 which is supported by wheels 8, 9, 10, 11 set at an angle so that as the cylinder is rotated, the magnet moves longitudinally of the cylinder; the cylinder is thus magnetically scanned and variations in the local field are detected by any suitable means. In one mode, a tray 14 contains a fluid having a suspension of magnetic powder, so that the cylinder passes through the fluid and the magnetic powder collects along the line of cracks or flaws.

Metal halides prepared electrolytically. BRITISH TITAN PRODUCTS CO. Ltd. Oct. 31, 1958 [Nov. 27, 1957], No. 37034/57. Class 41. In a process for making halides of tetravalent metals and silicon electrolytically, in which the electrolyte consists of molten alkali metal or alkaline earth metal halide, the anode consists of carbon mixed with the oxide of silica or the metal with which halogen formed at the anode combines to form the tetra halide. The process applies particularly to silica used in the form of quartz, tridymite or siliceous material, e.g. zircon silicates, or bauxite, but zircon dioxide as baddelyite is also specified. This may be finely ground with petroleum coke or charcoal, a binder, e.g. gum, pitch, glycerine or de, hydrated castor oil, compressed to form a rod which is then fired. Alternatively the powdered siliceous material is filled into a porous pot with a carbon rod inserted therein. In a suitable apparatus, molten MgCl 2 , 2, is contained in a vessel 1 provided with a carbon or tungsten cathode 5, and a carbon rod anode 21 immersed in a mixture of carbon and silica 8 surrounded by a silica tube 9. The electrolyte is maintained at 700‹ to 1400‹ C. using a thermocouple 4, and an inert gas fed into a tube 13 carries off the SiCl 4 produced to an outlet 14. Magnesium metal is deposited on the cathode, and forms a pool under the molten MgCl 2 . As the anode is consumed, additions are made of a pasty mixture of carbon, siliceous material and binder, which is baked in the cell. The anode mixture contains about 30% of carbon. Other electrolytes used are CaCl 2 , NaCl and KCl mixture, LiCl, and BeCl 2 .

PRESS GUARDS, Ltd. March 16, 1956 [March 16, 1955], No. 7625/55. Class 80 (4). In a mechanical or fluid-pressure press, or other machine, which is caused to make a single operative stroke by the automatic actuation of a clutch, valve or other means when a poweroperated guard completes its closing movement, a control mechanism is provided whereby the guard-closing means is energized automatically at regular and predetermined time intervals. In the control mechanism shown in Fig. 1 the guard (not shown) is closed by an air cylinder (not shown) connected through a pipe line G to an air supply union 26 through a valve 25 which is opened by a cam 34 on a crosshead 17 reciprocable on rods 18. The crosshead 17 is actuated by a piston in a cylinder 10 whose opposite ends are alternately supplied with air by a reversing valve 22. The valve 22 is actuated by air pressure through a reducing connector 27 and pilot valves 20, 21 which are alternately opened by pegs 19 on the crosshead 17. The crosshead 17 is coupled to a piston in an oil cylinder 13 connected to an oil reservoir 16 through one-way restrictor valves 14 adjustment of which varies the speed of the crosshead 17 and so varies the time interval between successive actuations of the guard-opening valve 25. The cam 23 is of wedge shape and is transversely adjustable to vary the period during which the valve 25 is held open. The valves 20, 21 may be replaced by limit switches controlling a solenoid or solenoids actuating the valve 22. Alternatively the valves 20, 21 may be replaced by a single double-acting valve, which may be operated through a throw-over spring toggle device. The guard may be locked in the closed position by a lever coacting with a cam on the press crankshaft, the lock being released as the crankshaft passes bottom dead-centre, or as it reaches top dead-centre. The control mechanism is mounted on a bracket 28 for fitting to an existing press, and may control a number of presses. In modifications, a guard-closing air valve is intermittently opened by a cam driven through hydraulic or other variable speed gear by an electric motor, or by a press flywheel. In the control mechanism shown in Fig. 5, an air supply pipe 40 is connected through a guardclosing valve 42 and emergency stop valve 52 to a guard-closing cylinder (not shown), and is also connected through a reducing valve 44 to a valve 45 actuated by a cam on a press crankshaft, or a cam on the press slide. In the top dead-centre position shown the valve 45 is closed and air is supplied through valve 42 to close the guard and start the press. As the crankshaft rotates the valve 45 is opened to admit air to the upper end of a cylinder 49 whose piston 50 is thus depressed and closes valve 42, oil below the piston 50 being moved freely past a one-way restrictor 51 into a reservoir 41. At the completion of a press stroke the valve 45 is closed and air pressure in the oil reservoir 41 slowly raises the piston 50 to reopen valve 42 and start another cycle after a time interval determined by the adjustable oneway restrictor 51. In a modification a guardclosing valve 61, Fig. 6, supplying air to a guardclosing cylinder through an emergency stop valve 62, is opened by a head 63 on the rod of a piston 64 in a cylinder 65 whose lower end is connected to the air supply and whose upper end is connected to an oil reservoir 67 through a one-way adjustable restrictor 66 restricting oil flow towards the reservoir. The head 63 is engaged by a fork on a bracket 68 adjustably mounted on a press-slide, shown at top deadcentre. When the air supply is turned on, air flows through valve 61 to close the guard, whereupon the press starts and the bracket 68 moves the head 63 to allow the valve 61 to close. When the press slide and the bracket 68 return to their uppermost positions, the head 63 is left behind but is slowly raised by the air pressure acting on piston 64, the rate of return being controlled by the restrictor 66, which thus determines the time interval before the head 63 reopens the valve 61 to start another cycle. Instead of being actuated by the bracket 68, the head 63 may be moved by mechanism actuated by the press crankshaft.",PRESS GUARDS LTD,BAGG ALBERT EDWARD;;EVANS FREDERICK ARTHUR,,https://lens.org/106-732-445-122-201,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,F16P3/04,F16P3/04,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Backplate-mounted means to retain the door open has a spring-biased arm (34, Fig. 2) movable downwards against spring (42) bias until a linkage part (51) on a catchplate (47) passes over, whereupon the arm rises so that a surface (38, Figs. 2 and 6) of the arm holds the linkage and door open. In manually shutting the door, the arm (34) is thrust down by the linkage part (51) so that the closer operates. To automatically shut the door, where fire is detected, an electromagnet is released to allow an arm (19) to pivot under spring bias and thus allow the spring-biased arm (34) to move axially and release the door. If the catch plate (47, Fig. 6) is free of the main arm (45) the door is free-swinging once it is moved to an open position. Accordingly simple fixing means (49, 50) are used so that conversion from a free-swinging door to a held open door or vice versa can easily be carried out. In the event of a fire however, the door is automatically closed by the released catchplate, regardless of whether it is in a free-swinging or held open state. <IMAGE>",NEWMAN TONKS ENG,EVANS DAVID HOWARD;;BISHOP ARTHUR EDGAR,,https://lens.org/127-205-950-058-754,Patent Application,no,0,5,3,8,0,E05F3/222;;E05F15/72;;E05Y2900/132,E05F3/22;;E05F15/20,E2A ABA           ABA;;E2A ACME          ACME;;E2A A106          ABA;;E2A A106          ACME;;E2A A136          ABA;;E2A A136          ACME;;E2A A163          ABA;;E2A A163          ACME;;E2A A500          ABA;;E2A A500          ACME;;E2A A504          ABA;;E2A A504          ACME;;E2A A505          ABA;;E2A A505          ACME;;E2A A508          ABA;;E2A A508          ACME;;E2A A555          ABA;;E2A A555          ACME;;E2M MAX5          M11F2;;E2M M11F2         M11F2;;E2M M12A          M11F2;;E2M M16           M11F2;;E2M M25           M11F2,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

HEENAN & FROUDE Ltd. May 2, 1958 [May 9, 1957], No. 14833/57. Class 106 (2). [Also in Groups XXIX and XXXIV] An hydraulic absorption dynamometer 1 is provided with a back-pressure valve 2 and means 13 responsive to the dynamometer speed for controlling the actuation of the valve 2 so that up to a selected predetermined speed the valve causes variable back pressure such that the power absorbed by the dynamometer varies with the cube of the speed and, upon the speed of the dynamometer exceeding that predetermined speed, the back pressure builds up rapidly so as to maintain the speed of the dynamometer substantially constant. The back pressure valve is shown in Fig. 2 and consists of a double mushroom valve a acting to open or close the water outlet 34 from the dynamometer casing 1. The valve a is mounted on a spindle b carrying a piston d, high-pressure oil from a pump 7, driven at a speed proportional to the speed of the dynamometer, being supplied to the left side of the piston through an inlet pipe 18, and low-pressure oil being supplied to the right side of the piston through an inlet 28. A spring n loads the spindle to the left to hold the valve a off its seatings under low load conditions. The speed-responsive means 13 is shown in Fig. 5 and consists of a piston c 6 loaded to the left by two adjustable tension springs h 6 . High-pressure oil from a pump 6 similar to the pump 7 is supplied to the left of the piston c 6 through an inlet 12, and the low-pressure oil being supplied to the backpressure valve 2 passes to the right of the piston c 6 between pipes 27 and 28, this path being cut-off if the piston c 6 moves to the right. Needle valves 15, 20 (Fig. 1), set by electric motors 21, 22, control the pressure of the oil in pipes 14, 19, upstream of these valves. The operation is as follows: If the speed is below the predetermined value, the pump 7 delivers oil through a filter 17 to the back-pressure valve 2 and by pressing its piston d to the right restricts the outflow of water through the outlet 34. For any one setting of the valve 20, the pressure set up behind the piston d will ensure that the back pressure against the water flowing through the outlet 34 will vary as the square of the speed, and hence the power absorbed will vary as the cube of the speed. Adjustment of the valve 20 regulates the factor of proportionality. Under these conditions, oil is supplied by the pump 6 through the valve 13 and the valve 15, which latter is partly closed, to the oil storage tank 3. When the speed of the dynamometer reaches the predetermined speed, the pressure to the left of the piston c 6 of the valve 13 rises sufficiently to move the piston over to the right, thus stopping the flow of oil through the pipes 27, 28 and this, overriding the action of the valve 20, causes an increase in pressure in the pipe 19. This in turn causes a sudden rise in the pressure applied to the piston d and hence a steep rise in the power absorbed. The speed at which this occurs is controlled by the adjustment of the springs h 6 and of the valve 15. If the tension in the springs h 6 is low, the valve 15 need only be closed slightly and the rate of movement of the piston c 6 is relatively low. If the tension in the springs h 6 is high, the valve 15 is closed further and the rate of movement of the piston c 6 is higher, thus ensuring that the speed stays more nearly constant as the power absorbed rises. In addition, a valve 23 controlling the rate of influx of water to the dynamometer is opened further by the rise of oil pressure in a pipe 26 caused by the closing of pipe 27. The Provisional Specification describes two further embodiments, in each of which the change from the cube law to constant speed absorption law is made manually, the apparatus operating to give substantially no power absorption up to a predetermined speed and then to operate on either of the above laws.

Mules.-The object is to attach broken ends automatically to the spindles when the carriage approaches the roller beam. The loose ends hanging from the rollers fall into the notches of a plate I beneath, which, as the carriage completes its inward run, is moved horizontally close to the spindles, and is caused to follow them for a few inches on their outward run. The plate is carried by a frame G, which slides on rollers J and is connected to a weighted shaft E, so that, when the shaft is free, the plate I follows the spindles. The parts are shown in the position when the carriage has just completed its inward run. A bracket K on the carriage has passed the pivoted catch U on the lever M secured to the cam disc N on the shaft E without operating it, and the cam disc N, which, during the greater part of the outward and inward run, was blocked by the catch in the position shown by the catch 0, has been released by the pivoted stop P on the carriage. By the action of the weight T, the plate I is now pressed against the spindles and caused to follow them for a short distance on their outward run, until the bracket K engages with the catch U and moves the parts again into the position shown, in which they are blocked by the catch 0 until the carriage completes another inward run. A modification is shown in Fig. 1 (Sheet 2), in which the plate I is held in its most backward position by a weight Z, which is heavier than the weight T, is carried on the end of the lever Z', and is raised as the carriage completes its inward run by reason of the carriage moving an inclined slide beneath a roller Y on the lever.",EVANS GERALD ARTHUR;;MEREDITH JOHN EDWARD,EVANS GERALD ARTHUR;;MEREDITH JOHN EDWARD,,https://lens.org/193-380-103-974-032,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Manual closure is also possible with a door in the held open state by overcoming the hold-open force. <IMAGE>",NEWMAN TONKS ENG,EVANS DAVID HOWARD;;BISHOP ARTHUR EDGAR,,https://lens.org/150-557-730-152-397,Patent Application,no,0,1,3,8,0,E05F3/222;;E05F15/72;;E05Y2900/132,E05F3/22;;E05F15/20,E2M MAX5          M11F2;;E2M M11F2         M11F2;;E2M M12A          M11F2;;E2M M16           M11F2;;E2M M25           M11F2,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The fluidized bed and/or the gaseous products of the chlorination may be cooled by a suitable liquid or solid cooling agent or a suspension of the latter in the former, specifically mentioned agents being ferric chloride and titanium tetrachloride. In the example, titanium tetrachloride was used to control the bed temperature at 970 DEG C. or below; ferric chloride was admitted to a first condenser to cool the gases to 300 DEG C.; an atomized spray of titanium tetrachloride cooled residual gases to 130 DEG C. and precipitated ferric chloride; and a series of tube condensers cooled the remaining gases to below -10 DEG C. to remove titanium tetrachloride; chlorine comprised less than 1 per cent of the original gaseous mixture.

The K, Rb or Cs source may be added batchwise to the bed, giving a concentration by weight (estimated as oxide) with respect to the weight of the bed of 0.1-5%; or continuously, with concentration with respect to TiO2 produced of 2%; if 0.1-1% of a source of Na, Li or Group IIa or IIb elements be added to the bed, only 0.01-0.05% K, Rb or Cs is required. The sources of the elements may be salts, hydroxides or the elemental metals, e.g. as vapour. The source may be introduced, e.g. with a reactant, as a solid or liquid or a solution; the bed particles may be slurried with source solution and dried before use; or the source may itself form all or part of the bed particles, e.g. as potassium aluminium silicate. The titanium tetrahalide, e.g. TiCl4, may be introduced as a vapour; the oxygenating gas may be O2 with or without inert gas, e.g. as air; other gases, e.g. N2, may also be introduced. The bed temperature is 800 DEG -1200 DEG C. Additional heat may or may not be supplied, e.g. electrical heating, preheating one or more input gases, or burning a fuel, e.g. CO, in the bed with additional oxygenating gas. Bed particles, e.g. SiO2, ZrSiO4, Al2,O3 or TiO2, have size 50-2,000 m . Minor proportions of rutilizing agents, e.g. aluminium halide, zirconium tetrahalide, water vapour, or other TiO2 crystal-modifying agents, e.g. halides of Si, Sb and P, may be added. The TiO2 may be recovered from the effluent gas by use of a cyclone to remove larger particles and filtration to recover pigmentary TiO2. The gaseous halogen product may be separated by liquefaction and used to produce more titanium tetrahalide. In examples the pigmentary TiO2 recovered had rutile content of about 98%; after wet milling the bed material up to about 13% of the trahalide admitted was retained thereon as TiO2; in a contrasting run in which the source was omitted, 40% tetrahalide was retained.

C. H., and Evans, A. B. Nov. 11. Lithographic and like printing; feeding sheets.- A machine for printing on tin plates and the like has a roller c, Fig. 1, carrying an aluminium or similar printing-surface, suitably damped and inked in the usual manner, and transferring the design to a cylinder b having a rubber or like surface, from which the design is pressed on to the tin plate, carried round between the gripper and impression cylinder a and the printing cylinder b. The shaft b<1> of the cylinder b runs in eccentric bearings q, and the cylinder may be moved out of contact with the cylinders c, a, when desired, during the printing operation by pressing the pedal v. This action depresses the tumbler u, and allows the link s, reciprocated by the cam t<1>, roller t, and lever s<1> to pull over the lever r<1> during the printing operation, and thereby, through the lever r, an adjustable link, and the lever q<1>, partly turns the eccentric bushes q on each side of the machine and moves the cylinder b oat of action. When the pedal v rises through the action of a spring, the hook at the end of the link s no longer engages the pin r', and the cylinder b remains in working position. The sheets of tin are fed by hand, one by one, from a table f to a vertical steel face-plate g, Figs. 1 and 2, supported on a feed-board g<1> mounted on brackets g<2>. The lower edge passes between springs i adjustably mounted on a guidebar i<1> and smoothers k on the shaft k<1>, and finally rests on the tips of the arms h mounted on a shaft h<1>. The sheet is then gripped by the grippers e, and at the same time a cam m on the cylinder a, lowers the arms h through a roller n on a lever n<1> engaging a roller o on a lever o<1> on the shaft h<1>, and also moves backwards the smoothers k through the extra links and levers h<2>, k<2>. The sheet being vertical, its own weight helps to overcome its inertia, and it passes down between the guides l and the cylinder a, is printed on by the cylinder b, and pulled past the guides l<1>, Fig. 1, the hindmost edge springing outwards immediately it has passed the guides l<1>. At the same time the grippers e are turned backwards to release the front edge of the sheet, which falls printed side uppermost on the table l'. The grippers are opened by a pin p<1>, Fig. 2, mounted on an arm adjustable in position, engaging with a slot in a piece d<1> on the end of the gripper shaft, the grippers being turned backwards through nearly 180‹ in the slot a<1>, and are closed on the sheet by a similar pin p fixed to the framework, entering and leaving the other end of the slot in the piece d<1>, thereby turning the grippers forward.",WICHMANN GEORG CARL HEINRICH;;EVANS ARTHUR BURROUGHES,WICHMANN GEORG CARL HEINRICH;;EVANS ARTHUR BURROUGHES,,https://lens.org/030-934-177-265-213,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The reactants are separately introduced through inlet ducts in a perforated base of the fluidized bed, the perforations being provided with inserts forming constrictions such that the pressure drop thereacross is at least one half of the pressure drop from the bottom to top of the fluidized bed. The bed is of sufficient size to act as a heat reservoir to avoid the necessity of supplying extra heat. It is desirable however to preheat the oxygen to avoid condensation of the silicon tetrachloride vapour. The velocity of the fluidizing gas is preferably between 2 and 50 times the minimum required for fluidization and the pressure drop across the constrictions will generally be more than 2 p.s.i. Excess reaction heat may be withdrawn by conventional coolers or by the employment of gaseous coolants such as chlorine, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or cooled recycled tail gases or by liquid chlorine injected into or sprayed upon the bed; additional cooling may be effected by progressively introducing relatively cool sand or other inert material to the bed whilst discharging hot material thereby maintaining the temperature from 500 DEG -1300 DEG C. and more particularly at about 1000 DEG C. The silica reaction product, separated from the gases by means of cyclones may be freed from adsorbed or combined chlorine by heating to 300 DEG -600 DEG C. by passing air countercurrent to the silica reaction product in a rotary tube or by fluidizing the hot reaction product with cold gas. If oxygen is employed for this purpose it may then be fed as a pre-heated reactant to the main oxidation process. The after-treatment gas may also contain ammonia or water vapour to assist in the removal or neutralization of the adsorbed chlorine in the silicon dioxide product. The silicon chloride and oxygen reactants are generally employed in stoichiometric amounts but the oxygen tetrachloride ratio may vary from 1:1 to 5:1 on a molar basis. Moisture is preferably, but not necessarily, avoided. The apparatus employed may be that described and claimed in Specification 919,020. Thus, as shown in Fig. 1, a heat insulated reaction chamber is provided with a perforated base having inlets 112 connected to a manifold 26 for the supply of silicon tetrachloride and inlets 212 and 312 for oxygen connected to manifold 25. Each inlet is provided with a constriction plate 43 which produces the requisite pressure drop. Reaction products are withdrawn through line 126 and cool sand is fed from a fluidized bed 73 through pipe 70 to the main reaction bed whilst excess sand is withdrawn through a line 77 to a bed fluidized with air fed through line 85 and leaving through a pipe 84. The sand is finally withdrawn through line 83. An alternative base plate construction is shown in Fig. 5, where separate wind boxes 404 and 405 are fed with oxygen and the tetrachloride respectively through lines 406 and 407. The fluidized bed is supported on a perforated refractory base plate 11 having ceramic inserts 400 provided with downwardly directed outlets 410. The lower end of the ceramic inserts are provided with screw plugs 402 having pressure reducing orifices 403. Silica reaction product entrained in the gases leaving through line 126 (Fig. 1) are first separated in a cyclone separator from the chlorine-containing reacted gases, and then treated to remove undesired acidity for example by feeding to a fluidized bed where they are treated with air or oxygen, containing ammonia with or without water vapour, whereby the pH of the product is above 3,5. According to a typical example, silica sand of average diameter 250 microns constituted the main reaction bed to which oxygen was fed together with silicon tetrachloride through a steam jacketed vaporizing tube. The tetrachloride oxygen molar ratio was 1-1,5. The reaction temperature was maintained at 1000 DEG -1050 DEG C. by continuous slow replacement of the silica which was heated to 400 DEG C. in the fluidized bed 71 before passage to the main reactor.

The bed may be made up of particles of silica, alumina, zircon or rutile and the reaction chamber preferably has a perforated base below which air or oxygen is fed. Additional oxygen may be fed in admixture with the titanium tetrahalide feed, which may pass through a part of the perforated base or be fed from a point above the base. Alternatively titanium tetrahalide may be fed from the side or the top of the reaction chamber, and injected as gas or liquid into the bed just above the base through tube jets; part of the tetrahalide feed may be in liquid form from the top of the bed. Titanium tetrachloride is usually employed but the tetrabromide or tetraiodide may be used. The reaction is generally self-sustaining, but fuel gases such as carbon monoxide may be admixed with the tetrachloride reactant. The temperature in the bed is normally from 700 DEG -1200 DEG C. whilst the temperature above the bed is slightly higher. Molar ratios of tetrachloride to oxygen may be from 1-0,2 to 1-3. According to an example a vertical shaft reaction chamber containing zircon sand was fed with titanium tetrachloride vapour through four central inlets from a common manifold, and oxygen through eight inlets on both sides of the tetrachloride ports. The bed was preheated to 970 DEG C. and on reaction fell to 930 DEG C. whilst the temperature above the bed was about 990 DEG C.

The particles, of diameter range 74-1800 m , may be of TiO2, and may contain 1% KCl, and a bed thereof may be fluidized or in the form of a heat-exchanging fountain circulating between two stages. An inert gas may be added to assist fluidization. The reaction temperature of 900-1200 DEG C. may be maintained autothermally; alternatively an external source of heat may additionally be used, e.g. by burning a fuel, e.g. oil, C, CO, or by electrical heating. The proportion of Zr tetrahalide is 0.5-7% by weight of Ti tetrahalide, calculated as the oxides or a proportion of Zr tetrahalide such that up to 25% of the weight of the final product is ZrO2. The halides are preferably the chlorides. The oxygenating gas may be oxygen with or without an inert gas, e.g. as air. Other substances may be added to the bed, e.g. 0.1-10% Al trihalide, 0.01-1% Si tetrahalide, 0.01-1% water, or a source of K, Rb or Cs. The halides of Ti and Zr may be preheated to form vapour and the vapours led into the reaction zone mixed or separately; if the Zr halide and oxygenating gas are introduced together, they should be preheated to below reaction temperature, e.g. up to 300 DEG C. In a fluidized bed, about 60-80% TiO2 formed will be entrained in the effluent gases, and is mainly rutile. The residual TiO2 mainly forms an aceretion on the bed particles; excess bed material is removed continuously or at intervals and may be ground, wet or dry, in mills with e.g. at least one surface of polyurethane rubber. The particulate matter and ground-off TiO2 particles may be classified by gas or liquid separation; the particles are returned to the reaction zone; the ground-off TiO2 may be used, e.g. in vitreous enamels. In examples, up to 72% of TiO2 produced was entrained, up to 99% was in rutile form, tinting strength was up to 1680 (Reynolds scale) and mean crystal size was down to 0.15 m .

Preferably the aluminium halide is introduced in admixture with all or part of the oxygen-containing gas required for the reaction; in the latter case it is preferred that the oxygen-containing gas introduced with the aluminium halide is at least five times the amount required to oxidize the aluminium halide. Any oxygen-containing gas not introduced with the aluminium halide is introduced either alone or with the titanium tetrahalide. In the illustrated embodiment the apparatus comprises a fused silica tube 1 containing a bed 5 surrounded by a furnace 8 and sealed at its base with a silica disc 2 through which pass inlets 3 and 4. Aluminium trichloride and oxygen are supplied to inlet 3, the oxygen <PICT:0986660/C1/1> being supplied from pipe 9 and the aluminium trichloride being provided by passing chlorine from pipe 11 through heated reactor tube 12 containing aluminium turnings. Titanium tetrachloride in admixture with silicon tetrachloride is introduced at inlet 4, the feed being introduced as a liquid to pipe 14 and vaporized in 15. Alternatively the silicon tetrachloride can be introduced by pipe 18 either alone or with a carrier gas such as chlorine. The bed 5, of dense TiO2 particles (-44 + 72 BSS), is initially fluidized with air until external heating by means of furnace 8 has raised it to 900 DEG -1200 DEG C. The process may be carried out in the presence of a small proportion of moisture e.g. less than 2% by weight of the titanium tetrahalide. During the process 60 to 80% of the TiO2 formed is entrained, mainly in rutile form, in the affluent gases and carried away from the reaction chamber. The remainder of the TiO2 forms loosely bound accretions on the particles constituting the bed thus causing the bed to increase in volume. The excess bed, or the whole bed, is removed and subjected to attrition, using wet or dry milling processes, to remove the loosely bound particles from the substrate and to separate them from one another, and the substrate material may then be returned to the bed. The amount of aluminium and silicon halides introduced is preferably such that the weights of each of the alumina and silica in the final TiO2 pigment will be 0.1 to 7% and the relative proportions of the two halides introduced is normally such as to produce a weight ratio of alumina to silica in the final pigment of 20:1 to 1:5.

The heated gas may be in the form of a plasma and may be e.g. argon, oxygen or free-oxygen containing gas such as air, nitrogen, helium, neon, krypton, carbon dioxide or oxides of nitrogen. a minor proportion of a gas which has a high thermal conductivity, e.g. hydrogen, may be included. The heating may be in the form of an arc between electrodes preferably arranged as a central electrode and an annular electrode both of which may be cooled by means of a circulating liquid coolant. The current may be direct or alternating. Induction heating may be employed by passing the gas through a space surrounded by a confining tube of e.g. silica and around which is wound electrically conducting material, e.g. copper tubing carrying an alternating current of, say, 200 kilocycles to 10 megacycles. A gaseous or liquid coolant, e.g. water, may be passed through the coil. The gas may be in helical or laminar flow or a mixture of both. The first and last turns of the coil may be in a direction opposite to that of the remainder. The particles of titaniferous material may be of 30-100 microns and may be added to the gas stream as described in Specification 1,093,442. The condensed material may be subjected to a magnetic or electric field. A rutilizing agent, e.g. an aluminium halide or zirconium tetrachloride may be added before vaporization and other <PICT:1093441/C1/1> modifying agents, e.g. compounds of silicon or boron such as the halides, or lower halides of titanium, water or alkali metal ions may be added before or after vaporization. An apparatus as shown comprises two silica tubes (1) and (2), around (1) are wound coils of copper tubing (3) connected to a radio-frequency generator. A silica tube (4) provides an annular space (5) through which gas may be passed. Silica tube 6 with orifice (7) is attached to a supply of particulate material and feed gas.

Jan. 24 1969 [Jan. 26, 1968; Nov. 19, 1968], Nos.4232/68 and 54879/68. Heading G1V. A current measuring system for use with large currents on a high voltage conductor incorporates a search unit incorporating a secondary winding on a magnetic core surrounding the conductor which provides an output which is used to energize the magnetizing coils of two or more Faraday effect devices. The actions of all the Faraday devices on a plane polarized light beam are combined to provide a beam whose polarization rotation represents the current to be measured. In one arrangement Fig. 1 the search unit incorporates a single winding 3 on a core 2 surrounding the conductor 1 and the output of this energizes two differently dimensioned magnetizing coils 6, 7 for two Faraday effect bodies 8, 9 through which a plan polarized infrared beam from a source S is passed. The plane polarized beam is additively rotated by each of the coils 6, 7. This system provides automatic range changing, the system being particularly sensitive to small currents because of the strong magnetic excitation per ampere turn due to coil 6. When the saturation level of the element associated with this is reached however it makes no further contribution to beam rotation and the system responds in a less sensitive manner to larger currents, further rotation being produced only by the coil 7. Alternatively two separate, differently sized coils may be arranged on the core 2, each supplying similarly sized coils 6, 7 Fig. 2 (not shown). The rotations may be subtractive, the currents in the windings 6, 7 rotating the beam in opposite directions so that there is no resultant rotation until one of the elements saturates, whereafter the other causes an output to be produced. In this way the system will respond only to currents to be measured in excess of a threshold. A similar technique may be used for temperature compensation. Faraday materials with different temperature co-efficients are used so chosen that when their effects on the plane polarized beam are subtractive temperature compensation is effected. Where all the elements are the same, and their effects are added, a system of improved sensitivity results. In a system for reducing interference due to near-by conductors or steady fields on a Faraday device, two such devices are arranged side by side and an optical mirror system is arranged to reflect a plan polarized beam transmitted through one of then back in the opposite direction through the other. The magnetizing coils are wound so as to rotate the beam additively as it passes each device. Interfering fields will however produce a subtractive, cancelling effect in the two coils, Fig. 6. All the arrangements previously described may be used in this system, by associating a further Faraday device with each of the two main devices. These further devices may have their windings in series with those of the main devices or may be energized from a separate winding on the core 2.

By making the retroviral sequences of the construct deficient in coat protein-encoding sequences, the construct is by itself incapable of packaging its genome as a retrovirion. The promoter sequence may be a viral LTR sequence. Alternatively the promoter sequence may be a nonviral promoter linked to the cDNA sequence, promoting the cDNA irrespective of cellular mechanisms which affect viral sequence expression. The retroviral genomes corresponding to the constructs are rescued as complete packaged virions by helper virus vectors which encode the coat proteins that are needed to package the genomes corresponding to the constructs. Helper virus vectors that are deficient in packaging sequences do not package their own genomes, and cells incorporating such a deficient helper virus vector and also a construct shed only retrovirions that are infectious a single time. Helper viral vectors which produce amphotropic proteins package recombinant retrovirions that are infective of cells of a variety of species. Cells infected with recombinant retrovirions are transplantable into an animal to comprise a portion of the somatic cells of the animal and express recombinant gene product therein.

En rendant les séquences retrovirales de la construction insuffisantes en séquences de codage de protéines de revêtement, la construction devient incapable d'envelopper elle-même son genome comme un retrovirion.

Specified monomers are vinyl acetate, alkyl acrylates, methacrylates, maleates and fumarates, acrylonitrile, vinylidene chloride, styrene and butadiene. The pigment may be titanium dioxide, e.g. a rutile pigment coated with alumina, titanium dioxide or silica. Specified surface-active agents are octadecylamine acetate and the octadecyl ester of carboxymethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride. Dispersion stabilizers, e.g. linseed oil modified pentaerythritol containing alkyd resins, may be present, and the polymerization may be effected in the presence of conventional redox catalyst systems, emulsifying agents and protective colloids, e.g. methyl, ethyl, hydroxymethyl or hydroxyethyl cellulose, and plasticizers, e.g. dibutyl phthalate. The products may be used in the preparation of coating compositions. In an example, vinyl acetate containing a linseed oil modified pentaerythritol containing alkyd resin is added to an aqueous dispersion of alumina/titania coated rutile pigment and octadecylamine acetate. Hydroxyethyl cellulose, polyethylene oxide, trisodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate and sodium bicarbonate are added, and the vinyl acetate is polymerized in the presence of ammonium persulphate, sodium metabisulphite and benzoyl peroxide.ALSO:Substrates may be coated with pigmented polymer compositions prepared by mixing a solid particulate pigment, water, a surfact active agent and a water-insoluble polymerizable monomer, the pigment being initially in the aqueous phase and the surface active agent being such that it causes transfer of the pigment into the monomer, and thereafter polymerizing the pigment containing monomer.

The oil pipe crosses a hot gas zone to a manifold on the engine inner casing so that an oil leak is a potential fire hazard. The connection into the bearing chamber manifold includes a secondary containment system that ensures that any leakage from the oil pipe seal is contained within an interstitial space between the pipe and a co-axial, secondary containment member. The interstitial space opens into a relatively safe zone outside the outer engine casing where the fire or safety hazard is eliminated or does not exist.

Also described are compositions that include the tungstate compounds, and a method for reducing the positive thermal expansion of a material using such tungstate compounds. Substantially single phase compounds can be made by practicing the method, which method also reduces the synthesis time relative to known methods, and expands the reactants that can be used for the synthesis over the methods reported previously. The tungstate compounds generally can be made by forming a solution, particularly an aqueous solution, comprising a W.sup.6+ compound and a second metal compound wherein the metal is selected from the group consisting of Zr.sup.4+, Hf.sup.4+ and combinations thereof. The solvent is removed from the solution by any known method to leave the solutes as a solid product. The solid product is then heated to a temperature of greater than about 600.degree. C., preferably at least about 1165.degree. C., more preferably from about 1165.degree. C. to about 1250.degree. C., and even more preferably to about 1200.degree. C.

The oil pipe crosses a hot gas zone to a manifold on the engine inner casing so that an oil leak is a potential fire hazard. The connection into the bearing chamber manifold includes a secondary containment system that ensures that any leakage from the oil pipe seal is contained within an interstitial space between the pipe and a co-axial, secondary containment member. The interstitial space opens into a relatively safe zone outside the outer engine casing where the fire or safety hazard is eliminated or does not exist.

A stacked indicator for the selective showing of any one of a set of numbers or letters &c. comprises a stack of plates arranged with their adjacent faces substantially in contact, a totally internally-reflecting light transmitting passage arranged at the rear of each one of the plates and a distinctive source of light associated with each passage to provide for trans-illumination of the plates and of the symbols on them. Fig. 1 of the Provisional Specification 2215/58 shows an indicator comprising stacked plates 1, for example of "" Perspex "" (Registered Trade Mark), which are bent to provide portions 2 substantially at right-angles to the plane of the operative portions of the plate on which the symbols, for example letters or numbers, are engraved. A festoon lamp 3 is associated with each of the plates so that they may be selectively illuminated total internal reflection of the light being provided at the bend in the plate. In the modification shown in Fig. 2, of the Provisional Specification 2215/58, the perspex plates 1 are stacked and bent so that their end portions 2 are mounted in slots in a block 5 of opaque material each being associated with a pea lamp 6 housed in bores in the block. As shown in Fig. 3 of the Provisional Specification 2215/58, the slots 4 are such that the portions 2 of the plate do not reach the end of their slot and the lamp 6 penetrate into it a short distance. The edge of the plate remote from the lamp 6 may be cut at an angle, polished and coated with reflective material to provide for transverse internal reflection at this face to direct the light at other angles into the engraving which forms the symbol on the face of the plate. The symbol on the plate may be in the form of discrete dots or the like separated by a distance small compared with the diameter of the dots. As shown in the Figure of the Provisional Specification 24276/58, a solid block 20 of Perspex or similar transparent material illuminated by a lamp 17 has one edge in contact with one Perspex plate of a stacked indicator, the block and the edge of the plates 11 may be coated with an opaque or silver finish to ensure total internal reflection.",K G M ELECTRONICS LTD,EVANS MEURIG HILL;;ELSEY ROBIN ARTHUR WARREN;;FREEDMAN HAROLD PHILIP,,https://lens.org/140-380-138-497-018,Granted Patent,no,0,5,1,1,0,G09F9/46,G09F9/46,G5C CEK           CEK,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The bed conditions are such that the iron sulphate is retained therein for sufficient time for substantially complete decomposition. The bed is preferably 3-5 feet deep, and may comprise magnetite, pyrites cinder, silica, nitile, or zircon. The fuel may be introduced either mixed with or separately from the iron sulphate, and preferably at a number of distributed points below the bed surface. Fuels which may be employed include coke, charcoal, anthracite, bitumen, pitch, fuel oil, tar, creosotepitch, hydrocarbons, producer gas, pyrites, pyrrotite, native sulphur, or mixtures of the above. The preferred fuel is powdered coal, preferably of particle size below 10 BSS, and may be introduced as such or as a slurry in water or fuel oil. The fluidized bed is preferably supported on a perforated base through which the oxygen-containing gas is admitted, the orifices preferably being such that the pressure drop across the base is between 0,1 and 20 times the pressure drop across the bed, and preferably being fitted with devices which prevent solids entering the orifices. The oxygen-containing gas may be air, preferably heated to 250 DEG -600 DEG C., and the bed is preferably maintained at 700 DEG -1100 DEG C. The process is preferably so operated that the iron oxide product contains less than 5% carbon and 1% sulphur, and that the emergent gas contains up to 15% sulphur dioxide and less than 6% oxygen, preferably less than 3% oxygen. The exiting gases are preferably cooled to below 350 DEG C., for example by passing through a waste heat boiler, before separating out, for example in a cyclone, the ion oxide; any residual iron oxide may be removed by a water spray. Sulphur dioxide thereby dissolved may be stripped by means of an air stream.

In one disclosed embodiment of the invention, the user (10) carries or wears an identification badge (18) that includes a transponder for sending preliminary identification data to an access controller (14) as the user approaches a door (12) through which access is controlled. The controller (14) uses the preliminary identification data, such as an account number or employee number, to access a fingerprint database (44) and retrieve reference fingerprint data previously stored there during an enrollment procedure. If the user's identification includes a ""smart card,"" the reference fingerprint data may stored in the card instead of in the database (44). The retrieved reference fingerprint data are then compared, in a fingerprint correlator (46), with a subject fingerprint image obtained from the user (10) through a fingerprint sensor (16) located near, or integrated into the door (12). A successful match in the correlator (46) verifies the preliminary identification data and results in access to the door or machine being granted to the user.

A cutter for cutting the edges of, sheet material, such as resilient flexible floor covering 37, 38 to be joined in a tight butt joint, comprises a motor-driven saw blade 19 on a base 10 adapted to be supported from a floor, a guide 24 for positioning the blade relative to the edge of one of the sheets, and a sheet material support 21 carried by the cutter above the level of the floor for supporting two sheets in overlapping relationship for simultaneous cutting while supported off the surface of the floor. The base is supported from the floor by rollers 11 and carries a motor 14, the shaft 18 of which mounts the saw blade 19 extending through a slot 20 in the base. The support 21 is formed with a web 24 which acts both as a guide for the edge of the sheet 38 and carries a plate 25 for supporting the sheet 38. A second web 26 serves both as a guide for the edge of the sheet 37 and supports from the plate 25 a second plate 27 for supporting the sheet 37. The saw blade extends through a slot 28 in plate 25 and into a recess in plate 27 so that as the cutter is moved along the floor, both edges of the sheets are cut. A plate 30, Fig. 5, carried by the base in the plane of the blade extends into the kerf formed by the blade. When the sheets are removed from the support and placed on the floor, the cut edges tightly abut. A fan wheel is driven by a motor 35 and expels into a porous bag. In another embodiment, the base 10<1>, Figs. 6 and 7, is supported by adjustable rollers, and the sheets of material are supported by a shoe 42 carried by a plate 75 which is disposed in the plane of the blade 19 to engage the kerf formed thereby and is adjustable by a screw 74. The edge of the sheet material 371 is engaged by the edge. 54 of a guide 50. The shoe 42 is provided with a plough 49 for removing wet adhesive from the area of the sheets to be cut. The motor 14<1> is mounted on a pivot, whereby the blade may be moved from its cutting position.",ARMSTRONG CORK CO,AULERICH ARTHUR J;;HEIDEN RAYMOND W;;WOOLEY JAMES B;;EVANS RICHARD J,,https://lens.org/007-321-661-646-661,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,4,0,B26B25/00;;E04F21/22,B26B25/00;;E04F21/22,B5L LK            LK;;B5L L102          LK;;B5L L2            -;;B5L L5C           -;;B5L L5D           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Each piece of equipment or a mounting therefor is provided with at least two instruments at known angles to one another, each instrument having an axis and being capable of giving a reading which is a function of the magnitude of the component of the Earth's gravitational field along that axis at any moment. Other items of equipment or a datum pad are similarly provided with such at least two instruments and then readings are taken of all the instruments with the aircraft or ship placed in two different angular positions in relation to the Earth's gravitational field. The mountings are then adjusted, in the light of the readings, into a desired angular relationship to one another or the existing angular relationship is determined. An aircraft may be placed in said two angular positions by rocking it in pitch about the ground wheels or a ship, e.g. a submarine may be tilted in pitch or roll by movement of ballast. The reading instruments may be levels or accelerometers.",BRITISH AIRCRAFT CORP LTD,DALY MARTIN ARTHUR KIRKPAT RIC;;SQUIRE ALLAN MAURICE;;THOMPSON GEOFFREY;;EVANS ALFRED ROBERT,,https://lens.org/047-063-874-132-623,Granted Patent,no,0,7,1,1,0,G01C25/00,G01C25/00,B7A A16           -;;B7V VML1          VML;;B7W WX            WX;;B7W W3X           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A slot nozzle die has elongated air slots along a vertically oriented slot extrusion opening. A hot melt or wax gun is disposed above the bottle neck to apply a bead of adhesive to the bottle top. In the operation of the apparatus, the air flow is initiated from both air slots prior to the initiation of the hot melt flow and is continued beyond that point in time, when the hot melt flow ceases. The air carries a film of coating material horizontally to the bottle neck. Means are provided for spinning the bottle about its vertical axis. The delays between the operations of the air flow and the coating flow are on the order of micro seconds. The merged coatings are heated to smooth the coating finish to produce a traditional neck seal.",NORDSON CORP,HAUSER LARRY;;BENECKE JURGEN;;CIEPLIK ARTHUR;;BURMESTER THOMAS;;GILL MICHAEL L;;WASHINGTON KERRY;;EVANS RON,NORDSON CORPORAITON (1992-07-10),https://lens.org/045-079-788-357-942,Granted Patent,yes,59,49,3,3,0,B05C5/0212;;B05C5/0212;;B05B7/0861;;B05B7/0861;;B05C5/0258;;B05C5/0258;;B05C5/0275;;B05C5/0275;;B05C5/0283;;B05C5/0283;;B05C11/06;;B05C11/06;;B05C13/025;;B05C13/025;;B05D3/042;;B05D3/042;;B67B5/05;;B67B5/05;;Y10S118/02;;Y10S118/02,B05B7/08;;B05C5/02;;B05C11/06;;B05C13/02;;B05D3/04;;B67B5/05,118/696;;118/58;;118/320;;X118DIG 2;;215/12.2;;239/299;;239/562;;239/565;;239/568;;239/597,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
