   Methods and systems are provided to manage communications in networks having wired and wireless portions. By determining the optimum segment size for a wireless link based on various status conditions such as bit-error rates, data throughput across the wireless link can be improved. Accordingly, data received from a wired network can be repackaged using the desired segment size before being transmitted over the wireless link. Similarly, optimum-sized segments can be received from the wireless link and the data in the received segments can be passed to the wired network.

   Methods and systems are provided to manage communications in networks having wired and wireless portions. By determining the optimum segment size for a wireless link based on various status conditions such as bit-error rates, data throughput across the wireless link can be improved. Accordingly, data received from a wired network can be repackaged using the desired segment size before being transmitted over the wireless link. Similarly, optimum-sized segments can be received from the wireless link and the data in the received segments can be passed to the wired network.

The recombinant virus vector comprises at least one pair of nucleotide sequences heterologous to the virus and which have sufficient sequence homology that recombination between them might be expected. The pair of nucleotide sequences are arranged in the virus vector such that they are inverted with respect to each other. The virus vector is able to infect a mammalian host cell and express as polypeptide the heterologous nucleotide sequences in the host cell. For infection thought to be caused by HPV infection, the pair of nucleotide sequences encode part or all of human papillomavirus (HPV) wild-type proteins or mutant proteins immunologically cross-reactive therewith.

The stabilizing copper layer has a sufficient amount of copper to balance the chemical potential gradient of copper across the barrier layer and prevent copper within the first copper layer from diffusing across the barrier layer. Alternatively, a sufficient amount of copper can be included within the tin-based solder bump to prevent copper from diffusing across the barrier layer.

The method for erasure in a magneto-electrophoretic medium containing particles provides for the supply of a non-electrical stimulus to a magneto-electrophoretic medium and the simultaneous supply of a subthreshold voltage to a magneto-electrophoretic medium, thereby initiating the switching of the magneto-electrophoretic medium from the first state to the second state. In this case, the threshold voltage exceeds zero, but is not sufficient to initiate the switching of the magneto-electrophoretic medium from the first state to the second state within five seconds.EFFECT: invention provides local erasure in combination with a subthreshold electric field and a non-electric stimulus.26 cl, 32 dwg",E INK CORP,NGUYEN CRYSTAL;;GRIFFITH EVAN;;BISHOP SETH J;;TELFER STEPHEN J;;LADAVAC KOSTA;;DRABEK ANDREW A;;SAINIS SUNIL KRISHNA;;PAOLINI RICHARD J JR;;MORRILL SAMANTHA,,https://lens.org/191-934-127-993-560,Granted Patent,no,3,0,19,19,0,G06F3/03545;;G06F3/0383;;G02F1/1673;;G02F1/1685;;G02F1/1685;;G02F1/166;;G02F1/1675;;G09G3/344;;G02F1/1685;;G06F3/03545;;G06F3/0383;;G02F1/1685;;G02F1/1673;;G02F1/167,G02F1/1685,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

    A spool slides in a bore to open and close a valve. The spool moves in a first direction until the spool forcibly engages a seat in the bore, closing the valve. The spool moves in a second direction opposite the first direction so that the spool disengages with the seat, opening the valve. Proper configuration of the spool and bore geometries in the vicinity of the seat keeps static pressure from developing that could otherwise retard spool valve opening.

SOLUTION: A spool 109 slides within a bore and opens and closes a valve 101. An armature 165 movable with respect to the spool is biased in a first direction. A coupled biasing member biases the armature and the spool toward each other. When the solenoid 169 is actuated, the armature and the spool move in a second direction opposite to the first direction, and the spool is tightly engaged with a valve seat 113 within the bore. Thus, the valve is closed and the spool stops moving. Thereafter, the armature continues to move in the second direction and the coupled biasing member further applies force to the spool. Thus, the spool is held in engagement with the valve seat, and the armature reaches a second position at which the armature is tightly engaged with the spool. Accordingly, the armature stops further moving in the second direction. However, the standing-still armature continues to apply pressure to the spool to thereby hold the spool in engagement with the valve seat. When the voltage of the solenoid is cut off, the armature moves back in the first direction by the biasing force of the armature until the armature abuts against the spool. Thus, the spool is quickly moved away from the valve seat and the valve is opened.",CATERPILLAR INC,LEWIS STEPHEN R;;LOONEY CHARLES B;;MITZELFELT JR LARRY R;;MARTIN DAVID E;;GRIFFITH JAMES D;;CARON KENNETH A;;GROFF WILLIAM T;;J DWAIN MANAHAN;;AVTER S SANDYU;;WAYDE J LOBEL,,https://lens.org/168-057-233-731-673,Patent Application,no,0,0,6,6,0,F02M63/0017;;F02M63/004;;F16K31/0668;;F02M63/0022;;Y10T137/0318;;Y10T137/0318;;F16K31/0668;;F02M63/0017;;F02M63/004;;F02M63/0022,F02M51/00;;F02M59/46;;F16K3/24;;F16K3/314;;F16K31/06,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Der Anker bewegt sich weiter in der zweiten Richtung, was bewirkt, daß die Kupplung zusätzliche Kraft aufbringt, um den Kolben gegen den Sitz in Eingriff zu halten, bis der Anker eine zweite Position erreicht, wo er durch Kraft mit dem Kolben in Eingriff kommt. Dies stoppt die Bewegung des Ankers weiter in der zweiten Richtung, gestattet es jedoch dem stationären Anker, weiter eine Kraft aufzubringen, um den Kolben gegen den Sitz in Eingriff zu halten.

The armature continues to move in the second direction, causing the coupling to apply additional force to keep the spool engaged against the seat, until the armature reaches a second position where it forcibly engages with the spool. This stops the armature from moving further in the second direction, but allows the stationary armature to continue applying force to keep the spool engaged against the seat. When the solenoid is de-energized the armature bias sends the armature back in the first direction until it strikes the spool, causing the spool to rapidly unseat, thus opening the valve. Proper configuration of the spool and bore geometries in the vicinity of the seat keeps static pressure from developing that could otherwise retard spool valve opening.",CATERPILLAR INC,LEWIS STEPHEN R;;LOONEY CHARLES B;;MITZELFELT JR LARRY R;;MARTIN DAVID E;;GRIFFITH JAMES D;;CARON KENNETH A;;GROFF WILLIAM T;;MANAHAN J DUWAYNE;;SANDHU AVTAR S;;ROBEL WADE J,CATERPILLAR INC (1998-08-10),https://lens.org/169-621-760-128-172,Granted Patent,yes,11,12,6,6,0,F02M63/0017;;F02M63/004;;F16K31/0668;;F02M63/0022;;Y10T137/0318;;Y10T137/0318;;F16K31/0668;;F02M63/0017;;F02M63/004;;F02M63/0022,F02M59/46;;F02M51/00;;F16K3/24;;F16K3/314;;F16K31/06,137/1;;251/77;;251/129.02;;251/129.19;;251/176,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Particularly, the invention provides a resistive heating element formed of a conductive substrate. The conductive substrate comprises an electrically conductive material and a carbonaceous additive, such as a binder material. The conductive substrate is carbonized in that it is subjected to calcining conditions to effectively reduce the carbonaceous additive to its carbon skeleton. It has been found that such carbonized substrate has surprisingly improved resistance properties in relation a substrate of the same formulation that is not carbonized. The carbonized substrate can include an aerosol precursor material.
