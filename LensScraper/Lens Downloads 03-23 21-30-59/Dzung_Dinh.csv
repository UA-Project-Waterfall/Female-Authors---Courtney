Parameters, such as force and temperature, are detected based on measuring a change in electrical resistance of the semiconductor material due to the piezoresistive effect and/or the thermoresistive effect. An external potential difference can be applied between the pair of electrodes to create a tuning current to modulate the piezoresistive and thermoresistive effects in the semiconductor junction. The sensing platform is used for highly sensitive force sensors and highly sensitive temperature sensors.",UNIV GRIFFITH,DZUNG VIET DAO;;TOAN DINH;;THANH NGUYEN,,https://lens.org/057-228-010-786-473,Granted Patent,no,1,1,9,9,0,G01L1/186;;G01L5/162;;G01K7/16;;H01L31/161;;H01L31/08;;H01L21/02447;;H01L21/02167;;H01L29/66219;;G01L1/18;;G01L9/06;;G01L9/0052;;G01L19/0092;;H01L31/08,G01L1/18;;G01L9/06,,1,1,018-185-465-567-232,10.1021/acsami.7b12128;;29098850,"ABU RIDUAN MD FOISAL ET AL: ""Pushing the Limits of Piezoresistive Effect by Optomechanical Coupling in 3C-SiC/Si Heterostructure"", ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES, vol. 9, no. 46, 22 November 2017 (2017-11-22), US, pages 39921 - 39925, XP055673327, ISSN: 1944-8244, DOI: 10.1021/acsami.7b12128",ACTIVE

The method includes the step of communicating the set of graphics data to a graphics library using an application programming interface (API) call to the graphics library. The graphics library includes at least one application API interface. The method includes the step of providing a sniffing module. The sniffing module intercepts the set of graphics data before the set of graphics data reaches the GPU. The sniffing module copies the set of graphics data to create a copy of the graphics data. The sniffing module forwards the copy of the graphics data to the graphics library for rendering to a receiving entity.",KHAC DZUNG DINH;;NGUYEN HA VIET;;GUPTA SUMIT,KHAC DZUNG DINH;;NGUYEN HA VIET;;GUPTA SUMIT,,https://lens.org/072-499-578-654-850,Patent Application,yes,0,5,1,1,0,A63F13/86;;A63F13/86;;G06T1/20;;G06T1/20;;G06F3/147;;G06F3/147;;G09G5/003;;G09G5/026;;G09G5/026;;G09G5/363;;G09G5/363;;G09G5/397;;G09G5/397;;G09G2340/06;;G09G2340/06;;G09G2340/14;;G09G2340/14;;G09G2340/16;;G09G2340/16;;G09G2360/18;;G09G2360/18;;G09G2370/022,G06T1/20;;A63F13/50;;G06T1/60;;G06T15/20,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
