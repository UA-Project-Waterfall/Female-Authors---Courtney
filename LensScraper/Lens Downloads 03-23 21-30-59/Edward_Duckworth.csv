Radiolocation. MINISTER OF SUPPLY. Nov. 4, 1946, No. 32664. [Class 40 (vii)] A radar system comprises at least two aerials of the type which employ mirror reflectors, the reflectors being shaped to produce optimum response at different angles of elevation ; the aerials are rotated and fed in turn, and the received echoes appear simultaneously on one or more cathode-ray tube displays. The embodiment disclosed is an airfield-control radar and has two mirror aerials 1, 2 mounted backto-back on a housing 7 containing the transmitting and receiving equipment, and rotatable about a column 22 on a base 23. Mirror 1 is a paraboloid producing a narrow low-angle beam for long-range detection and mirror 2 a distorted paraboloid producing a high-angle beam suitable for short-range detection with the minimum of ground clutter, the combination of beams providing adequate coverage at all ranges and heights required for airfield control. The transmitter 6 feeds the mirrors alternately through branched wave-guides, each containing a ring switch 8, 9 of the type disclosed in Specification 597,216, the rings being disposed at 90 degrees to each other and rotated by a motor also driving a synchronizing wave-form generator 12 from the transmitter and displays. The generator feeds into a control unit 15 which produces negative locking pulses for the transmitter modulator to ensure that the transmitter pulses with the ring switches in the correct position, and alternate negative and positive pulses to synchronize the display time bases. Displays of the planposition type are employed and polarity discrimination in the synchronizing pulses is necessary since the aerials face in opposing directions and the time bases must be reversed. The aerials function for both transmitting and receiving and employ switching means as disclosed in Specification 583,743. A trolley supports the assembly so that the system may be moved into any desired position relatively to the airfield control tower, the supplies and signals being conveyed by line and connected through slip rings 27 and a rotary coupling 29. The displays are located in the control tower and the received echo signals pass to the displays at the intermediate frequency. A Selsyn motor 32 repeats the aerial bearing to the displays. Preferably the displays have a second rotatable time-base under the control of an independent direction-finding aerial. The second time-base is used to produce a radial trace only on receipt of signals from a transmitting aircraft so that when the second trace intersects an echo on the radar display, identification of that echo with the transmitting aircraft is achieved. The housing 7 includes an air-circulating fan 35 and drying agents 34.",MINI OF SUPPLY,DUCKWORTH JOHN CLIFFORD;;BACON GEORGE EDWARD;;CHISHOLM JOHN,,https://lens.org/091-274-267-445-05X,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,G01S13/762;;G01S1/02,G01S1/02;;G01S13/76,H1Q QAX           AX,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
