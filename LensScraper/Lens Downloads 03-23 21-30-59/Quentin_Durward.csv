Limbs, artificial. - Comprises a gripping-device attachable to an artificial arm and so jointed as to simulate the action of the wrist. A shank 1 is revolubly mounted in an artificial cuff 3 and receives the plates 4, 5 attached to the U-shaped body 6 of the rigid jaw 12, a bolt 8 being passed through to form a pivot. A clamping-nut 11 on the shank engages the top plate 4 to hold the rigid jaw in an adjusted position. The movable jaw 15 is hinged on a shaft 16 carried by a U-shaped rigidjaw member 6, a pair of springs 18 keeping the jaws normally open. Depending from a shaft 16<1> carried by the movable jaw 15 are spaced ratchet bars 19 connected by springs 22 to a lip on a yoke 25 pivoted on the shaft 16<1> and having a slotted bearing thereon. The ratchet bars 19 pass through openings 20 in the fixed jaw and engage a dog 21. To grip a plough handle or the like, the jaws are placed astride the handle, and the hinged jaw closed over it by the other hand. The fixed dog 21 engages the ratchet bars and holds the jaws closed. Additional pressure may be given by a screw 24 which bears on the rear end of the yoke 25. A quick release is provided by a cord 33 moved from the shoulder which causes a lever 32 to move a disengaging-plate 27, Fig. 3, to push the ratchet bars away from the dog 21 against the influence of a spring 30. Hooks project laterally from the outer end of the rigid jaw for use in lifting and pulling, one of them having a hook-point adapted for buttoning wearing-apparel, lifting strings, &c.",CORLEY QUENTIN DURWARD,CORLEY QUENTIN DURWARD,,https://lens.org/040-362-160-421-103,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,A61F2/588,A61F2/58,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Limbs, artificial.-The fingers are adjustable into several positions by forming grooves 5 in their bases, into which a transverse loclcing-bar 6 is pressed by a spring 10. The bar can be retracted bv a cord 12. The thumb is pivoted on a stud 15 which carries a pulley segment 22 receiving the operating cord 23, and it is locked in the closed position by means of the ratchet 18 and pawl 19. For releasing the thumb, the cord 23 passes round a pulley 24 mounted on a dog 28. Tension of the cord causes the lip 33 of the dog to rotate the ratchet-wheel 29 and thereby the hexagonal cams 30 which depresses a sliding anglebar 31 having a shoe 32 bearing on the pawl 19. The pulley 22 is now free to be retracted by the spring 27 on relaxing the cord, the dog 28 riding back over the rack 29.

Limbs, artificial.-An arm is provided with various means for grasping and manipulating objects and is designed so that the objects can be manipulated and the arm fitted on the person by people who have lost both hands. A forearm socket 1 is articulated to a divided sleeve 2 laced on the upper arm, and the laces are passed finally round friction hooks acting as locking-devices to prevent the lace from running back, thus enabling the wearer to draw the laces tight by holding the ends in his teeth. The lower end of the socket 1 carries a double clutch operated by the screw 15, which has an elongated head adapted to he rotated by the teeth or by friction against a table. The two clutch elements 13, 17 form part of a guided hollow rectangular frame 12. The element 17 co-operates with a slotted plate 16 and a socket 18 to hold the handles of knives, forks, &c., which are picked up by sliding the pointed end 19 of the socket underneath them. The element 13 co-operates with a fixed clutch element 10 to grasp a grooved stud 26 on the end of a combined hook and spring grasping-device, shown in Fig. 3. The upper member 21 is formed with long and short hooks 22, 23 respectively, which have hooked points 24 arranged as shown. The lower member 27 is spaced from the plate 21 and is provided with a depression 28 at an angle with its main axis. This member only extends laterally under the longer hook 22 and normally abuts against the under surface of the hook, except at the extreme end 29, which is curved downwardly and reduced to a fine edge to facilitate insertion under an object, such as a sheet of paper or a coin. By rotating a ratchet-wheel 30 carrying three cams 30<1>, the member 27 is alternately sprung downwards into the position shown in dotted lines in Fig. 1 and released again. Suitable objects may thus be grasped between the hook 22 and the member 27. Round objects, such as pencils, are additionally supported in the depression 28, as shown in dotted lines in Fig. 3. To operate the ratchet-wheel, the wearer first bends the forearm and pushes the pawl lever 31 in an anti-clockwise direction with his teeth. Then, on straightening the arm, the lever is moved in a clockwise direction through the medium of the cord 34 to operate the ratchet-wheel. The main hooks 22, 23 are used for lifting purposes, while the hooked points 24 are stated to be useful for buttoning clothes, opening purses, and tying and untying strings.",CORLEY QUENTIN DURWARD,CORLEY QUENTIN DURWARD,,https://lens.org/102-722-372-316-480,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,A61F2/588,A61F2/58,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
