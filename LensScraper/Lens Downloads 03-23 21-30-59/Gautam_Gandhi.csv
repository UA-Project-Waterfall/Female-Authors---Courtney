It comprises a common base plate insert molded with copper strips that provide electrical connectivity between connector area (5g) and switch modules. The Insert molding of copper strips is achieved by providing links between copper strips by providing cross connections near their terminals to obtain a single piece of a mesh of copper strips, which is insert molded in a common base plate, and after the step of insertion of the copper strip mesh in the base plate is complete, the links are delinked by piercing through holes provided in the base plate and breaking the links. This step results in elimination of the need of wiring harness. This common base plate insert molded with copper strips is snap fitted with the switch module/s to provide a sub-assembly; which is mounted on a casing.",VARROC ENG LTD,DAS ASHOK KUMAR;;GANDHI PRERAK;;BANKAR UDAY GAUTAM;;KASHYAP JAYSHANKAR;;IJARE RAMESH,,https://lens.org/087-438-698-273-812,Patent Application,yes,2,0,1,1,0,B62J6/16;;H01H9/06;;H01H2009/068;;H01H11/0056;;H01H1/58;;H01H9/04;;B62J3/12;;B62J6/16,H01H9/06;;B62J6/16;;B62K11/14,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The gravity-fed housing has a receiving end panel that forms a receive opening in a first plane. The receive opening is configured to receive a first plurality of heat carriers via gravity. The gravity-fed housing includes a siding connected to the receiving end panel. The siding forms a chamber and a discharge opening in a second plane that is parallel to the first plane. The discharge opening is offset with respect to the receive opening such that a line perpendicular to the receiving end panel that extends through a center point of the receive opening does not intersect a center point of the second opening. The siding includes a first panel that comprises a guiding surface that intersects the line and is angled toward the discharge opening.
