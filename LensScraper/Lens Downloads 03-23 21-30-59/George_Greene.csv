GREENE. 3 Aug., 1966 [26 Aug., 1965], No. 34715/66. Heading B6F. [Also in Division G4] Type-bar machines; perforated record controlled character selection; power assisted type actions: permutation type selecting arrangements.-A power operated typewriter, having type bars b1, Fig. 2, operated by cams S which engage a continuously rotating roller 23 when a type action k enters an aligned slot in six permutation bars d and when a cam shaft 60 driven by a one-revolution clutch 102 presents a flat cam surface 61a to the type action k, is provided with a perforated card or tape reader 107 which selectively energizes one or more pneumatic conduits 149 associated with pulsators 105 such that the latter may displace their associated permutation bars d to effect the type selection. Pneumatic key and type selection arrangements.-Pneumatic type selection is effected by a motor driven pulser bank 100, Fig. 2 associated with six pneumatic conduits 114, one for each perforation in a perforated tape or card, the conduits terminating in a reader 107 which, depending on the character to be selected, enables one or more pulsator selecting channels 149, which actuate respective permutation bars d, through the pulsators 105. The pulser bank 100, Fig. 4, includes six pulsers 108, each comprising a fixed plate 152, Fig. 11, and a pivotal plate 151, the plates being interconnected by a pouch 109. The fixed plate 152 includes a recess 159 associated with the conduit 114 which is connected with its other end to an appropriate one of six spigots 194 in a manifold 189 forming part of the tape reader 107. The pulsers 108 are actuated cyclically by a bar 122, Fig. 4, which is reciprocated by a cam slot 126 through a pin 125 attached to the bar 122. The cam slot is provided at one end of a shaft 127 which is driven by a one revolution clutch. Actuation of the pulsers 108 induces creation of vacuum in the conduits 114 and application of the vacuum to all the chambers 196, Fig. 8, associated with respective conduits 114, whereby selected chambers 196 are vented to atmosphere by spring valves 227 whose coils are opened by deflection of associated rods 185, when a projection 183 on the reader arm 180 senses a hole 204 in the perforated tape 175. The conduits 149 associated with opened valves are thus vented to atmosphere and the pulsators 105 are disabled. Each of the conduits 149 which is associated with no hole in the tape is then subjected to the vacuum pulse applied by the pulser 108 and the pulsator 105 connected to the relevent conduit 149 is activated by pivoting of the movable plate 153, Fig. 11, against the bias of a spring 155 towards the fixed plate 152 to displace the permutation bar d provided with a pair of depending lugs 161, which are engaged by the movable plate 153. The conduits 149 are then vented to atmosphere by a cam 191 which is mounted on a shaft 192. In another embodiment the cam 191 is omitted and the chamber 196 is provided with an orifice 197, Fig. 34, which vents the chamber 196, which has been subjected to vacuum, to atmosphere after a time delay . In a further embodiment the chamber 196, Fig. 36 (not shown), is provided with an orifice 198 which is obturated by a check valve (199) lifted only if the pressure in the conduit exceeds the atmospheric pressure as a result of closure of the pulsator 105. The arrangement permits the pulsator 105 to be actuated repeatedly as long as no hole is being sensed in the tape. In a still further embodiment the coiled valve 219, Fig. 39, is totally enclosed in bellows 213 such that on flexing of the valve rod 209, i.e. when a hole is sensed, the pulser conduit 211 is connected to the pulsator conduit 216 by the open coils 210 of the coiled valve 219. The pulsator conduit 216 is vented to atmosphere by using again the venting valve which deflects the valve rod 209 and by connecting the pulsator conduit 216 to atmosphere. In a final embodiment the reader is modified by replacing the manifold 189 with a manifold 234, Fig. 43, which is provided with U-shaped channels 245, one for each transverse hole in the tape 175 and representing each character on the tape by two rows of transverse holes (Fig. 44) to provide the respective binary states of ""1"" and ""0"". Each of the channels 245 is connected to a respective vacuum line 247 which is activated cyclically by a pulser 208 for application of vacuum to the line. The shanks 243, 244 are obturated by the tape 175 for selective connection to the conduits 249, 250 which correspond to the binary states ""1"" and ""0"", respectively, and which are connected to the respective ends of a pulsator 237 having a central pivotal plate 231 which when oscillated actuates the type selecting slide d. The pulsator 237 acts as a pushpull device.

OF CALIFORNIA. 11 June, 1968, No. 27626/68. Heading F2V. [Also in Division G4] A bail valve for fluid operated data processing and process control devices comprises tubular actuating member 10, whose ends are fluidtightly joined to coil springs 11, 12 also fluidtightly joined to stems 15, 16 of which 15 is closed at the outer end while 16 is tubular and connected over flexible tube 18 to a fluidic information transmission channel having a manifold 20, pulsator 22, and pulser 24. The stems are flexibly suspended from frame members and supported on recessed cradles 40, 42. Code bars 45 to 92 as described e.g. in Specification 1,159,474 are disposed adjacent the underside of the tube to be lifted in unique combinations by individual typewriter keys, code recesses being arranged in the top of each code bar in a unique permutation corresponding to the associated key. An array of 8 valves each has an associated fluidic transmission channel, and depression of each typewriter key vents a unique channel combination, decoupling corresponding pulsaters 22 from pulsers 24 and operating a tape punch as described e.g. in Specification 1,059,625. Lifting of the tube by a code bar (Fig. 2, not shown) flexes the suspensions and springs, so that the turns of the latter open. In a modification, the cradles are eliminated and the tube may be deflected in two perpendicular directions by corresponding sets of code bars. The suspenders may be rigid and pivoted, while member 10 may be solid and stem 15 may be tubular with corresponding connecting tubing. Alternatively stem 15 and member 10 may be solid, in which case one spring only acts as a valve.

   A pump monitoring and flow control system that provides direct indication of discharge flow on a positive displacement or diaphragm injection-type pumps. The device uses a tell-tale check valve that drives a proximity switch each time the valve, installed as the output check valve on a standard injection pump, opens with discharge flow. The proximity switch in turn signals the monitoring system while flow control is accomplished through an adjustable volume chamber in series with the output check valve.

Dredging.-Relates to dredging - machines con- sisting essentially of one or more endless chains or series of buckets E arranged to revolve round a supporting-float B, which is adjustably connected to the bow of an adjacent hull or boat A carrying the means for actuating the buckets or for carrying the engines, boilers, pumps, electric generators, and other machinery. The float B is connected to the boat A by the sliding frame C, and the vertical adjustment of the float may be effected or assisted by flooding or emptying its interior. The buckets E, Fig. 5, have supporting-wheels f to travel on the circular tracks d, and each bucket has a hinged bottom, which is allowed to fall when the latch e<2> strikes the fixed finger e<3>. Chains or cables passing over drums drive the chains of buckets, and each chain of buckets may be driven independently. The endless carrier H for the spoil is arranged in the open passage G in the top of the cylindrical float B ; or a pair of short conveyers may be em- ployed. The lower compartments b<2>, b<3> of the float are connected with an electrically-actuated drainage pump b<4> located within the float. The pump and flooding-valves are controlled electrically from the boat A. To deliver the spoil at a distant point, a long endless conveyer supported on a scow or float is employed. In a modified form of dredging-apparatus, the chain of buckets pass round the hull or boat A, and the float or drum B is small and is submerged in deep dredging.",POWELL GEORGE GREENE,POWELL GEORGE GREENE,,https://lens.org/097-460-806-845-245,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Automatic position control systems. ELECTROCIRCUITS Inc. June 1, 1956, No. 17085/56. Class 38 (4). In an apparatus for maintaining a predetermined spatial relationship between two objects not exceeding a few feet apart and one of which for example a camera is adjustably supported in space, two sources of ultrasonic waves affixed to the adjustable object and directed towards the other object are coupled to the other object through a fluid medium and a signal dependent on the time intervals of propagation from and reflection to each of the sources is used to control the relative positions of the objects. Ultrasonic transducers 66-68, Fig. 3, which may be of the quartz crystal or magneto-strictive type, are arranged in the manner shown in Fig. 4, on the face of the object 60 which is mounted in gymbals on a slidably mounted shaft 64, to direct pulses of ultrasonic energy of different frequencies at the other object in response to pulses from a modulator 70 applied through matching networks 71. The reflected pulses from the other object received by the three transducers which have different fundamental frequencies are applied with the pulses from the modulator to selective receivers 72-74 and thence to time discriminators 75-78 which each deliver a signal when the time interval between propagation and reflection differs from a predetermined interval. The signal from discriminator 78 drives the shaft 64 longitudinally through a servomotor 82 coupled to a pinion to maintain the desired spartial relationship, and the angular position of the object is the two sets of bearings of the gymbals is controlled by servomotors 86, 96 which respond respectively to the difference in output signals from discriminators 75 and 78, and the difference between the output of discriminator 76 and the average of the outputs from 75 and 78. Systems are described with reference to Figs. 1 and 2 (not shown), which relate to maintaining the spatial relationship only and turning the object about a single axis as well as maintaining the spatial relationship, respectively. Narrow crystals, lensed crystals or irised crystals may be used to give a desirable beam and any number of crystals may be employed. A computer may be used to produce a time varied signal so that the objects may be caused to approach or recede from each other in any computed path. Time delays may be introduced to prevent hunting.",ELECTROCIRCUITS INC,ERDMAN DONALD CALVIN;;GREENE GEORGE BOYD,,https://lens.org/021-286-898-182-304,Granted Patent,no,0,4,1,1,0,G01S7/521;;G01S1/02,G01S1/02;;G01S7/521,G3R RA273         BC23;;G3R RBC23         BC23,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Air conditioning; systems for heating & cooling buildings. INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ELECTRIC CORPORATION. 11 June, 1965, No. 24750/65. Headings F4U and F4V. A heat exchanger 38 in an air conditioning unit comprises a number of individual elements fed from a supply line 52 via a valve 50 and lines 44a-d, the valve 50 controlling the supply of heat exchange fluid to the elements sequentially under the control of a room temperature senser. The elements have common fins 46, which have slots 48 between the coils. The valve 50 has an inlet line 52 and includes a valve body (98), Figs. 6 and 7 (not shown), having a slot (100) which when the valve is closed passes fluid from the line 52 to a drain line 54 but which as the valve is opened uncovers in turn the outlets to lines 44a-d until all those lines are open. A valve arrangement 58, 60 allows the heat exchanger to be connected with hot or cold water supply systems. The air conditioning unit, Fig. 2 (not shown), comprises a fresh air inlet (24), a room air inlet (22), a proportioning damper (34) and a fan (32). The fresh and room air streams pass through filters (26) and (28) and the water supply pipe for the heat exchanger 38 are embedded in insulation (42). The valve 50 may be arranged on the outlet side of the heat exchanger, Fig. 12 (not shown) and a single valve may control both the hot and cold water supply, Figs. 13 and 14 (not shown). The valve may be under the additional control of a temperature senser located immediately downstream of the fan (32), Fig. 5 (not shown).",INT STANDARD ELECTRIC CORP,GREENE ROBERT WALTER;;HAUFLER GEORGE JOSEPH,,https://lens.org/192-819-026-100-770,Granted Patent,no,0,5,1,1,0,F24F3/08;;F24F5/00,F24F3/08;;F24F5/00,F4U UC            UC;;F4U U22           -;;F4U U22A          U22;;F4U U42D1A        UC;;F4U U42D2A        UC;;F4U U42D2E        UC;;F4U U42D4F        UC;;F4V VB1D          -;;F4V VB2A          -;;F4V VB4A          -;;F4V VB4B          -;;F4V VB4E          -;;F4V VGAB          GAB;;F4V VG212         GAB;;F4V VG225         GAB;;F4V VG228         GAB;;F4V VG241         GAB;;F4V V302          -;;F4V V302          GAB;;F4V V305          -;;F4V V305          GAB;;F4V V307          -;;F4V V307          GAB,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A wire nail for use with a powered nail-driving tool has a full-round head with an axis that is offset from an axis of the integrally formed shank. An outer circumferential surface of the shank is at least as offset from the shank axis in one radial direction as a circumferential surface of the head in that radial direction. Accordingly, such nails may be collated shank-to-shank in a strip of wire nails such that adjoining shanks are both parallel and touching. During manufacture of the wire nail, a notch is formed in the shank at the intersection between the shank and the head. The notch and the head axis are disposed on opposite sides of the shank axis from each other. The notch facilitates improved metal flow during the head-forming procedure and results in strong shank to head connections.

The deployment tube includes a distal section terminating in an open distal end, with a lumen defined between the proximal and distal ends. A retention sleeve is fixed around the distal section and includes a distal extension extending a short distance past the distal end of the deployment tube. The emovascular device is attached to the distal end of the deployment robe during the manufacturing process by fixing the retention sleeve around the coupling element, so that the coupling element is releasably held within the distal extension of the deployment tube. In use, the deployment mbe, with the implant attached to its distal end, is passed though a microcatheter to a target vascular site until the endovascular device is deployed within the site. To detach the endovascular device from the deployment tube a biocompatible liquid is injected through the lumen of the deployment tube so as to apply pressure to the upstream side of the coupling element, which is thus pushed out of the retention sleeve by the fluid pressure, thereby detaching the endovascular device from the deployment tube. The coupling element may be a solid ""plug"" of polymeric material or metal, or it may be formed of a hydrophilic polymer that softens and becomes somewhat lubricious when contacted by the injected liquid. With the latter type of material, the hydration of the hydrophilic material results in physical changes that reduce the adhesion between the coupling element and the sleeve.

The deployment tube includes a distal section terminating in an open distal end, with a lumen defined between the proximal and distal ends. A retention sleeve is fixed around the distal section and includes a distal extension extending a short distance past the distal end of the deployment tube. The emovascular device is attached to the distal end of the deployment robe during the manufacturing process by fixing the retention sleeve around the coupling element, so that the coupling element is releasably held within the distal extension of the deployment tube. In use, the deployment mbe, with the implant attached to its distal end, is passed though a microcatheter to a target vascular site until the endovascular device is deployed within the site. To detach the endovascular device from the deployment tube a biocompatible liquid is injected through the lumen of the deployment tube so as to apply pressure to the upstream side of the coupling element, which is thus pushed out of the retention sleeve by the fluid pressure, thereby detaching the endovascular device from the deployment tube. The coupling element may be a solid ""plug"" of polymeric material or metal, or it may be formed of a hydrophilic polymer that softens and becomes somewhat lubricious when contacted by the injected liquid. With the latter type of material, the hydration of the hydrophilic material results in physical changes that reduce the adhesion between the coupling element and the sleeve. Alternatively, the coupling element can be made principally of a non-hydrophilic material, with a hydrophilic coating.",MICROVENTION INC,DAVID FERRERA;;GEORGE GREENE;;BRIAN COX;;ROBERT ROSENBLUTH,,https://lens.org/145-791-721-548-79X,Patent Application,no,0,1,23,23,0,A61B17/12022;;A61B17/1214;;A61B17/1215;;A61B17/12163;;A61B17/1219;;A61B2017/00477;;A61B2017/00535;;A61B2017/00539;;A61B2017/00867;;A61B2017/1205;;A61B2017/12054;;A61B17/1214;;A61B2017/00477;;A61B2017/1205;;A61B17/1215;;A61B2017/00867;;A61B17/12163;;A61B17/12022;;A61B17/1219;;A61B2017/00535;;A61B2017/12054;;A61B2017/00539,A61B17/00;;G09G3/20;;A61B17/12;;A61F2/06;;G09G5/02,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   A vascular implant formed of a compressible foam material has a compressed configuration from which it is expansible into a configuration substantially conforming to the shape and size of a vascular site to be embolized. Preferably, the implant is formed of a hydrophilic, macroporous foam material, having an initial configuration of a scaled-down model of the vascular site, from which it is compressible into the compressed configuration. The implant is made by scanning the vascular site to create a digitized scan data set; using the scan data set to create a three-dimensional digitized virtual model of the vascular site; using the virtual model to create a scaled-down physical mold of the vascular site; and using the mold to create a vascular implant in the form of a scaled-down model of the vascular site. To embolize a vascular site, the implant is compressed and passed through a microcatheter, the distal end of which has been passed into a vascular site. Upon entering the vascular site, the implant expands in situ substantially to fill the vascular site.

   A vascular implant formed of a compressible foam material has a compressed configuration from which it is expansible into a configuration substantially conforming to the shape and size of a vascular site to be embolized. Preferably, the implant is formed of a hydrophilic, macroporous foam material, having an initial configuration of a scaled-down model of the vascular site, from which it is compressible into the compressed configuration. The implant is made by scanning the vascular site to create a digitized scan data set; using the scan data set to create a three-dimensional digitized virtual model of the vascular site; using the virtual model to create a scaled-down physical mold of the vascular site; and using the mold to create a vascular implant in the form of a scaled-down model of the vascular site. To embolize a vascular site, the implant is compressed and passed through a microcatheter, the distal end of which has been passed into a vascular site. Upon entering the vascular site, the implant expands in situ substantially to fill the vascular site. A retention element is contained within the microcatheter and has a distal end detachably connected to the implant. A flexible, tubular deployment element is used to pass the implant and the retention element through the microcatheter, and then to separate the implant from the retention element when the implant has been passed out of the microcatheter and into the vascular site.

   A vascular implant formed of a compressible foam material has a compressed configuration from which it is expansible into a configuration substantially conforming to the shape and size of a vascular site to be embolized. Preferably, the implant is formed of a hydrophilic, macroporous foam material, having an initial configuration of a scaled-down model of the vascular site, from which it is compressible into the compressed configuration. The implant is made by scanning the vascular site to create a digitized scan data set; using the scan data set to create a three-dimensional digitized virtual model of the vascular site; using the virtual model to create a scaled-down physical mold of the vascular site; and using the mold to create a vascular implant in the form of a scaled-down model of the vascular site. To embolize a vascular site, the implant is compressed and passed through a microcatheter, the distal end of which has been passed into a vascular site. Upon entering the vascular site, the implant expands in situ substantially to fill the vascular site. A retention element is contained within the microcatheter and has a distal end detachably connected to the implant. A flexible, tubular deployment element is used to pass the implant and the retention element through the microcatheter, and then to separate the implant from the retention element when the implant has been passed out of the microcatheter and into the vascular site.

To embolize a vascular site, the implant is compressed and passed through a microcatheter, the distal end of which has been passed into a vascular site. Upon entering the vascular site, the implant expands in situ substantially to fill the vascular site. A retention element is contained within the microcatheter and has a distal end detachably connected to the implant.

    A vascular implant formed of a compressible foam material has a compressed configuration from which it is expansible into a configuration substantially conforming to the shape and size of a vascular site to be embodied. Preferably, the implant is formed of a hydrophobic, macro porous foam material, having an initial configuration of a scaled-down model of the vascular site, from which it is compressible into the compressed configuration. The implant is made by scanning the vascular site to create a digitized scan data set; using the scan data set to create a three-dimensional digitized virtual model of the vascular site; using the virtual model to create a scaled-down physical mold of the vascular site; and using the mold to create a vascular implant in the form of a scaled-down model of the vascular site. To embolism a vascular site, the implant is compressed and passed through a micro catheter, the distal end of which has been passed into a vascular site. Upon entering the vascular site, the implant expands in situ substantially to fill the vascular site. A retention element is contained within the micro catheter and has a distal end detachably connected to the implant. A flexible, tubular deployment element is used to pass the implant and the retention element through the micro catheter, and then to separate the implant from the retention element when the implant has been passed out of the micro catheter and into the vascular site.

The deployment tube includes a distal section terminating in an open distal end, with a lumen defined between the proximal and distal ends. A retention sleeve is fixed around the distal section and includes a distal extension extending a short distance past the distal end of the deployment tube. The emovascular device is attached to the distal end of the deployment robe during the manufacturing process by fixing the retention sleeve around the coupling element, so that the coupling element is releasably held within the distal extension of the deployment tube. In use, the deployment mbe, with the implant attached to its distal end, is passed though a microcatheter to a target vascular site until the endovascular device is deployed within the site. To detach the endovascular device from the deployment tube a biocompatible liquid is injected through the lumen of the deployment tube so as to apply pressure to the upstream side of the coupling element, which is thus pushed out of the retention sleeve by the fluid pressure, thereby detaching the endovascular device from the deployment tube. The coupling element may be a solid ""plug"" of polymeric material or metal, or it may be formed of a hydrophilic polymer that softens and becomes somewhat lubricious when contacted by the injected liquid. With the latter type of material, the hydration of the hydrophilic material results in physical changes that reduce the adhesion between the coupling element and the sleeve. Alternatively, the coupling element can be made principally of a non-hydrophilic material, with a hydrophilic coating.",MICROVENTION INC,FERRERA DAVID A;;GREENE GEORGE R JR;;COX BRIAN J,,https://lens.org/181-539-691-073-586,Patent Application,no,0,27,23,23,0,A61B17/12022;;A61B17/1214;;A61B17/1215;;A61B17/12163;;A61B17/1219;;A61B2017/00477;;A61B2017/00535;;A61B2017/00539;;A61B2017/00867;;A61B2017/1205;;A61B2017/12054;;A61B17/1214;;A61B2017/00477;;A61B2017/1205;;A61B17/1215;;A61B2017/00867;;A61B17/12163;;A61B17/12022;;A61B17/1219;;A61B2017/00535;;A61B2017/12054;;A61B2017/00539,A61B17/00;;A61B17/12;;A61F2/06,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

To embolize a vascular site, the implant is compressed and passed through a microcatheter, the distal end of which has been passed into a vascular site. Upon entering the vascular site, the implant expands in situ substantially to fill the vascular site. A retention element is contained within the microcatheter and has a distal end detachably connected to the implant.

Preferably, the implant is formed of a hydrophilic, macroporous foam material, having an initial configuration of a scaled-down model of the vascular site, from which it is compressible into the compressed configuration. The implant is made by scanning the vascular site to create a digitized scan data set; using the scan data set to create a three-dimensional digitized virtual model of the vascular site; using the virtual model to create a scaled-down physical mold of the vascular site; and using the mold to create a vascular implant in the form of a scaled-down model of the vascular site. To embolize a vascular site, the implant is compressed and passed through a microcatheter, the distal end of which has been passed into a vascular site. Upon entering the vascular site, the implant expands in situ substantially to fill the vascular site. A retention element is contained within the microcatheter and has a distal end detachably connected to the implant. A flexible, tubular deployment element is used to pass the implant and the retention element through the microcatheter, and then to separate the implant from the retention element when the implant has been passed out of the microcatheter and into the vascular site.",MICROVENTION INC,GREENE JR GEORGE R;;ROSENBLUTH ROBERT F;;COX BRIAN J,,https://lens.org/137-786-353-343-865,Granted Patent,yes,70,116,34,34,0,A61B17/12022;;A61B17/12113;;A61B17/12186;;A61B17/1219;;A61B2017/00526;;A61B2017/1205;;A61L31/145;;A61L31/18;;A61L2430/36;;Y10S623/901;;Y10S623/903;;A61B34/10;;Y10T29/49;;B33Y80/00;;B33Y50/00;;A61L31/146;;Y10T29/49;;A61F2/06;;B33Y80/00;;B33Y50/00;;A61B17/12022;;A61B17/12113;;A61B17/12186;;A61B17/1219;;A61B2017/00526;;A61B2017/1205;;A61L31/145;;A61L31/18;;A61L2430/36;;Y10S623/901;;Y10S623/903;;A61B34/10;;A61L31/146,A61B17/12;;A61B19/00;;A61F2/02;;A61L31/14;;A61L31/18,606/191;;623/903,13,10,039-941-366-524-82X;;055-136-753-175-146;;075-385-882-468-36X;;013-320-859-896-941;;052-240-636-117-781;;103-809-268-614-902;;066-118-816-330-546;;036-100-491-403-431;;064-489-224-739-970;;117-945-583-393-307,7678755;;10.1016/0142-9612(93)90072-a;;9029298;;10.1002/(sici)1097-4636(199702)34:2<183::aid-jbm7>3.3.co;2-b;;10.1002/(sici)1097-4636(199702)34:2<183::aid-jbm7>3.0.co;2-m;;441373;;10.1148/131.3.669;;10.3109/02652048909098026;;2723968;;9196336;;pmc2502901;;1880562;;10.1097/00004728-198709000-00012;;3655042;;10.1302/0301-620x.68b2.3958004;;3958004;;7543793;;10.1177/096368979500400305;;10.1016/0963-6897(95)00003-g;;2317539;;10.1016/0142-9612(90)90123-8,"Hawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary pp. 351-352.;;Chirila, Traian et al.; ""Poly [2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate] . . .

   A mechanism for the deployment of a filamentous endovascular device includes a flexible deployment tube having an open proximal end, and a coupling element attached to the proximal end of the endovascular device. The deployment tube includes a distal section terminating in an open distal end, with a lumen defined between the proximal and distal ends. A retention sleeve is fixed around the distal section and includes a distal extension extending a short distance past the distal end of the deployment tube. The endovascular device is attached to the distal end of the deployment tube by fixing the retention sleeve around the coupling element, so that the coupling element is releasably held within the distal extension of the deployment tube. In use, the deployment tube, with the implant attached to its distal end, is passed intravascularly through a microcatheter to a target vascular site until the endovascular device is located within the site. To detach the endovascular device from the deployment tube, a liquid is injected through the lumen of the deployment tube so as to apply pressure to the upstream side of the coupling element, which is thus pushed out of the retention sleeve by the fluid pressure. The coupling element may include an internal or peripheral purge passage that allows air to be purged from the microcatheter prior to the intravascular passage of the endovascular device.

The deployment tube includes a distal section terminating in an open distal end, with a lumen defined between the proximal and distal ends. A retention sleeve is fixed around the distal section and includes a distal extension extending a short distance past the distal end of the deployment tube. The emovascular device is attached to the distal end of the deployment robe during the manufacturing process by fixing the retention sleeve around the coupling element, so that the coupling element is releasably held within the distal extension of the deployment tube. In use, the deployment mbe, with the implant attached to its distal end, is passed though a microcatheter to a target vascular site until the endovascular device is deployed within the site. To detach the endovascular device from the deployment tube a biocompatible liquid is injected through the lumen of the deployment tube so as to apply pressure to the upstream side of the coupling element, which is thus pushed out of the retention sleeve by the fluid pressure, thereby detaching the endovascular device from the deployment tube. The coupling element may be a solid ""plug"" of polymeric material or metal, or it may be formed of a hydrophilic polymer that softens and becomes somewhat lubricious when contacted by the injected liquid. With the latter type of material, the hydration of the hydrophilic material results in physical changes that reduce the adhesion between the coupling element and the sleeve. Alternatively, the coupling element can be made principally of a non-hydrophilic material, with a hydrophilic coating.",MICROVENTION INC,FERRERA DAVID A;;GREENE GEORGE R;;COX BRIAN J;;ROSENBLUTH ROBERT F,,https://lens.org/177-424-147-413-204,Patent Application,no,0,0,23,23,0,A61B17/12022;;A61B17/1214;;A61B17/1215;;A61B17/12163;;A61B17/1219;;A61B2017/00477;;A61B2017/00535;;A61B2017/00539;;A61B2017/00867;;A61B2017/1205;;A61B2017/12054;;A61B17/1214;;A61B2017/00477;;A61B2017/1205;;A61B17/1215;;A61B2017/00867;;A61B17/12163;;A61B17/12022;;A61B17/1219;;A61B2017/00535;;A61B2017/12054;;A61B2017/00539,A61B17/00;;A61B17/12;;A61F2/06,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The deployment tube includes a distal section terminating in an open distal end, with a lumen defined between the proximal and distal ends. A retention sleeve is fixed around the distal section and includes a distal extension extending a short distance past the distal end of the deployment tube. The emovascular device is attached to the distal end of the deployment robe during the manufacturing process by fixing the retention sleeve around the coupling element, so that the coupling element is releasably held within the distal extension of the deployment tube. In use, the deployment mbe, with the implant attached to its distal end, is passed though a microcatheter to a target vascular site until the endovascular device is deployed within the site. To detach the endovascular device from the deployment tube a biocompatible liquid is injected through the lumen of the deployment tube so as to apply pressure to the upstream side of the coupling element, which is thus pushed out of the retention sleeve by the fluid pressure, thereby detaching the endovascular device from the deployment tube. The coupling element may be a solid ""plug"" of polymeric material or metal, or it may be formed of a hydrophilic polymer that softens and becomes somewhat lubricious when contacted by the injected liquid. With the latter type of material, the hydration of the hydrophilic material results in physical changes that reduce the adhesion between the coupling element and the sleeve. Alternatively, the coupling element can be made principally of a non-hydrophilic material, with a hydrophilic coating.",MICROVENTION INC,FERRERA DAVID A;;GREENE GEORGE R;;COX BRIAN J;;ROSENBLUTH ROBERT F,,https://lens.org/082-336-739-971-125,Granted Patent,no,0,0,23,23,0,A61B17/12022;;A61B17/1214;;A61B17/1215;;A61B17/12163;;A61B17/1219;;A61B2017/00477;;A61B2017/00535;;A61B2017/00539;;A61B2017/00867;;A61B2017/1205;;A61B2017/12054;;A61B17/1214;;A61B2017/00477;;A61B2017/1205;;A61B17/1215;;A61B2017/00867;;A61B17/12163;;A61B17/12022;;A61B17/1219;;A61B2017/00535;;A61B2017/12054;;A61B2017/00539,A61B17/00;;A61B17/12;;A61F2/06,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The deployment tube includes a distal section terminating in an open distal end, with a lumen defined between the proximal and distal ends. A retention sleeve is fixed around the distal section and includes a distal extension extending a short distance past the distal end of the deployment tube. The emovascular device is attached to the distal end of the deployment robe during the manufacturing process by fixing the retention sleeve around the coupling element, so that the coupling element is releasably held within the distal extension of the deployment tube. In use, the deployment mbe, with the implant attached to its distal end, is passed though a microcatheter to a target vascular site until the endovascular device is deployed within the site. To detach the endovascular device from the deployment tube a biocompatible liquid is injected through the lumen of the deployment tube so as to apply pressure to the upstream side of the coupling element, which is thus pushed out of the retention sleeve by the fluid pressure, thereby detaching the endovascular device from the deployment tube. The coupling element may be a solid ""plug"" of polymeric material or metal, or it may be formed of a hydrophilic polymer that softens and becomes somewhat lubricious when contacted by the injected liquid. With the latter type of material, the hydration of the hydrophilic material results in physical changes that reduce the adhesion between the coupling element and the sleeve.

The apparatus comprises an expandable dilation catheter and preferably an axially elongate sheath, adapted for transurethral insertion via the external opening of the urethra. The sheath is ellipsoid in cross-section, and provides an initial path through which the catheter and a standard cystoscope lens is guided. The dilation catheter or the sheath are provided with a non-radiological locating means for positioning the dilation portion of the catheter with respect to an anatomical landmark. Once the catheter has been properly positioned with respect to both the bladder neck and the sphincter, the dilation balloon may be inflated to force open the affected prostatic urethra and eliminate the obstruction.",ROSENBLUTH ROBERT F;;LENKER JAY A;;GREENE GEORGE R;;CALVARESE BARRY M,ROSENBLUTH ROBERT F;;LENKER JAY A;;GREENE GEORGE R;;CALVARESE BARRY M,BOSTON SCIENTIFIC SCIMED INC (1997-12-15);;BOSTON SCIENTIFIC TECHNOLOGY INC (1995-07-01);;BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION (1993-08-05),https://lens.org/087-912-316-354-517,Granted Patent,yes,95,244,1,63,0,A61F2/958;;A61F2002/30187;;A61F2002/9583;;A61F2230/0034;;A61K51/0485;;A61K51/1206;;A61K2121/00;;A61K2123/00;;A61M25/1011;;A61M29/02;;A61M2025/0004;;A61M2025/0008;;A61M2025/1072;;G01N33/57423;;A61K51/1206;;A61F2230/0034;;A61F2/958;;G01N33/57423;;A61M2025/1072;;A61K51/0485;;A61K2123/00;;A61F2002/30187;;A61M25/1011;;A61M2025/0008;;A61F2002/9583;;A61K2121/00;;A61M2025/0004;;A61M29/02,A61F2/00;;A61F2/06;;A61F2/84;;A61F2/90;;A61K49/00;;A61K51/04;;A61K51/12;;A61M25/10;;A61M29/02;;G01N33/574,606/192;;604/96;;604/104;;604/170;;128/4;;128/662.06,11,8,001-645-741-869-868;;033-841-472-207-370;;106-472-004-840-373;;070-194-000-631-361;;030-555-366-735-608;;022-634-418-273-43X;;046-377-466-142-289;;071-186-598-617-711,10.1159/000277130;;13337999;;10.1148/radiology.152.3.6205416;;6205416;;10.1007/978-1-4612-5476-8;;10.1148/radiology.160.3.2942964;;2942964;;10.1148/radiology.156.1.3159043;;3159043;;10.1159/000279359;;13731091;;10.1159/000277520;;10.1148/radiology.156.1.4001423;;4001423,"W.

The deployment tube includes a distal section terminating in an open distal end, with a lumen defined between the proximal and distal ends. A retention sleeve is fixed around the distal section and includes a distal extension extending a short distance past the distal end of the deployment tube. The emovascular device is attached to the distal end of the deployment robe during the manufacturing process by fixing the retention sleeve around the coupling element, so that the coupling element is releasably held within the distal extension of the deployment tube. In use, the deployment mbe, with the implant attached to its distal end, is passed though a microcatheter to a target vascular site until the endovascular device is deployed within the site. To detach the endovascular device from the deployment tube a biocompatible liquid is injected through the lumen of the deployment tube so as to apply pressure to the upstream side of the coupling element, which is thus pushed out of the retention sleeve by the fluid pressure, thereby detaching the endovascular device from the deployment tube. The coupling element may be a solid ""plug"" of polymeric material or metal, or it may be formed of a hydrophilic polymer that softens and becomes somewhat lubricious when contacted by the injected liquid. With the latter type of material, the hydration of the hydrophilic material results in physical changes that reduce the adhesion between the coupling element and the sleeve. Alternatively, the coupling element can be made principally of a non-hydrophilic material, with a hydrophilic coating.",MICROVENTION INC,FERRERA DAVID A;;GREENE GEORGE R JR;;COX BRIAN J;;ROSENBLUTH ROBERT F,,https://lens.org/112-282-779-088-025,Granted Patent,yes,7,1,23,23,0,A61B17/12022;;A61B17/1214;;A61B17/1215;;A61B17/12163;;A61B17/1219;;A61B2017/00477;;A61B2017/00535;;A61B2017/00539;;A61B2017/00867;;A61B2017/1205;;A61B2017/12054;;A61B17/1214;;A61B2017/00477;;A61B2017/1205;;A61B17/1215;;A61B2017/00867;;A61B17/12163;;A61B17/12022;;A61B17/1219;;A61B2017/00535;;A61B2017/12054;;A61B2017/00539,A61B17/00;;A61B17/12;;A61F2/06,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A vaso-occlusive device includes a microcoil formed into a minimum energy state secondary configuration comprising a plurality of curved segments, each defining a discrete axis, whereby the device, in its minimum energy state configuration, defines multiple axes. In a preferred embodiment, the minimum energy state secondary configuration comprises a plurality of tangentially-interconnected, substantially circular loops defining a plurality of discrete axes. In an alternative embodiment, the minimum energy state secondary configuration defines a wave-form like structure comprising a longitudinal array of laterally-alternating open loops defining a plurality of separate axes. In either embodiment, the device, in its minimum energy state secondary configuration, has a dimension that is substantially larger than the largest dimension of the vascular site in which the device is to be deployed. Thus, when the device is deployed in an aneurysm, the confinement of the device within the aneurysm causes the device to assume a three-dimensional configuration that has a higher energy state than the minimum energy state. Because the minimum energy state of the device is larger (in at least one dimension) than the aneurysm, the deployed device is constrained by its intimate contact with the walls of the aneurysm from returning to its minimum energy state configuration. Therefore, the device still engages the surrounding aneurysm wall surface, thereby minimizing shifting or tumbling due to blood flow dynamics. Furthermore, the minimum energy state secondary configuration (to which the device attempts to revert) is not one that is conducive to coin stacking, thereby minimizing the degree of compaction that is experienced.

   An embolization device for occluding a body cavity includes one or more elongated, expansible, hydrophilic embolizing elements non-releasably carried along the length of an elongated filamentous carrier that is preferably made of a very thin, highly flexible filament or microcoil of nickel/titanium alloy. At least one expansile embolizing element is non-releasably attached to the carrier. A first embodiment includes a plurality of embolizing elements fixed to the carrier at spaced-apart intervals along its length. In second, third and fourth embodiments, an elongate, continuous, coaxial embolizing element is non-releasably fixed to the exterior surface of the carrier, extending along a substantial portion of the length of the carrier proximally from a distal tip, and optionally includes a lumenal reservoir for delivery of therapeutic agents. Exemplary methods for making these devices include skewering and molding the embolizing elements. In any of the embodiments, the embolizing elements may be made of a hydrophilic, macroporous, polymeric, hydrogel foam material. In the second, third and fourth embodiments, the elongate embolizing element is preferably made of a porous, environmentally-sensitive, expansile hydrogel, which can optionally be made biodegradable and/or bioresorbable, having a rate of expansion that changes in response to a change in an environmental parameter, such as the pH or temperature of the environment.

The deployment tube includes a distal section terminating in an open distal end, with a lumen defined between the proximal and distal ends. A retention sleeve is fixed around the distal section and includes a distal extension extending a short distance past the distal end of the deployment tube. The emovascular device is attached to the distal end of the deployment robe during the manufacturing process by fixing the retention sleeve around the coupling element, so that the coupling element is releasably held within the distal extension of the deployment tube. In use, the deployment mbe, with the implant attached to its distal end, is passed though a microcatheter to a target vascular site until the endovascular device is deployed within the site. To detach the endovascular device from the deployment tube a biocompatible liquid is injected through the lumen of the deployment tube so as to apply pressure to the upstream side of the coupling element, which is thus pushed out of the retention sleeve by the fluid pressure, thereby detaching the endovascular device from the deployment tube. The coupling element may be a solid ""plug"" of polymeric material or metal, or it may be formed of a hydrophilic polymer that softens and becomes somewhat lubricious when contacted by the injected liquid. With the latter type of material, the hydration of the hydrophilic material results in physical changes that reduce the adhesion between the coupling element and the sleeve. Alternatively, the coupling element can be made principally of a non-hydrophilic material, with a hydrophilic coating.",MICROVENTION INC,FERRERA DAVID A;;GREENE GEORGE R JR;;COX BRIAN J;;ROSENBLUTH ROBERT F,,https://lens.org/035-547-422-846-890,Granted Patent,no,0,0,23,23,0,A61B17/12022;;A61B17/1214;;A61B17/1215;;A61B17/12163;;A61B17/1219;;A61B2017/00477;;A61B2017/00535;;A61B2017/00539;;A61B2017/00867;;A61B2017/1205;;A61B2017/12054;;A61B17/1214;;A61B2017/00477;;A61B2017/1205;;A61B17/1215;;A61B2017/00867;;A61B17/12163;;A61B17/12022;;A61B17/1219;;A61B2017/00535;;A61B2017/12054;;A61B2017/00539,A61B17/00;;A61B17/12;;A61F2/06,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   An access node that is deployable at a distance from a cable company head-end or a telephone company central office serves residential and business subscribers within a small geographical area. The access node provides interoperability between and across communications links and protocols, thereby providing a modular, configurable access point for both business and residential users that enables the service provider to tailor its services for each user in a cost-effective manner. The access node includes modular interfaces to multiple communications links and protocols on its network side and modular interfaces to multiple communications links and protocols on its user or access side. A switch/router connects the outputs of the two interfaces together and aggregates traffic to the network while simultaneously partitioning traffic to the users to the appropriate connections.

The deployment tube includes a distal section terminating in an open distal end, with a lumen defined between the proximal and distal ends. A retention sleeve is fixed around the distal section and includes a distal extension extending a short distance past the distal end of the deployment tube. The emovascular device is attached to the distal end of the deployment robe during the manufacturing process by fixing the retention sleeve around the coupling element, so that the coupling element is releasably held within the distal extension of the deployment tube. In use, the deployment mbe, with the implant attached to its distal end, is passed though a microcatheter to a target vascular site until the endovascular device is deployed within the site. To detach the endovascular device from the deployment tube a biocompatible liquid is injected through the lumen of the deployment tube so as to apply pressure to the upstream side of the coupling element, which is thus pushed out of the retention sleeve by the fluid pressure, thereby detaching the endovascular device from the deployment tube. The coupling element may be a solid ""plug"" of polymeric material or metal, or it may be formed of a hydrophilic polymer that softens and becomes somewhat lubricious when contacted by the injected liquid. With the latter type of material, the hydration of the hydrophilic material results in physical changes that reduce the adhesion between the coupling element and the sleeve. Alternatively, the coupling element can be made principally of a non-hydrophilic material, with a hydrophilic coating.",MICROVENTION INC,FERRERA DAVID A;;GREENE GEORGE R JR;;COX BRIAN J;;ROSENBLUTH ROBERT F,,https://lens.org/046-757-510-369-531,Patent Application,yes,0,0,23,23,0,A61B17/12022;;A61B17/1214;;A61B17/1215;;A61B17/12163;;A61B17/1219;;A61B2017/00477;;A61B2017/00535;;A61B2017/00539;;A61B2017/00867;;A61B2017/1205;;A61B2017/12054;;A61B17/1214;;A61B2017/00477;;A61B2017/1205;;A61B17/1215;;A61B2017/00867;;A61B17/12163;;A61B17/12022;;A61B17/1219;;A61B2017/00535;;A61B2017/12054;;A61B2017/00539,A61B17/00;;A61B17/12;;A61F2/06,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A mechanism for the deployment of a filamentous endovascular device includes a flexible deployment tube having an open proximal end, and a coupling element attached to the proximal end of the endovascular device. The deployment tube includes a distal section terminating in an open distal end, with a lumen defined between the proximal and distal ends. A retention sleeve is fixed around the distal section and includes a distal extension extending a short distance past the distal end of the deployment tube. The endovascular device is attached to the distal end of the deployment tube by fixing the retention sleeve around the coupling element, so that the coupling element is releasably held within the distal extension of the deployment tube. In use, the deployment tube, with the implant attached to its distal end, is passed intravascularly through a microcatheter to a target vascular site until the endovascular device is located within the site. To detach the endovascular device from the deployment tube, a liquid is injected through the lumen of the deployment tube so as to apply pressure to the upstream side of the coupling element, which is thus pushed out of the retention sleeve by the fluid pressure. The coupling element may include an internal or peripheral purge passage that allows air to be purged from the microcatheter prior to the intravascular passage of the endovascular device.

The deployment tube includes a distal section terminating in an open distal end, with a lumen defined between the proximal and distal ends. A retention sleeve is fixed around the distal section and includes a distal extension extending a short distance past the distal end of the deployment tube. The emovascular device is attached to the distal end of the deployment robe during the manufacturing process by fixing the retention sleeve around the coupling element, so that the coupling element is releasably held within the distal extension of the deployment tube. In use, the deployment mbe, with the implant attached to its distal end, is passed though a microcatheter to a target vascular site until the endovascular device is deployed within the site. To detach the endovascular device from the deployment tube a biocompatible liquid is injected through the lumen of the deployment tube so as to apply pressure to the upstream side of the coupling element, which is thus pushed out of the retention sleeve by the fluid pressure, thereby detaching the endovascular device from the deployment tube. The coupling element may be a solid ""plug"" of polymeric material or metal, or it may be formed of a hydrophilic polymer that softens and becomes somewhat lubricious when contacted by the injected liquid. With the latter type of material, the hydration of the hydrophilic material results in physical changes that reduce the adhesion between the coupling element and the sleeve. Alternatively, the coupling element can be made principally of a non-hydrophilic material, with a hydrophilic coating.",MICROVENTION INC,COX BRIAN J;;FERRERA DAVID A;;ROSENBLUTH ROBERT F;;GREENE GEORGE R JR,,https://lens.org/097-920-354-307-319,Granted Patent,no,3,0,23,23,0,A61B17/12022;;A61B17/1214;;A61B17/1215;;A61B17/12163;;A61B17/1219;;A61B2017/00477;;A61B2017/00535;;A61B2017/00539;;A61B2017/00867;;A61B2017/1205;;A61B2017/12054;;A61B17/1214;;A61B2017/00477;;A61B2017/1205;;A61B17/1215;;A61B2017/00867;;A61B17/12163;;A61B17/12022;;A61B17/1219;;A61B2017/00535;;A61B2017/12054;;A61B2017/00539,A61B17/00;;A61B17/12;;A61F2/06,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The deployment tube includes a distal section terminating in an open distal end, with a lumen defined between the proximal and distal ends. A retention sleeve is fixed around the distal section and includes a distal extension extending a short distance past the distal end of the deployment tube. The emovascular device is attached to the distal end of the deployment robe during the manufacturing process by fixing the retention sleeve around the coupling element, so that the coupling element is releasably held within the distal extension of the deployment tube. In use, the deployment mbe, with the implant attached to its distal end, is passed though a microcatheter to a target vascular site until the endovascular device is deployed within the site. To detach the endovascular device from the deployment tube a biocompatible liquid is injected through the lumen of the deployment tube so as to apply pressure to the upstream side of the coupling element, which is thus pushed out of the retention sleeve by the fluid pressure, thereby detaching the endovascular device from the deployment tube. The coupling element may be a solid ""plug"" of polymeric material or metal, or it may be formed of a hydrophilic polymer that softens and becomes somewhat lubricious when contacted by the injected liquid. With the latter type of material, the hydration of the hydrophilic material results in physical changes that reduce the adhesion between the coupling element and the sleeve. Alternatively, the coupling element can be made principally of a non-hydrophilic material, with a hydrophilic coating.

    A vaso-occlusive device includes a microcoil formed into a minimum energy state secondary configuration comprising a plurality of curved segments, each defining a discrete axis, whereby the device, in its minimum energy state configuration, defines multiple axes. In a preferred embodiment, the minimum energy state secondary configuration comprises a plurality of tangentially-interconnected, substantially circular loops defining a plurality of discrete axes. In an alternative embodiment, the minimum energy state secondary configuration defines a wave-form like structure comprising a longitudinal array of laterally-alternating open loops defining a plurality of separate axes. In either embodiment, the device, in its minimum energy state secondary configuration, has a dimension that is substantially larger than the largest dimension of the vascular site in which the device is to be deployed. Thus, when the device is deployed in an aneurysm, the confinement of the device within the aneurysm causes the device to assume a three-dimensional configuration that has a higher energy state than the minimum energy state. Because the minimum energy state of the device is larger (in at least one dimension) than the aneurysm, the deployed device is constrained by its intimate contact with the walls of the aneurysm from returning to its minimum energy state configuration. Therefore, the device still engages the surrounding aneurysm wall surface, thereby minimizing shifting or tumbling due to blood flow dynamics. Furthermore, the minimum energy state secondary configuration (to which the device attempts to revert) is not one that is conducive to coin stacking, thereby minimizing the degree of compaction that is experienced.

In a preferred embodiment, the minimum energy state secondary configuration comprises a plurality of tangentially-interconnected, substantially circular loops defining a plurality of discrete axes. In an alternative embodiment, the minimum energy state secondary configuration defines a wave-form like structure comprising a longitudinal array of laterally-alternating open loops defining a plurality of separate axes. In either embodiment, the device, in its minimum energy state secondary configuration, has a dimension that is substantially larger than the largest dimension of the vascular site in which the device is to be deployed. Thus, when the device is deployed in an aneurysm, the confinement of the device within the aneurysm causes the device to assume a three-dimensional configuration that has a higher energy state than the minimum energy state. Because the minimum energy state of the device is larger (in at least one dimension) than the aneurysm, the deployed device is constrained by its intimate contact with the walls of the aneurysm from returning to its minimum energy state configuration. Therefore, the device still engages the surrounding aneurysm wall surface, thereby minimizing shifting or tumbling due to blood flow dynamics. Furthermore, the minimum energy state secondary configuration (to which the device attempts to revert) is not one that is conducive to “coin stacking”, thereby minimizing the degree of compaction that is experienced.",MICROVENTION INC,SCHAEFER DEAN;;ALMAZAN HORACIO;;FERRERA DAVID A;;COX BRIAN J;;GREENE JR GEORGE R,,https://lens.org/051-157-765-827-25X,Granted Patent,yes,72,20,3,3,0,A61B17/12022;;A61B17/12022;;A61B17/12113;;A61B17/12113;;A61B17/12145;;A61B17/12145,A61M29/00;;A61B17/12,606/200,7,7,017-434-135-875-193;;068-510-904-430-837;;095-236-064-606-94X;;042-516-545-577-936;;040-088-143-944-050;;014-901-887-949-598;;021-961-614-703-240,50746;;10.2214/ajr.124.3.428;;10.2214/ajr.129.5.795;;410242;;10.1148/132.2.301;;461784;;10.1148/radiology.155.2.3983407;;3983407;;10.1097/00006123-199910000-00070;;10515501;;10.1097/00006123-199910000-00069;;pmc3679578;;10.1177/159101990000600106;;20667181;;pmc8174921;;10954285,"Gianturco, M.D. et al.; ""Mechanical Devices for Arterial Occlusion"" Jul. 1975, vol. 124, No. 3., pp. 428-435.;;Anderson, James et al.; ""Transcatheter Intravascular Coil Occlusion . . .

Various embodiments of the lamp use electrodes adjacent the envelope to couple the excitation signal thereto with the face of the electrodes shaped to complement the shape of the exterior surface of the envelope. Two shapes discussed are spherical and cylindrical. To minimize filamentary discharges each envelope may include an elongated stem affixed to the exterior thereof whereby a rotational subsystem spins the envelope. In yet another embodiment the envelope has a Dewar configuration with two electrodes, one positioned near the external curved side surface of the body, and a second to the inner surface of the hole through the envelope. Further, the envelope may contain a backfill of a selected inert gas to assist in the excitation of lamp with that backfill at a pressure of less than 1 atmosphere, wherein the backfill pressure is directly related to the increase or decrease of peak output and inversely related to the increase and decrease of the emitted spectrum from the envelope.

The lamp utilizes a signal source that generates an excitation signal that is externally coupled to the exterior surface of the envelope to excite the enclosed sulfur containing substance. Various embodiments of the lamp use electrodes adjacent the envelope to couple the excitation signal thereto with the face of the electrodes shaped to complement the shape of the exterior surface of the envelope. Two shapes discussed are spherical and cylindrical. To minimize filamentary discharges each envelope may include an elongated stem affixed to the exterior thereof whereby a rotational subsystem spins the envelope. In yet another embodiment the envelope has a Dewar configuration with two electrodes, one positioned near the external curved side surface of the body, and a second to the inner surface of the hole through the envelope. Further, the envelope may contain a backfill of a selected inert gas to assist in the excitation of lamp with that backfill at a pressure of less than 1 atmosphere, wherein the backfill pressure is directly related to the increase or decrease of peak output and inversely related to the increase and decrease of the emitted spectrum from the envelope. The emitting fill can be less than 6 mg/cc, or at least 2 mg/cc of the envelope of a sulfur containing substance.",GABOR; GEORGE;;ORR; THOMAS ROBERT;;GREENE; CHARLES MAURICE;;CRAWFORD; DOUGLAS GORDON;;BERMAN; SAMUEL MAURICE,GABOR GEORGE;;ORR THOMAS ROBERT;;GREENE CHARLES MAURICE;;CRAWFORD DOUGLAS GORDON;;BERMAN SAMUEL MAURICE,,https://lens.org/198-173-437-372-015,Granted Patent,yes,32,10,7,7,0,H05B41/24;;H05B41/24,H05B41/24,315/39;;315/248;;315/344,6,4,028-651-580-306-802;;004-704-199-313-312;;095-319-941-513-221;;040-611-448-061-842,10.1063/1.440335;;20234572;;10.1364/ao.19.003113;;10.1109/jqe.1985.1072752;;10.1063/1.101404,"by R.W.B.

In a preferred embodiment, the secondary configuration-comprises a plurality of interconnected closed loops defining a plurality of discrete axes. In a second embodiment, the secondary configuration defines a wave-form like structure comprising an array of laterally-alternating open loops defining a plurality of separate axes. In a third embodiment, the secondary configuration forms a series of tangential closed loops, wherein the entire structure subtends a first angle of arc, and wherein each adjacent pair of loops defines a second angle of arc. In a fourth embodiment, the secondary configuration forms a logarithmic spiral. In all embodiments, the device, in its secondary configuration, has a dimension that is substantially larger than the largest dimension of the vascular site i.e., aneurysm in which it is to be deployed. Thus, confinement of the device within an aneurysm causes it to assume a three-dimensional configuration with a higher energy state than the minimum energy state. Because the minimum energy state configuration of the device is larger in at least one dimension than the aneurysm, the deployed device is constrained by its contact with the walls of the aneurysm from returning to its minimum energy state configuration. The engagement of the device with the aneurysm wall minimizes shifting or tumbling due to blood flow. Furthermore, the secondary configuration is not conducive to ""coin stacking,"" thereby minimizing the compaction experienced.

   A vaso-occlusive device includes a microcoil formed into a minimum energy state secondary configuration comprising a plurality of curved segments, each defining a discrete axis, whereby the device, in its minimum energy state configuration, defines multiple axes. In a preferred embodiment, the secondary configuration-comprises a plurality of interconnected closed loops defining a plurality of discrete axes. In a second embodiment, the secondary configuration defines a wave-form like structure comprising an array of laterally-alternating open loops defining a plurality of separate axes. In a third embodiment, the secondary configuration forms a series of tangential closed loops, wherein the entire structure subtends a first angle of arc, and wherein each adjacent pair of loops defines a second angle of arc. In a fourth embodiment, the secondary configuration forms a logarithmic spiral. In all embodiments, the device, in its secondary configuration, has a dimension that is substantially larger than the largest dimension of the vascular site (i.e., aneurysm) in which it is to be deployed. Thus, confinement of the device within an aneurysm causes it to assume a three-dimensional configuration with a higher energy state than the minimum energy state. Because the minimum energy state configuration of the device is larger (in at least one dimension) than the aneurysm, the deployed device is constrained by its contact with the walls of the aneurysm from returning to its minimum energy state configuration. The engagement of the device with the aneurysm wall minimizes shifting or tumbling due to blood flow. Furthermore, the secondary configuration is not conducive to coin stacking, thereby minimizing the compaction experienced.

In a preferred embodiment, the secondary configuration-comprises a plurality of interconnected closed loops defining a plurality of discrete axes. In a second embodiment, the secondary configuration defines a wave-form like structure comprising an array of laterally-alternating open loops defining a plurality of separate axes.

In all embodiments, the device, in its secondary configuration, has a dimension that is substantially larger than the largest dimension of the vascular site i.e., aneurysm in which it is to be deployed. Thus, confinement of the device within an aneurysm causes it to assume a three-dimensional configuration with a higher energy state than the minimum energy state. Because the minimum energy state configuration of the device is larger in at least one dimension than the aneurysm, the deployed device is constrained by its contact with the walls of the aneurysm from returning to its minimum energy state configuration. The engagement of the device with the aneurysm wall minimizes shifting or tumbling due to blood flow. Furthermore, the secondary configuration is not conducive to ""coin stacking,"" thereby minimizing the compaction experienced.

The device, in its secondary cofiguration, has a dimension that is substantially larger than the largest dimension of the vascular site in which it is to be deployed. Thus, confinement of the device within the site causes it to assume a configuration with a higher energy state than the minimum energy state.

This invention is particularly useable for percutaneous removal of thromboemboli or other obstructive matter from small blood vessels of the brain, during an evolving stroke or period of cerebral ischemia. In some embodiments, the embolectomy catheters of this invention are advanceable with or over a guidewire which has been pre-inserted through or around the clot. Also, in some embodiments, the embolectomy catheters include clot removal devices which are deployable from the catheter after the catheter has been advanced at least partially through the clot. The clot removal device may include a deployable wire nest that is designed to prevent a blood clot from passing therethrough. The delivery catheter may include telescoping inner and outer tubes, with the clot removal device being radially constrained by the outer tube. Retraction of the outer tube removes the constraint on the clot removal device and permits it to expand to its deployed configuration. An infusion guidewire is particularly useful in conjunction with the embolectomy catheter, and permits infusion of medicaments or visualization fluids distal to the clot.",MICROVENTION INC,ROSENBLUTH ROBERT F;;GREENE JR GEORGE R;;COX BRIAN J;;STERNWEILER THOMAS S;;CHOW SEAN L;;MONETTI RICHARD R;;HALVERSON TERESA L;;WALKER MARICELA D;;PECOR ROBERT,,https://lens.org/032-014-933-046-544,Patent Application,yes,0,25,34,34,0,A61B17/135;;A61B17/221;;A61B2017/22034;;A61B2017/22044;;A61B2017/22077;;A61B2017/22084;;A61B2017/22094;;A61B2017/2212;;A61B2017/320716;;A61M2025/0183;;A61F2002/016;;A61F2002/018;;A61F2230/008;;A61F2230/0091;;A61M2025/0042;;A61B17/22032;;A61B17/221;;A61B2017/22034;;A61B2017/22044;;A61B2017/22077;;A61B2017/22094;;A61B2017/2212;;A61B2017/22084;;A61B2017/320716;;A61M2025/0183;;A61B17/135;;A61F2002/018;;A61F2002/016;;A61F2230/008;;A61F2230/0091;;A61M2025/0042;;A61B17/22032,A61B17/22;;A61B17/221;;A61F2/958,604/509;;606/194,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
