The apparatus is a surgical attachment device that comprises a member (21) (preferably moulded plastic) having at least one opening (22) adjacent a first surface (29a) thereof. A first portion (22a) of each opening is designed to slidably secure the tubes, hoses or cables. A second portion (25) of each opening immediately adjacent the first surface is smaller than the dimension of the first portion. The first portion of each opening tapers from a narrow dimension at the centre of the member to a wide dimension at opposite ends of the member. Each opening has a plurality of inwardly projecting tapered ribs (27) disposed around its internal periphery that taper from their narrowest dimension at the centre of the opening to their widest dimension at the ends of each opening. The inwardmost edges of the plurality of tapered ribs have a dimension nominally equal to or narrower than the narrowest dimension of the tapered opening. The tapered ribs assist in securing the tubes, hoses or cables in the opening and prevent unwanted sliding thereof. The inwardmost edges of the ribs contact the tubes, hoses or cables when they are inserted in the opening. One pair of ribs or projections (26) are larger than the others and are initially encountered when a hose or tube is pressed into the first portion of the opening. This configuration secures the various hoses and tubes, and the like, within the second portion of the opening and prevents their inadvertent pull-out. An adhesive layer (28) is disposed on a second external surface (29b) of the member for securing it to a surgical drape during an operation. The surgical attachment device may be flexible or deformable between the first and second portions of each opening to permit passage of nonflexible tubes, hoses or cables through the second portion of the opening. This may be achieved by adding additional lower slots separated from selected openings by hinge areas that provide for easy flexing of the member at the openings to permit insertion of the tubes, hose, or cables therein. The flexible portion comprises one or more living hinge areas that flex to open each of the openings.",DOBKIN WILLIAM R,DOBKIN WILLIAM R,,https://lens.org/195-961-995-233-376,Search Report,yes,7,0,6,8,0,A61M25/02;;A61B17/00;;A61B2046/234;;A61M2025/024,A61B19/00;;A61B17/00;;A61B46/23;;A61M25/02;;A61M39/02,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The apparatus is a surgical attachment device that includes a slightly flexible member (flexible plastic, for example) having one or more grooves formed therein. A first portion or tunnel of each groove is dimensioned to slidably secure the respective tube, hose, or cable. A second portion of each groove, superficial to the first portion, is slightly narrower than the first portion of each groove. This configuration allows for insertion of the tube, hose, or cable into the tunnels, which is done by transiently deforming the narrower portion of the groove, deforming the tube, hose, or cable, or both, and pushing the tube, hose, or cable into the tunnel. A second embodiment of the apparatus include selected additional lower grooves separated from the grooves by hinge areas that permit easy flexing of the flexible member and opening of the grooves to permit insertion of the tubes, hose, or cables. Once the tube, hose, or cable is within its tunnel, the narrower portion of the groove restricts unintended pull-out of the tube, hose, or cable from the attachment device. The length of the tunnels and the relative dimensions of the tube/hose/cable to their tunnels determines the drag coefficient as they are pulled through the tunnels. These proportions are designed to provide for intentional sliding through the tunnels, and also provide sufficient friction to resist most unwanted motion. Each groove may be flared at their ends. In the case of the suction tube, this flaring allows the tube to undergo angular movement without compromising the internal geometry of the tube. An adhesive layer is disposed on the second surface of the flexible member so that it may be secured during an operation.",DOBKIN; WILLIAM R.,DOBKIN WILLIAM R,,https://lens.org/074-784-724-111-690,Granted Patent,yes,8,87,2,8,0,A61B17/00;;A61M25/02;;A61M2025/024;;A61B2046/234;;A61M25/02;;A61B17/00;;A61M2025/024;;A61B2046/234,A61B17/00;;A61B46/23;;A61M25/02,604/180;;604/174,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The surgical attachment device may be flexible or deformable between the first and second portions of each opening to permit passage of nonflexible tubes, hoses or cables through the second portion of the opening. This may be achieved by adding additional lower slots separated from selected openings by hinge areas that provide for easy flexing of the member at the openings to permit insertion of the tubes, hose, or cables therein. The flexible portion comprises one or more living hinge areas that flex to open each of the openings.",DOBKIN; WILLIAM R.,DOBKIN WILLIAM R,,https://lens.org/119-425-696-742-490,Granted Patent,yes,3,23,2,8,0,A61B17/00;;A61M25/02;;A61M2025/024;;A61B2046/234;;A61M25/02;;A61B17/00;;A61M2025/024;;A61B2046/234,A61B17/00;;A61B46/23;;A61M25/02,604/174;;604/180,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A medical self-screening system and method that allows rapid triage of patient medical problems. An exemplary system includes a computer having a selection device, a display, and an optional printer. A storage device containing one or more databases is coupled to the computer. Triage software runs on the computer that generates and displays a symptom screen display comprising a pictorial image of the body containing selectable regions that may be affected by patient symptoms. The patient selects a generally affected area or region on the displayed anatomical picture of the body using the selection device. Then the triage software displays a subsequent anatomical picture which is an enlarged more detailed view of the affected area. The patient selects a more specific region of the affected area shown in the enlarged view. The triage software then displays symptom selection screens that permit comparison of groups of symptoms experienced by the patient. The selected symptoms and data derived from the one or more databases are processed to determine an appropriate course of action that should be taken by the patient. The appropriate course of action is displayed to the patient.

The collector of the NPN transistor is connected to the input terminal, and the emitter of the NPN transistor is connected to the substrate. A resistor interconnects the base and the emitter. Advantageously, the P-doped base can abut the P-doped isolation region forming the tub, and the P-doped isolation region can interconnect the emitter to the substrate. Below BV.sub.CES the clamp will look like an open circuit, and above BV.sub.CES the transistor will start conducting current. The transistor will break down collector to base. Conduction of the transistor causes a voltage drop across the base-emitter junction, and when this voltage drop exceeds the base-emitter forward voltage the transistor will turn on. Once the transistor is turned on and current starts flowing in the emitter, avalanche effects will cause the breakdown voltage to snap back to BV.sub.CEO and remain there until the emitter current drops below some low level, which will be at the end of the electrostatic discharge pulse. In the negative direction the tub to substrate diode provides an effective clamp which will clamp the voltage to a low value and limit the power dissipation in the junction. Alternatively, a bidirectional clamp can be provided in which a second NPN transistor is fabricated in the tub with the emitter of the second transistor connected to the input terminal and the collectors of the two transistors being interconnected by the N-doped epitaxial layer of the tub.
