    A concealed apparatus for hands free breast milk pumping and storage includes one or more low profile nipple caps held in place beneath a support brassiere. The system permits concealed, hands free breast pumping in a public environment without any remarkable change in the user's visible appearance. Milk is expressed from the breasts through novel, low profile nipple caps linked to a reservoir via a milk storage conduit. A vacuum is applied to the storage reservoir by any suitable means such as an electric or manual vacuum pump. Suction is thus conveyed through related system components to express milk from the breasts and draw it into the storage reservoir, while being essentially unobserved by others.

Multiplex pulse signalling. GENERAL ELECTRIC CO., Ltd. Sept. 4, 1952 [Sept. 15, 1951], No. 21560/51. Addition to 663,785. Class 40 (5) The multichannel pulse communication system of the parent Specification is modified in respect of the duration of certain pulses and the circuits for pulse amplitude modulation, time modulation and distribution. In the 26-channel system described, the waveform generator WG, Fig. 1, produces a train of negative pulses, at channel recurrence frequency and of duration slightly greater than a channel interval, which is fed to the delay line distributer D. Tapping DO on the line D controls a synchronizing signal generator SG which produces a double pulse which is fed to the output amplifier PA in the twenty-fifth channel interval. The other tappings D1 ... D24 feed individual circuits AM1 ... AM24 in which the pulse amplitude is modulated by individual signal sources SIG1 ... SIG24. The outputs of circuits AM1 ... AM24 are combined in four groups 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 ; 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 12; 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23 and 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, for application respectively to the pulse time modulators PTMI ... PTMIV, the outputs of which are combined and fed to the amplifier PA. The modulators are supplied with sawtooth waves from generators STGI ... STGIV respectively those for the odd channels being controlled by a square wave of thirteen times the channel recurrence frequency derived from output A of the wave generator WG while those for the even channels receive the same wave, but with a phase-shift of 180 degrees, from an output B. The circuit of a pulse amplitude modulator such as AM1 comprises a valve 102, Fig. 2, to the control grid of which is applied the modulating signal from source SIGI. Its cathode resistance 110 is common also to valve 111 to which is applied the negative-going pulse from D1, the tapping on delay line D, Fig. 1. Valve 111 is normally conducting, to bias the cathode of valve 102 to cut-off. The pulse from D1 reverses this condition and a corresponding negative amplitude-modulated pulse appears at the anode of valve 102, the anode load 113 being common to a group of modulators. The input signal excursions are limited by diodes 108, 109 suitably biased by the voltage-dividing network 103 ... 106. The circuit of a pulse time modulator such as PTM1, Fig. 1, comprises a pair of triodes 121, Fig. 3, to the left and right hand control grids of which are applied respectively, at terminals 120, 122, the negative going sawtooth wave from generator STGI, Fig. 1, and the amplitude-modulated positive-going pulses. The triodes have a common cathode resistor 124 and normally the left hand one is conducting and the right hand one non- conducting. This condition is reversed at a point on the sawtooth wave depending on the amplitude of the amplitude-modulated pulse and is restored at the sawtooth flyback, so that negative duration-modulated pulses appear at the right hand anode. These are squared and inverted by pentode 128 and applied to a critically-damped ringing circuit 129 to produce a pair of positive and negative differential pulses corresponding to the time-modulated and fixed leading and trailing edges of the duration-modulated pulses. The leading-edge pulses are selected by the biasedback valve 132 which provides the time-modulated pulses at terminal 133.",GEN ELECTRIC CO LTD,LITTLE JOHN GILBERT,,https://lens.org/010-173-335-250-502,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,4,0,H04J3/00,H04J3/00,H4M ML            ML;;H4M MTDX1         MTDX1-3,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In a preferred embodiment holders 113, 114 are supported by means of leaf or blade springs 130, 132 so that holders 113, 114 are restricted to horizontal and vertical reciprocating movement respectively. Holder 114 is mounted to be moved along the axis 112 by a piston-andcylinder unit 115. Components of simple harmonic reciprocating motion are applied to the holders 113, 114 from a rotary drive motor 116 via transmission means 136a, 136b, including variable-throw cranks 144a, 144b. An adjustment means (not shown) moves slide blocks 141a, 141b along the slots 140a, 140b of levers 138a, 138b, respectively, to any desired position and no motion is transmitted to the holders when the slide blocks are moved into alignment with pivotal axes 139a, 139b. In an alternative arrangement the leaf springs may be supported at both ends and the holders 113, 114 mounted midway between the supported ends. In another embodiment, support means, Fig. 2 (not shown), may comprise a body portion formed with a dove-tail section to slide in a correspondingly shaped slideway formed in a guide member. Fluid under pressure may be supplied to the slideway thereby providing hydrostatic suspension for the holder. In a further embodiment, Fig. 3, rectilinear reciprocating movement is transmitted to the workpiece 51 by a slide block 54 slidably mounted in a supporting frame 55. The spigots 57 cooperate with respective bores 56 in the slide block 54 and form a fluid-tight fit therein. Suitable sealing rings may be provided. Pistons 58 act within bores 59 which communicate directly with respective bores 56 which contain hydraulic fluid. Inlet and outlet ducts 60, 61 for circulating the hydraulic fluid are opened to the bores at the end of each stroke. The pistons having rollers are driven by respective eccentric elements 62 each comprising a cylindrical portion joined to another cylindrical portion offset from the axis of the first portion and being rotatable about one of the axes. The invention is further directed to several workpieces of a first set being welded to respective workpieces of a second set and reference is also made to opposite ends of an intermediate workpiece being joined concurrently to the ends of two terminal workpieces, and further to several workpieces being joined simultaneously to a large workpiece. In a modification of the apparatus of Fig. 6 two pistons are provided each with an extension of generally U-shape so that they may be driven from a common eccentric element.",JOHN THOMPSON PIPE WORK AND OR,SEARLE JOHN GILBERT,,https://lens.org/154-269-083-246-758,Granted Patent,no,0,9,1,1,0,B23K20/1205,B23K20/12,B3R R10           R15;;B3R R14           R15;;B3R R15           R15,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A piston (14) on a driven rod (13) is slidable in a hole in the dividing wall and supports a carrier (28) to which a first component (36) is secured. Tow additional rods (9 and 10) extend through the chambers. Enlarged portions (11) thereof extend through holes in end walls (4 and 5) of the chambers. The additional rods are caused to reciprocate with fixed amplitude by Scotch cranks (23 to 26, and 31) driven by a motor (30). The relative phases of the Scotch cranks can be varied by axial movement of a sleeve (35) which engages splined shafts of the cranks, one of sets of splines (35) being helical and the other straight. When the additional rods reciprocate in unison they cause local variations in the interior space of the chambers which cause reciprocation of the piston. The amplitude of reciprocation of the piston is less than that of the additional rods but the force exerted is greater. The first component is held in frictional contact with a stationery second component (37) so that frictional heat is generated between them. When the cranks are 180 DEG out of phase the piston ceases to move and the components become welded together. Reciprocation of the piston and associated parts is balanced by a balancer (2) somewhat similar to the reciprocator, while reciprocation of the additional rods and their extensions (16 and 17) in the balancer are balanced by pivoted counterweight (46).",ALLWOOD SEARLE & TIMNEY,SEARLE JOHN GILBERT,,https://lens.org/168-897-891-618-551,Granted Patent,no,0,0,14,14,0,B23K20/1205;;B23K20/1205,B23K20/12,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

As shown in Fig. 3 the workpiece holder 13 is connected to a piston- and-cylinder unit 15 energized pneumatically or hydraulically to urge together the end faces of the workpieces 10, 11. The holder 14 is driven with a translatory orbital motion from a motor 16. Eccentric elements in the form of crank discs 24, 25 convert the rotary motion of the motor 16 into the required translatory orbital motion. Crank-pins 26, 27 are adjustable in slots 24a, 25a to vary the eccentricity from zero to any predetermined value. In another embodiment, Fig. 4, the workpiece holders 113, 114 are supported by means of leaf or blade springs 130, 132 so that holder 113 is restricted to horizontal reciprocating movement and holder 114 to vertical movement. Holder 114 is mounted to be moved along the axis 112 by a piston-andcylinder unit 115. Components of simple harmonic reciprocating motion are applied to the holders 113, 114 from a rotary drive-motor 116 via transmission means 136a, 136b including variable throw cranks 144a, 144b. In an alternative arrangement the leaf-springs may be supported at both ends and the holders 113, 114 mounted midway between the supported ends. Yet another alternative support means, Fig. 5 (not shown), may comprise a body portion formed with a dove-tail section to slide in a correspondingly-shaped slideway formed in a guide member. Fluid under pressure may be supplied to the slideway thereby providing hydrostatic suspension for the holder. In a further embodiment, Fig. 6, rectilinear reciprocatory movement is transmitted to the workpiece 51 by a slide block 54 slidably mounted in a supporting frame 55. The spigots 57 co-operate with respective bores 56 in the slide block 54 and form a fluid-tight fit therein. Suitable sealing-rings may be provided. Pistons 58 act within bores 59 which communicate directly with respective bores 56 which contain hydraulic fluid. Inlet and outlet ducts 60, 61 for circulating the hydraulic fluid are opened to the bores at the end of each stroke. The pistons having rollers are driven by respective eccentric elements 62 each comprising a cylindrical portion joined to another cylindrical portion offset from the axis of the first portion and being rotatable about one of the axles. The invention is further directed to several workpieces of a first set being welded to respective workpieces of a second set and reference is also made to opposite ends of an intermediate workpiece being joined concurrently to the ends of two terminal workpieces, and further to several workpieces being joined simultaneously to a large workpiece. In a modification of the apparatus of Fig. 6, two pistons are provided each with an extension of generally U-shape so that they may be driven from a common eccentric element.",JOHN THOMPSON PIPE WORK AND OR,SEARLE JOHN GILBERT,,https://lens.org/176-351-185-329-408,Granted Patent,no,0,29,1,1,0,B23K20/1205,B23K20/12,B3R R10           R15;;B3R R14           R15;;B3R R15           R15,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A piston (14) on a driven rod (13) is slidable in a hole in the dividing wall and supports a carrier (28) to which a first component (36) is secured. Tow additional rods (9 and 10) extend through the chambers. Enlarged portions (11) thereof extend through holes in end walls (4 and 5) of the chambers. The additional rods are caused to reciprocate with fixed amplitude by Scotch cranks (23 to 26, and 31) driven by a motor (30). The relative phases of the Scotch cranks can be varied by axial movement of a sleeve (35) which engages splined shafts of the cranks, one of sets of splines (35) being helical and the other straight. When the additional rods reciprocate in unison they cause local variations in the interior space of the chambers which cause reciprocation of the piston. The amplitude of reciprocation of the piston is less than that of the additional rods but the force exerted is greater. The first component is held in frictional contact with a stationery second component (37) so that frictional heat is generated between them. When the cranks are 180 DEG out of phase the piston ceases to move and the components become welded together. Reciprocation of the piston and associated parts is balanced by a balancer (2) somewhat similar to the reciprocator, while reciprocation of the additional rods and their extensions (16 and 17) in the balancer are balanced by pivoted counterweight (46).",ALLWOOD SEARLE & TIMNEY,SEARLE JOHN GILBERT,,https://lens.org/051-441-514-875-466,Patent Application,no,0,2,14,14,0,B23K20/1205;;B23K20/1205,B23K20/12,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

This movement is derived from a follower coupled to a rotor which rotates about a given axis but has a longitudinal axis which is inclined to and intersects the rotational axis. The longitudinal axis thus generates a cone. When the follower is spaced from the apex of the cone it moves in a circular path without rotation and causes complementary movement of one component, but when it is aligned with the apex it no longer moves, even if the rotor continues to rotate, and enables that component to remain stationary while welding is effected.

A piston (14) on a driven rod (13) is slidable in a hole in the dividing wall and supports a carrier (28) to which a first component (36) is secured. Tow additional rods (9 and 10) extend through the chambers. Enlarged portions (11) thereof extend through holes in end walls (4 and 5) of the chambers. The additional rods are caused to reciprocate with fixed amplitude by Scotch cranks (23 to 26, and 31) driven by a motor (30). The relative phases of the Scotch cranks can be varied by axial movement of a sleeve (35) which engages splined shafts of the cranks, one of sets of splines (35) being helical and the other straight. When the additional rods reciprocate in unison they cause local variations in the interior space of the chambers which cause reciprocation of the piston. The amplitude of reciprocation of the piston is less than that of the additional rods but the force exerted is greater. The first component is held in frictional contact with a stationery second component (37) so that frictional heat is generated between them. When the cranks are 180° out of phase the piston ceases to move and the components become welded together. Reciprocation of the piston and associated parts is balanced by a balancer (2) somewhat similar to the reciprocator, while reciprocation of the additional rods and their extensions (16 and 17) in the balancer are balanced by pivoted counterweight (46).

Apparatus for carrying out that method comprises power-driven reciprocatory means (5;5′;10;10′;9;12;11) which carries the reciprocating workpiece. To balance the reciprocatory means there are counterweights (20;21;27) which move in the opposite direction to the reciprocatory means. Each counterweight is constrained to guide means (98) to move along a rectilinear path. Each counterweight is coupled to the reciprocatory means by reversing means, which comprises a pivoted rocker (14;15;24), first linking means (16;17;25) and second linking means (18;19;28).

When sufficient frictional heat has been generated, relative movement is caused to cease and the workpieces became welded. The invention provides apparatus comprising mechanism for effecting reciprocation of a ram (11) and for reducing its stroke rapidly to zero. The mechanism comprises rotatable eccentrics (3, 3ʹ) with followers (4, 4ʹ) connected by flexible blades (7, 7ʹ) to reciprocable elements (5, 5ʹ). Those elements are in turn coupled by flexible blades (10, 10ʹ) to opposite ends (8, 8ʹ) of a rockable linking body (9, 101). A central part of the body is connected by a flexible blade (12) to the ram. The eccentrics rotate at the same speed. When in phase they reciprocate the linking body and ram, but when out of phase the linking body rocks and the ram remains stationary. Adjustment means (41) enables the phase of the eccentrics to be rapidly altered while they rotate.

MONSANTO CHEMICALS Ltd. 14 Sept., 1966 [28 Oct., 1965], No. 45658/65. Heading B5A. [Also in Division C3] Foamed polyethylene sheet is produced from blown tubing extruded through a die 1, 2. The die has an annular passageway comprising a first portion 3 which is substantially parallel sided, e.g. having a width from 0À01-0À05 inch and extending axially more than 0À3 inch from the inlet, a second restricted portion 4, e.g. having a width 0À2-0À9 times the width of portion 3 and extending axially less than 0À2 inch, and a divergent mouth portion 5 whose faces include, e.g. an angle between 10 degrees and 40 degrees and extend axially between 0À05 and 0À2 inch. The first portion 3 may taper slightly in the downstream direction and have an inlet mouth 8. In a second embodiment, Fig. 2 (not shown), the restricted portion occurs further downstream at (12) and the divergent mouth portion imparts a radially outward component of movement to the extrudate. The mouth portion 5 may be cooled by, e.g. air or water, to a temperature below the rest of the die. Duct 7 allows air or other gas access to the extruded tube, which tube may proceed over one or more sizing mandrels, be cooled or heated by currents of air and is flattened by rollers to form lay flat tubing. Take-up rollers may stretch the tubing by as much as a factor of two. The lay flat tubing provides single or double thickness sheeting, whose single thickness may be in the range 0À003-0À25 inch and whose density is preferably less than 5 lbs./cu. ft.

A piston (14) on a driven rod (13) is slidable in a hole in the dividing wall and supports a carrier (28) to which a first component (36) is secured. Tow additional rods (9 and 10) extend through the chambers. Enlarged portions (11) thereof extend through holes in end walls (4 and 5) of the chambers. The additional rods are caused to reciprocate with fixed amplitude by Scotch cranks (23 to 26, and 31) driven by a motor (30). The relative phases of the Scotch cranks can be varied by axial movement of a sleeve (35) which engages splined shafts of the cranks, one of sets of splines (35) being helical and the other straight. When the additional rods reciprocate in unison they cause local variations in the interior space of the chambers which cause reciprocation of the piston. The amplitude of reciprocation of the piston is less than that of the additional rods but the force exerted is greater. The first component is held in frictional contact with a stationery second component (37) so that frictional heat is generated between them. When the cranks are 180 DEG out of phase the piston ceases to move and the components become welded together. Reciprocation of the piston and associated parts is balanced by a balancer (2) somewhat similar to the reciprocator, while reciprocation of the additional rods and their extensions (16 and 17) in the balancer are balanced by pivoted counterweight (46).",ALLWOOD SEARLE & TIMNEY,SEARLE JOHN GILBERT,,https://lens.org/169-139-224-054-020,Granted Patent,no,0,0,14,14,0,B23K20/1205;;B23K20/1205,B23K20/12,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Temperature alarms. GLACIER METAL CO. Ltd. April 26, 1963 [April 27, 1962], No. 16225/62. Heading G4N. [Also in Division F1] Means for detecting when a cyclically moving part of apparatus reaches a predetermined temperature comprises a first resonant circuit 8, 8a carried by the moving part; a second resonant circuit 12, tuned to the same frequency, carried by a fixed part, and inductively coupled to the first circuit; and a temperature-sensitive device which opens or closes a connection in the first resonant circuit to change the energy drawn by the first resonant circuit from the second, the change operating a warning device, and/or controlling the operation of the apparatus. Overheating of a bearing 2 causes the bearing metal to melt, shorting leads 5, 6, and a signal at the resonant frequency of the circuits applied to terminals 13 is then transmitted through the amplifier 14 to operate relay 15 and thus actuate an alarm or control the operation of the machine. The device may be mounted on the rotor blades of a turbine, Figs. 2, 3 (not shown), or on a piston of an I.C. engine, Fig. 4 (not shown), and a thermal switch may be employed in place of a fusable element. Instead of completing the tuned circuit the fusable element may be arranged to remove a short from the tuned circuit, Fig. 6 (not shown). A number of individual pairs of resonant circuits each associated with separate moving parts of a machine may be fed to a common relay by a selector switch, Fig. 7 (not shown).",GLACIER CO LTD,GILBERT THOMAS JOHN,,https://lens.org/070-964-228-730-364,Granted Patent,no,0,5,2,2,0,G01K1/024;;G01K11/06;;G01K13/04;;H02H7/0852,G01K1/02;;G01K11/06;;G01K13/04;;H02H7/085,F1B B2S           -;;F1K K14           -;;F1T TB4A          -;;G4N NCTX          NCTX;;G4N NDG           DG;;G4N N1CX          N6D+;;G4N N1C4          N6D+;;G4N N3F           N6D+;;G4N N4C           N6D+;;G4N N4D           N6D+;;G4N N4R1          N6D+;;G4N N4S           N6D+;;G4N N4X           N6D+;;G4N N5A3          N6D+;;G4N N6D1          N6D+;;G4N N7A           N6D+,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

[Also in Division A4] Foamable thermoplastic synthetic resin is extruded through a slit orifice 6, initiation of foaming occurring as the resin passes between rollers 8, 9 so that expansion thereof is between and around teeth 12. The rollers are rotated as shown, the teeth at any instant lying in the plane through axes 10, 11 being offset with respect to one another, see also Fig. 4 (not reproduced). The consequent product is a modification of that described in Specification 1,110,287, being a foamed extruded sheet having not only corrugations which are parallel to the direction of extrusion, but also a superimposed wave pattern along the length of the corrugations, see Fig. 1. Rollers 8, 9 may be replaced by one or two pairs of comb-shaped members reciprocated across and immediately downstream of orifice 6. The extrudate is supported until cool by a roller or endless belt or is passed over or between flat plates. The product may be used for packaging, in upholstery, as thermal insulation or as an underlay. Among various resins mentioned are polyethylene, polystyrene, copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate and graft styrene-butadiene copolymers.

The component is inserted into the cassette and an aperture at the open end is shaped to frictionally engage a thickened portion of the component with a force greater than forces transmitted to the component during a friction welding operation. The component is pressed into the cassette to a predetermined depth so that a portion remains protruding and forms the weld interface.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP. 6 Aug., 1968, No. 37412/68. Heading H3B. In a magnetic thin film memory information is read out of a word by applying an oscillatory active signal of frequency # together with a biasing magnetic field to the elements of a word and detecting the phase of signals at frequency # produced in the associated bit lines. The memory of Fig. 2 comprises in groups 10a, 10b to 10m each of which is an N x n array of anisotropic thin films and includes n bit lines 11 each extending along a respective row of elements and a single bias line 12 extending along all the columns of elements in the group for simultaneously applying a hard axis bias field. To effect read out of data from a word storage location an oscillatory drive signal is supplied by word drive circuit 14 to the word line coupled to the required word storage location and a bias signal applied simultaneously to the bias line 12 of the group in which the required storage location is located. A sense signal is developed in all of the sense/bit lines 11 of the memory but only the bit lines of the group to which the bias current is applied have a significant component at the fundamental frequency # of the sinusoidal drive signal. The signals at the fundamental frequency are passed by filters 23 to phase detectors 24 and the signals developed on output lines 25 are indicative of the data stored, Fig. 3 (not shown). Information is stored by applying bit currents to selected bit/sense lines of the required polarity simultaneously with the oscillatory word drive signal and bias field applied to a selected word line, Fig. 4. As shown all the diodes 27 of each segment are connected to a respective control line 29 and all diodes 28 are connected to control line 30. In order to select the bit lines of a respective group for the storage of information control lines 29, 30 are both connected to ground potential, control lines 29, 30 of unselected segments being connected to negative and positive potentials respectively. Resistors 31 and capacitors 32 present an open circuit to the bit currents but provide a resonable termination at the high frequencies of the sense signals during reacting. The oscillatory drive signals may be applied to the bias lines and the D.C. bias signal applied to the word lines. The hard axis bias field may be provided by field windings or coils surrounding respective segments of the memory instead of a bias line.",IBM,AXFORD JOHN GILBERT,,https://lens.org/003-393-242-548-191,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,3,0,G07F13/02;;G11C11/14,G07F13/02;;G11C11/14,H3B B200          AC;;H3B B202          AC;;H3B B203          AC;;H3B B236          AC;;H3B B237          AC;;H3B B277          AC;;H3B B303          AC;;H3B B350          AC;;H3B B351          AC;;H3B B376          AC;;H3B B390          AC;;H3B B391          AC;;H3B B393          AC;;H3B B404          AC;;H3B B413          AC;;H3B B420          AC;;H3B B486          AC;;H3B B491          AC;;H3B B492          AC;;H3B B501          AC;;H3X X5A           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Battledores or racquets used in playing ping-pong, table tennis, or other games are constructed with expansible frames, so that the vellum, parchment, or the like which forms the striking-face, can be readily tightened up. The frame is made up of two pieces 1, Fig. 1, of wood, having raised edges 2 for the attachment of the vellum ; between the pieces 1 a wedge-shaped piece 4 is placed, which is connected by a screw 6, Fig. 2, to the handle 7 by means of the screwed sleeve 8. A collar 10, screwed on the sleeve 8, is connected by four metal or other straps 11 to the pieces 1, so that, on turning the handle in the proper direction relatively to the head, the parts of the head will be drawn down on the wedge 4, thus stretching the vellum. The extent of the movement of the pieces 1 is limited by a slotted strap 12, as shown. The collar 10 may be locked against a projection on the sleeve 8 by a milled nut 16. In a modification, Fig. 4, a downwardly-tapering wedge is used to force apart the two sides of the frame, the wedge being connected by a pair of nuts 6<a> to a screw 6, which screws into a nut 17<a> secured on the handle. The wedge slides against bearing- strips attached to the two parts of the head, and the upper parts of the wedge are fitted with metal guides 18, which prevent the displacement of the wedge. Slots and tongues or studs may, however, be used. The upper and lower extremities of the raised edges are embraced by metal plates 19, and a band 20 of leather or other flexible material is placed round the periphery, to prevent the puckering of the vellum which is attached to the band 20.

A piston (14) on a driven rod (13) is slidable in a hole in the dividing wall and supports a carrier (28) to which a first component (36) is secured. Tow additional rods (9 and 10) extend through the chambers. Enlarged portions (11) thereof extend through holes in end walls (4 and 5) of the chambers. The additional rods are caused to reciprocate with fixed amplitude by Scotch cranks (23 to 26, and 31) driven by a motor (30). The relative phases of the Scotch cranks can be varied by axial movement of a sleeve (35) which engages splined shafts of the cranks, one of sets of splines (35) being helical and the other straight. When the additional rods reciprocate in unison they cause local variations in the interior space of the chambers which cause reciprocation of the piston. The amplitude of reciprocation of the piston is less than that of the additional rods but the force exerted is greater. The first component is held in frictional contact with a stationery second component (37) so that frictional heat is generated between them. When the cranks are 180 DEG out of phase the piston ceases to move and the components become welded together. Reciprocation of the piston and associated parts is balanced by a balancer (2) somewhat similar to the reciprocator, while reciprocation of the additional rods and their extensions (16 and 17) in the balancer are balanced by pivoted counterweight (46).",ALLWOOD SEARLE & TIMNEY,SEARLE JOHN GILBERT,,https://lens.org/186-412-838-425-130,Granted Patent,no,0,0,14,14,0,B23K20/1205;;B23K20/1205,B23K20/12,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

GILBERT. 22 May, 1969 [25 May, 1968], No. 25093/68. Addition to 1,099,549. Heading B8A. [Also in Division F2] An hydraulic brake in a conveyer roller comprises two, flat, coplanar pistons 43, 46 which are reciprocated in their planes, at rightangles to each other in respective working chambers C, D containing hydraulic fluid. An eccentric pin 49 fast on a stationary shaft 27 engages the piston 46 and reciprocation of both the pistons is caused when a rotor, consisting of a cylindrical cup-like body 28 and a plug-like body 29 fitted in the body 28, is driven by a load passing along the conveyer. To permit the passage of fluid within the working chamber C when the piston 43 is reciprocated, slight clearance between one or both of the flat side surfaces of the piston and one or both respectively of the adjacent radial faces of the bodies 28, 29 is necessary. Similarly, clearance is provided to permit the passage of fluid within the chamber D. Instead of relying on such clearances, communication for the fluid may comprise ducts and spring-loaded valves at A, B. Due to the strokes of the pistons being 90 degrees out of phase, a substantially uniform torque resistance to rotation of the roller is produced.",GILBERT JOHN EDWIN,GILBERT JOHN EDWIN,,https://lens.org/113-750-450-244-847,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,B65G13/075;;B65G2203/025,B65G13/00;;B65G13/075,B8A A4JA          A4JA;;B8A A4K1D         -;;F2E E1B           -;;F2S SBD           SBD102;;F2S S102          SBD102;;F2S S113          SBD102;;F2S S121          SBD102;;F2S S122          SBD102;;F2S S123          SBD102,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

MONSANTO CHEMICALS Ltd. 17 June, 1966 [22 July, 1965], No. 31261/ 65. Heading B5A and B5N. [Also in Divisions A4 and F2] A sheet or tube corrugated over part or all of its width or circumference respectively and made of a foamed aliphatic thermoplastic resin is produced by extrusion through a die whose extrusion slot 6 is bounded by fluted lips 7, 9, the flutes 12 in one lip being offset with respect to those in the other lip. With this arrangement the corrugations are formed parallel to the direction of extrusion and the preferred thickness t, Fig. 2, is between 0À05-0À25 inch and preferably d and w are 3 to 5 times t. Other lip shapes are described, Figs 6-9 (not shown), and a take-off mechanism may comprise a roller or conveyer belt, or the extrudate may be supported by a plate perhaps associated with a second plate such that the passageway thereby formed converges downstream. The product has a preferred density in the range 2-3 1bs./ft.<SP>3</SP> and is intended primarily for packaging, upholstery or thermal insulation purposes or as a carpet underlay, and in particular may be laminated on one or both sides with, e.g. paper, cloth, metal (aluminium foil), or a film or sheet of foamed or otherwise thermoplastic resin (polyolefin). The product may be laminated with itself e.g. by folding and glueing a sheet one or more times, or with like material and in any case it is preferred in this case that the extrusion directions of adjacent layers be at an angle to one another. Specific resins mentioned are polyethylene, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, vinyl or vinylidene chloride, vinyl acetate, ethyl acrylate or methyl methacrylate and copolymers such as ethylene - vinyl acetate copolymer.

Variable-speed ratchet-gears; adjustable throw cranks. WHITE, G. J., and KNAPMAN, C. H. Jan. 22, 1948, No. 2022. [Classes 80(ii) and 80(iii)] A variable-speed gear, for permitting the controlled lowering of a material-discharging feed-screw conveyer on a vehicle for distributing solid materials such as agricultural fertilizer, lime, road stone, gravel or sea sand, as described in Specification 595,687, [Group XXX], uses an adjustablethrow crank 12 driving pawl-carrying arms 23, oscillating about a ratchet-wheel 27 on a driven shaft 22, the crank comprising a crankpin 12 carried by a disc 10 which, to change the throw, is turned about an eccentric pivot 9 carried by an outer sleeve-shaft 3, by turning therein an inner concentric driving shaft 4. carrying on an arm 14, an eccentric pin 15 engaging a slot 16 in the crankdisc 10 at the opposite side of the shaft-axis from the pivot 9. The crank- ,disc 10 is slotted at 13 to 'clear the end of the inner shaft 4, the crankpin 12 being carried on a bridgepiece 11 integral with the disc 10 and accommodating the arm 14. The concentric shafts 3, 4 are normally clamped together for rotation as an input unit by an end-nut 7 which is slackened to permit the shafts to be turned relatively to adjust the crank-throw from zero (as shown) upwards. To permit speed adjustment to half a tooth pitch, the oscillating arms 23 may each carry two pawls spaced by an integral number of ratchet-tooth pitches plus one-half a tooth-pitch. As applied to the fertilizer discharger described in Specification 595,687, [Group XXX], the shafts 3, 4 constitute the input member driven through a friction drive by the vehicle wheels, and the ratchet - wheel shaft 22 drives through an irreversible worm gear an output shaft 2, which drives through an overrunning clutch a winchdrum permitting the lowering at controlled speed, under gravity load, of one or more pivotally-mounted feed-screws which discharge the fertilizer.

A piston (14) on a driven rod (13) is slidable in a hole in the dividing wall and supports a carrier (28) to which a first component (36) is secured. Two additional rods (9 and 10) extend through the chambers. Enlarged portions (11) thereof extend through holes in end walls (4 and 5) of the chambers. The additional rods are caused to reciprocate with fixed amplitude by Scotch cranks (23 to 26, and 31) driven by a motor (30). The relative phases of the Scotch cranks can be varied by axial movement of a sleeve (35) which engages splined shafts of the cranks, one of sets of splines (35) being helical and the other straight. When the additional rods reciprocate in unison they cause local variations in the interior space of the chambers which cause reciprocation of the piston. The amplitude of reciprocation of the piston is less than that of the additional rods but the force exerted is greater. The first component is held in frictional contact with a stationary second component (37) so that frictional heat is generated between them. When the cranks are 180° out of phase the piston ceases to move and the components become welded together. Reciprocation of the piston and associated parts is balanced by a balancer (2) somewhat similar to the reciprocator, while reciprocation of the additional rods and their extensions (16 and 17) in the balancer are balanced by pivoted counterweight (46).",ALLWOOD SEARLE & TIMNEY,SEARLE JOHN GILBERT,,https://lens.org/141-496-510-060-121,Patent Application,yes,2,0,14,14,0,B23K20/1205;;B23K20/1205,B23K20/12,,0,0,,,,PENDING

A piston (14) on a driven rod (13) is slidable in a hole in the dividing wall and supports a carrier (28) to which a first component (36) is secured. Tow additional rods (9 and 10) extend through the chambers. Enlarged portions (11) thereof extend through holes in end walls (4 and 5) of the chambers. The additional rods are caused to reciprocate with fixed amplitude by Scotch cranks (23 to 26, and 31) driven by a motor (30). The relative phases of the Scotch cranks can be varied by axial movement of a sleeve (35) which engages splined shafts of the cranks, one of sets of splines (35) being helical and the other straight. When the additional rods reciprocate in unison they cause local variations in the interior space of the chambers which cause reciprocation of the piston. The amplitude of reciprocation of the piston is less than that of the additional rods but the force exerted is greater. The first component is held in frictional contact with a stationery second component (37) so that frictional heat is generated between them. When the cranks are 180 DEG out of phase the piston ceases to move and the components become welded together. Reciprocation of the piston and associated parts is balanced by a balancer (2) somewhat similar to the reciprocator, while reciprocation of the additional rods and their extensions (16 and 17) in the balancer are balanced by pivoted counterweight (46).","ALLWOOD, SEARLE & TIMNEY (HOLDINGS) LIMITED","SEARLE, JOHN GILBERT",,https://lens.org/081-720-475-068-222,Granted Patent,yes,2,0,14,14,0,B23K20/1205;;B23K20/1205,B23K20/12,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Conductive patterns on the first and second part are interconnected to form a coil. A number of such layers so formed are assembled to produce the saddle coil with the required electrical connections between the layers.

ALLWOOD, SEARLE & TIMNEY Ltd. 16 Nov., 1970 [19 Nov., 1969], No. 56525/69. Heading B3R. Friction welding apparatus comprises work supports 8, 11, the support 11 being adjustable between a friction position in which it follows a path which is at least substantially circular but does not rotate relatively to the second support and a welding position in which it does not move relatively to the second support. The motion of the work support is derived from drive means including a rotor (e.g. crank portion 28 of shaft 16, Fig. 2) the axis (32) of which on rotation generates a cone, and a follower (e.g. bearing 37) which may be located at the apex of this cone or spaced from it, the former position producing no motion of the follower and the spaced position giving rise to a circular but non-rotary movement of the follower and hence also of the work support. In the embodiment described in relation to Figs. 1, 2, a pair of parallel shafts 16 having cranked portions 28, 29, 30 are driven from a common drive shaft 22 to effect the desired motion of a carriage 13 supporting the work support 11. Axial movement of the shafts 16 may be effected by hydraulic cylinder and piston unit 25 to adjust the apparatus between the friction and welding positions and this movement is possible while rotation of the shafts 16 continues. The crank portions 29 of the shafts 16 provide for dynamic counterbalancing of the motion of the carriage 13, by means of a counterweight 41. The provision of a flywheel in the drive and of means for mounting a plurality of workpieces for simultaneous welding are envisaged. In a second embodiment (Figs. 3-5, not shown) adjustment from the friction to the welding position is effected by altering the position of the apex of the cone without altering the relative longitudinal positions of the rotor and follower.",ALLWOOD SEARLE & TIMNEY,SEARLE JOHN GILBERT,,https://lens.org/103-184-228-237-252,Granted Patent,no,0,0,7,7,0,B23K20/1205;;B23K20/1205,B23K20/12,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

This device essentially comprised of a hydraulic component, a rotor attached with levers, gear box, a generator, control systems and other accessories. Hydraulic component exerts pressure on the tip of the levers attached to the rotor shaft. The rotor component works on the principle of wheel and axle and converts the hydraulic pressure applied on the lever into rotary motion. The gear system attached to the rotor converts the low speed rotation to high speed rotation suitable for generating electricity. The generator component consists of the electrical generator and other control systems suitable to produce rated power. By the whole mechanism the input is multiplied. It is mainly because the present invention uses lever mechanism. The mechanical advantage of lever magnifies the input force and hence relatively low energy will rotate the rotor component, which is attached with a more powerful generator. Hence it is possible to produce more electric power than the one used for input force.",G JOHN GILBERT;;J VIJO GILBERT,G JOHN GILBERT;;J VIJO GILBERT,,https://lens.org/004-798-879-501-026,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,F03G7/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Also limiting may be produced by automatic gain control from a rectifier connected to the input circuit, or the diode limiter circuit 18 may be connected between anode and control grid of the valve 12 or across a further inductor coupled to the input circuit inductor 13.

Dielectric heating apparatus. RADYNE Ltd. July 4, 1962 [July 18, 1961], No. 26013/61. Heading H5H. One of the electrodes of a dielectric heating apparatus forms part of an assembly movable from a loading to a work position, the assembly also including a contact device which extends all round the electrode and, when the latter is raised to the work position, makes resilient electrical connection with a fixed contact device connected to an earthed screen which extends around the work position, thereby completing an earthed screen which wholly encloses the work position. Material 30 to be heated is loaded upon the movable electrode 28 mounted on a tray 8 attached to the lower platen 29 of a press, the platen being then raised so that the upturned edge of the tray penetrates into channel 19 between spring contacts 20. Live electrode 23 is connected to the radio-frequency generator via strip 25, and capacitor plates 26 and 27, the spacing between which is adjustable to permit variation of the power input. An arrangement for feeding the load on to the lower electrode assembly is described (Fig. 1, not shown) in which the assembly includes a series of ceramic rollers on to which a metal plate carrying the load is slid. The apparatus is applicable to the curing of rubber and plastics, and the drying of wood pulp and refractory bricks.",RADYNE LTD,WARD JOHN REGINALD GILBERT,,https://lens.org/062-288-403-375-507,Granted Patent,no,0,3,1,1,0,H05B6/46,H05B6/76,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The process provides a simple but efficient process for using waste carbon-based materials and waste metal ore materials, and forming a useable product, which is ready for smelting. Rotating drum or pan agglomerators are relatively low cost to build, and are capable of very high tonnage throughputs.",SOLSYS LTD,KENNETH JOHN GILBERT;;WEBSTER JOHN SAMUEL,,https://lens.org/151-636-657-241-140,Granted Patent,no,8,2,10,10,0,C22B1/2406;;C22B1/243;;C22B1/245;;C22B7/02;;Y02P10/20;;C22B1/2406;;C22B1/243;;C22B1/245;;C22B7/02,C22B1/24;;C22B1/243;;C22B1/245;;C22B7/02,,1,0,,,"DATABASE WPI Section Ch, Week 200319 Derwent Publications Ltd., London, GB; Class M25, AN 2003-201942 XP002397634 & ZA 200 105 780 A (EARTH MINING & REPRODUCTION CC) 28 August 2002 (2002-08-28) abstract",ACTIVE

BRITISH DOMESTIC APPLIANCES Ltd. 1 Nov., 1968 [3 Nov., 1967], No. 49980/67. Heading F2G. [Also in Division H2] A plug and socket connector connects leads incorporated in the hose of a vacuum cleaner to supply leads inside the cleaner body for the supply of current to a motorized brush or beater in the cleaner head. As shown an end wall 1 of the vacuum cleaner body has an aperture 2 through which is inserted a cylindrical plug 3 attached to one end of a flexible hose 4. Three radial studs 5, 6, 7 are formed on the plug, two of which 6, 7 include contacts 8, 9 connected in a junction box 10 to leads incorporated in the hose 4. The studs 5, 6, 7 enter guide slots such as 12, on the socket, defined by flange portion 14 around the aperture 2 and a cylindrical flange 15A formed on a cover 15. Each slot has an axial part such as 12A, and a helical portion 12B terminating in a re-entrant notch 12C. The plug is locked in an operative position in the socket by inserting the studs into the axial sections of the slots and turning the plug until the studs snap into the re-entrant notches urged by a resilient ring 18 against which the plug presses. In this position, the contacts 8, 9 make contact with spring contact blades 21, 22 connected to supply leads in the cleaner body. A cylindrical shutter 26 shields the ends of the socket contacts 21, 22 when the plug is out of the socket. Three lugs 27, 28 (29), on the shutter 26 project into the guide slots and are formed with semi-cylindrical seats (27A, 28A, 29A, Figs. 1, 2, not shown) to receive the studs 5, 6, 7. Upon insertion of the plug, the lugs move from the axial portions 12A of the guide slots into the re-entrant notches 12C against the influence of springs 30, 31, 32. Two notches 28B, 29B on the shutter then become, aligned with the ends of the contact blades 21, 22 allowing contact between the blades and plug contacts 8, 9. In another embodiment, the plug is provided with only two radial studs corresponding with two notches in the end wall 1. The socket does not have guide slots, the plug being locked in its operative position by the location of a resilient arm carried on the shutter in notches formed on a raised track traversed by the arm as the plug is turned in the socket.",BRITISH DOMESTIC APPLIANCES,GILBERT KENNETH JOHN;;PYCROFT RAYMOND JOHN,,https://lens.org/192-096-763-479-139,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,A47L9/242;;A47L9/244;;H01R13/005;;H01R13/453;;H01R39/24;;H01R39/64,A47L9/24;;H01R13/453;;H01R13/523;;H01R24/00,F2G G36           G4G;;F2G G4G           G4G;;H2E ECBX          ECBX;;H2E E110          ECBX;;H2E E3A12         -;;H2E E3A14B        -;;H2E E3A3          -;;H2E E3A6A         -;;H2E E3A6C         -;;H2E E3C2C         -;;H2E E3C2D         -;;H2E E3C2E         -;;H2E E3C7          -;;H2E E3C9          -;;H2E E3D8          -;;H2E E3E17         -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Automatic phase control systems. STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES Ltd. May 3, 1961, No. 16041/61. Class 40 (5). In a television vestigial sideband receiving system a demodulating oscillator 5 is locked in phase, by a phase comparator 15, with the incoming carrier during line synchronizing intervals when a gate 6 is opened to the carrier, the gate being operated by a sampling pulse generator 9 actuated from the amplified output of the demodulator 3. Negative modulation of the carrier is used and with reduced amplitude of the carrier (excess carrier ratio=¢ for example) and if during over-modulation peaks the demodulator output operated gate 6 to pass an undesired phase-reversed carrier signal wrongly synchronizing the oscillator (with opposite phase) this condition would be unstable due to the more numerous line synchronizing pulses occurring during frame synchronizing intervals when the carrier is never overmodulated. A filter 8 also permits direct synchronizing of the oscillator 5 from the gate 6. Two stages of demodulation can alternatively be used.",STANDARD TELEPHONES CABLES LTD,MCALLAN JOHN GILBERT;;LAING JOHN DOUGLAS,,https://lens.org/009-815-221-623-266,Granted Patent,no,0,1,3,3,0,H04N5/455,H04N5/455,H3A AD            AD,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

High pressure streams of liquid are traversed along a path in a pulping zone lowermost in first region of the body. The liquid forms a pumpable slurry with the mineral solids in the zone, and the slurry is then pumped from the zone leaving an undercut cavity sufficient to cause collapse of the overburden of solids. The collapsed overburden is then formed into additional pumpable slurry which is removed by pumping. Successive stages of excavation are carried out by moving the streams of liquid downwardly to a second region where the foregoing steps are repeated. In the apparatus a caisson is disposed vertically in the body and stabilized by means of a plurality of circumferentially positioned pilings. A plurality of high velocity nozzles are mounted in the caisson to direct liquid streams into a pulping zone surrounding the caisson. The slurry which is formed in the pulping zone flows through portals in the caisson into a slurry sump in the lower end of the caisson where a pump removes the slurry through a discharge line leading from the caisson. In one embodiment the caisson is fixedly secured to the caisson and jets are provided to direct liquid streams into regions below the lower ends of the caisson and pilings to sink the apparatus downwardly to the next lower region for additional stages of excavation. In another embodiment, the caisson is mounted for relative vertical movement with respect to stationary pilings.",,Miscovich; John A.;;Gilbert; John J.,,https://lens.org/158-748-843-105-696,Amended Patent,yes,5,19,1,17,0,B65G53/30;;E02F3/8808;;E21C25/60;;E21C41/00;;E21C47/00;;E21F13/042;;B65G53/30;;E02F3/8808;;E21F13/042;;E21C47/00;;E21C41/00;;E21C25/60,B65G53/30;;E02F3/88;;E21C25/60;;E21C41/00;;E21C47/00;;E21F13/04,299 17;;37195;;299 18,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The pellets are obtainable from a particulate carbon-based material and a binder, and the process comprises the following steps: admixing the material and binder, and agglomerating the so-formed mixture by tumbling. The tumbling action, such as in a rotary drum, serves to agglomerate the particles and bind the mixture into the pellets, usually with a variable size distribution. No mechanical compression force is required, and the process can be carried out at ambient or near-ambient temperature. The process provides a simple but efficient process for using waste carbon-based materials, and forming a useable fuel product, which is easily transportable and efficiently combustible. Rotating drum or pan agglomerators are relatively low cost to build, and are capable of very high tonnage throughputs.

The pellets are obtainable from a particulate carbon-based material and a binder, the process comprising the following steps: admixing the material and binder, and agglomerating the so-formed mixture by tumbling. The tumbling action, such as in a rotary drum, serves to agglomerate the particles and bind the mixture into the pellets, usually with a variable size distribution. No mechanical compression force is required, and with the binders used, the process can be carried out at ambient temperature. The process provides a simple but efficient process for using waste carbon-based materials, and forming a useable fuel product, which is easily transportable and efficiently combustible. Rotating drum or pan agglomerators are relatively low cost to build, and are capable of very high tonnage throughputs. Customised products can be produced and the process enhances the economics of ash and sulphur removal in coal upgrade plants.",APPLIED SILICATE TECHNOLOGIES;;GILBERT JOHN KENNETH;;WEBSTER JOHN SAMUEL,GILBERT JOHN KENNETH;;WEBSTER JOHN SAMUEL,,https://lens.org/000-645-489-187-673,Patent Application,yes,6,9,16,16,0,C10L5/105;;C10L5/12;;C10F7/06;;C10L5/12,C10L5/10;;C10L5/12,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Motor vehicle driving gear. ROVER CO. Ltd. March 21, 1960 [March 21, 1959], No. 9881/59. Classes 79(2), 79(3) and 79(5). A motor vehicle comprises an engine 1 driving normal change - speed gearing 3, additional gearing 5 to drive the road wheels 2 a first disengageable coupling between the gearing 3 and 5, a power-take-off shaft 15 engaging the additional gearing 5 through a disengageable coupling 14 and an auxiliary driving means 10 capable, when the first coupling is disengaged, of driving the shaft 15 and hence the vehicle wheels at a slower speed than that imparted by the change-speed gearing 3 when the first coupling is engaged. In the form of construction shown in Figs. 1 and 3 the auxiliary driving means propels the vehicle at approximately one m.p.h. while the main engine, 1, drives a shaft, 29, through belts, 27, and clutch, 25, from a shaft, 8, to operate an implement such as a rotary snow plough. The auxiliary driving means is in the form of a secondary engine 10, driving a hydraulic pump 11 connected by pipes 12 to a hydraulic motor 13 which drives the shaft 15. Alternatively the drive may be by mechanical means to shaft 15 or a fluid pump may be coupled directly to the main engine. The first disengageable coupling takes the form of a gear wheel 9 meshing with the additional gearing 5 which may be put in engagement with shaft 8. The arrows of Fig. 3 indicate the ""power flow"" in the vehicle when driven by aux:liary engine 10. In Fig. 1 are shown an interlock 24 between levers 22 and 23 controlling the engagement of the first and second couplings 9 and 14 to prevent their engagement together, an isolating valve, 36, in one of the hydraulic lines, tappings 32 and 33 for powering other machinery and lever 20 for controlling the pump output and hence vehicle speed. The hydraulic pipes 12 may be provided with self-sealing joints 22 to permit the removal of the auxiliary engine when it is not required and with a reversing valve 16 in the pipes 12.

The pellets are obtainable from a particulate carbon-based material and a binder, the process comprising the following steps: admixing the material and binder, and agglomerating the so-formed mixture by tumbling. The tumbling action, such as in a rotary drum, serves to agglomerate the particles and bind the mixture into the pellets, usually with a variable size distribution. No mechanical compression force is required, and with the binders used, the process can be carried out at ambient temperature. The process provides a simple but efficient process for using waste carbon-based materials, and forming a useable fuel product, which is easily transportable and efficiently combustible. Rotating drum or pan agglomerators are relatively low cost to build, and are capable of very high tonnage throughputs. Customised products can be produced and the process enhances the economics of ash and sulphur removal in coal upgrade plants.",APPLIED SILICATE TECHNOLOGIES,SAMUEL GILBERT JOHN KENNETH WE,"SAULSES CO., LTD.

The valve member is allowed some latitude for movement laterally of the passage, permitting self-centring of the member.",BSA GUNS,BOWKETT JOHN;;GILBERT SIMON JEREMY,,https://lens.org/128-112-837-828-773,Patent Application,no,3,2,2,2,0,F16K1/302;;F16K1/307;;F16K25/005;;F17C13/04;;F17C2205/0323;;F17C2205/0382;;F17C2223/0123;;F17C2223/036;;F17C2227/048;;F17C2270/07;;F17C2270/0745,F16K1/30;;F16K25/00;;F17C13/04,F2V VP102         VP102;;F2V VX1           VX1;;U1S S1795,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Hinchley, J. W., and Gorton, G. March 13, 1915. Peat, preparing.-A press for expressing liquids from peat and other fibrous and carbonaceous materials is provided with means for passing steam, hot or cold air or other gaseous fluid through the peat in a direction at right-angles to the movement of the piston. The press comprises cylinders 5, 5<1>, and annular pistons 4, 4<1>, 4"". The cylinder walls have drainage grooves 5<a> covered by strainers and leading to discharge pipes 34, 33. Steam &c. is admitted through a pipe 29, conr.ected by screwed caps 12' to a hollow ring 24 and pipe 11, which have perforated tops covered by strainers secured by caps 25, 13. The ring and pipe also serve for discharging liquid. To equalize the pressure, the cylinder 5' and preferably the ring 4 are not carried up to the press-head 9<1>, between which and the cylinder may be provided a cover running on rails. A simpler form of press having a single cylinder, piston, and tube 11 is described. Specification 24819/11 is referred to. In treating peat, the liquid is expressed by first applying a pressure of 1000 lb., then passing steam &c. through the material in the press, and finally applying a pressure of say, 1500 lb. During the passage of the steam &c., the pressure may remain at 1000 lb. or be reduced to, say, 200 lb. or zero, or be increased. The final product, if powdered and dropped through the air, loses further moisture, but the cakes may be used as such or carbonized to obtain by-products. In order that the peat may comprise a substantial quantity of fibre, a mixture of upper and lower bog is used.",HINCHLEY JOHN WILLIAM;;GORTON GILBERT,HINCHLEY JOHN WILLIAM;;GORTON GILBERT,,https://lens.org/022-771-238-946-992,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,C10G5/04,C10G5/04,F4G GFBH          GFBH,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Fluid-pressure servomotor-control systems. NAPIER & SON Ltd., D. July 25, 1958 [July 26, 1957], No. 23706/57. Class 135. [Also in Group XXVI] A control system for aircraft power plant comprising a gas turbine coupled to a propeller or helicopter rotor includes a swashplate fuel pump 13, the output of which is controlled in accordance with engine speed, and is passed through a metering valve 43 controlled by a servo mechanism 56, 57, also in accordance with engine speed, whereby the valve has a unique setting for each engine speed. Fuel pump 13 is of the type in which inclination of the swashplate is adjusted by a piston 18 working in a cylinder whose ends are interconnected through an orifice 23 and controlled by a leak-off valve 34 operated by a diaphragm 30 subjected through a port 25 in the pump casing 15 to a pressure proportional to engine speed, the diaphragm also being subjected to the loading of a spring 36, which can be varied by a pilotoperated lever 38 to vary the datum engine speed setting. The longitudinal position of sleeve 43, which is formed with a tapered port 44 furnishing the variable area fuel metering orifice, is adjusted by a power piston 57 controlled by a pilot valve 56 connected to an operating diaphragm 52 subjected to the pressures on the two sides of diaphragm 30. Piston 57 acts upon a valve loading spring 55, and is connected to sleeve 43 by a link 62. The latter is also connected by a link 82 to a lever 81 controlling a fuel dump valve 79, controlling the connection of the fuel supply line to a dump line 76 or the burner line 80. By operating lever 81 the pilot may open the fuel metering orifice to exceed its minimum setting, for engine starting. The pressure drop across metering valve 43 is communicated through pipes 70, 71 to the opposite sides of a diaphragm 73 controlling a bleed valve 75 connected to chamber 20 of the pump governor, to limit the pump output if the pressure drop exceeds a predetermined value;",NAPIER & SON LTD,SKELLERN JOHN;;GILBERT RONALD ALBERT,,https://lens.org/109-271-849-835-320,Granted Patent,no,0,3,2,2,0,B64C11/305;;F02C9/30,B64C11/30;;F02C9/30,F1G G10B          G10B;;F1G G18           G10B,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Programmed control of transfer machines. JOHN THOMPSON ORDNANCE CO. Ltd. April 28, 1969 [Jan.27, 1968; Feb.29, 1968], Nos.4358/68 .and 9756/68. Heading G3N. In a method of controlling a selection of operations on a series of workpieces, some of which operations may be specific to each workpiece, fed along a feed path to a machine having two or more separately controlled tools, a programme determining element is fed along the path in advance of the workpiece or a group of workpieces which co-operates with a reading means to generate signals characteristic of the operations to be performed. The arrangement may be applied to transfer machines having a large number of working stations some of which operations on certain workpieces may be required to be omitted. The programme element 20 which may be a simple planar peg board or a cubical arrangement where operations in several planes are required passes along a reciprocating feed bar 15 in advance of the workpiece(s) 17. The programme means may take other forms e.g. magnetic or photoelectric which co-operate with reading devices 24 1 , 25 1 . Alternatively sensing devices may be fluidic or may furnish sonic or supersonic wave energy which is reflected from the means 20. The readers feed into a programmer 29 1 having two channels one for controlling the associated tool head and the other controlling a locating means 261. In a multi-function machine such arrangements would be repeated at each station. Fig.2 (not shown) illustrates a means for positioning workpieces and comprises heads (11 1 , 12 1 ) on each:side of a forked elevating element (36) operated by fluid-pressure. The programme element has lateral projections (39) having locating face portions (40) engaging with downwardly projecting rods (41) supported by heads (42) adjustable vertically so that tools (13 1 , 14 1 ) may operate at the required positions. The tool head (43) has downwardly projecting rods (44) the lower ends of which constitute stop faces which arrest downward movement of the head when they engage the upper face of element (38). The succeeding workpiece conforms dimensionally to the element (38) but does not have the locating face portions (39). Monitor means may be provided comprising a plurality of indicator elements e.g. lamps, over which a mask member having a plurality of closable apertures which enable an operator to check whether the apparatus is functioning correctly.",JOHN THOMPSON ORDNANCE COMPANY,SEARLE JOHN GILBERT;;KILHAMS PETER,,https://lens.org/040-325-626-495-153,Granted Patent,no,0,6,1,1,0,G05B19/128;;G05B2219/36513;;G05B2219/36523;;G05B2219/45051,G05B19/12,G3N NBA2X         BP;;G3N NG1A          G1A;;G3N N252          BP;;G3N N265X         BP;;G3N N265X         G1A;;G3N N353          BP;;G3N N381          BP;;G3N N381          G1A;;G3N N402X         G1A,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

[Also in Group XXIV] In a device for guiding a floating member 3 for rectilinear movement with respect to a fixed member 1, particularly for a measuring head as in Specification 724,228, a spigot 11 on the lower end of the member 3 slides in a fixed sleeve 10, while the upper end of the member 3 is supported from the fixed member by a spring strip arrangement 5. The arrangement 5 comprises three spring strips, the central strip being shorter than the outer two. Upper and lower displacement of the member 3 are limited respectively by the lock-nut and the head of a fixed bolt 35 passing freely through a tongue 34 on the member 3. The lower end of the spigot 11 serves as a measuring anvil for a workpiece to be gauged, movement of the anvil being transmitted via a knife-edge 28 on the member 3 and a lever 16 to a spring-loaded slidable needle 19. The upper end of the needle 19 is of parabolic shape and its movement varies the escape area from a valve orifice 26 connected to an air supply pipe leading to a pneumatic gauge, the changes in pressure as the workpiece is gauged indicating its dimensions. Each end of the lever 16, which is pivoted in a hole in a fixed block 2, carries a sapphire, and the knife-edge 28 is held by a spring strip 29 against an adjusting screw 33 by which the point of contact between knife-edge and lever may be varied. It is stated that a spigot and sleeve arrangement similar to that shown may replace the lower blade springs in the measuring device described in Specification 594,450.

MONSANTO CHEMICALS Ltd. 15 Sept., 1969 [11 Oct., 1968], No. 48239/68. Heading B5A. In the production of a foamed resin sheet a foamable composition is extruded through a slit die having a first zone 3 in which the required back pressure is set up, a second zone comprising a restriction 4 and having a relatively short land and a third zone 5 substantially without any internal obstruction and diverging to form the slit orifice. As shown, first zone 3 is defined by parallel opposing faces of die parts 1 and 2. Alternatively, this zone may converge in the direction of extrusion, see Figs. 4 and 5 (not reproduced). Second zone 4 preferably has a converging portion leading to the restriction when first zone 3 is parallel faced, but otherwise is preferably parallel faced as at (102), Figs. 4 and 5 (not shown). The faces of third zone 5 may be convex to the die axis as at (104, 105), Figs 4 and 5 (not shown). The extruded resin preferably passes through a pair of rollers, possibly spring urged together, whose nip is somewhat less than the final thickness of the sheet. The slit gap may vary over the width of the slit. The die is temperature controlled by passage of fluid, e.g. oil, water or steam through passages 14.

The die described with reference to Fig. 5 of Specification 1,034,120 is modified by the provision of passages 7 which run the length of the die and have outlets substantially centrally disposed of meshes 8 formed by slits 3-6. Foamable synthetic resin is extruded through passages 7 to subsequently expand and coalesce with similar resin extruded through slits 3-6, thereby forming a solid sheet or board. Some meshes 8 may have more than one passage outlet and others may have none. Slits 3-6 may form other than rectangular arrays with square meshes 8, e.g. a hexagon with triangular meshes, in each case the outlets of passages 7 preferably having a cross-sectional shape corresponding to their respective meshes. Passages 7 may have an effective diameter between 0À02-0À1 inch, slits 3-6 may have a width between 0À01-0À25 inch and a land between 0À1-0À5 inch and channels 2, which feed the slits, may have an effective diameter 1À3-10 times the width of the slits. The peripheral slits may have lands up to twice as long as those of the remaining slits. A board produced by the die may have a thickness between ¢ and 4 inches, a width which may exceed 60 inches and a density within the range 0À9-2 1b/cu. foot. Many thermoplastic resins are mentioned, those particularly preferred including polystyrene and polyethylene and the former may be modified with natural or synthetic rubber. Suitable blowing and nucleating agents are mentioned and two examples are given.

A foamable thermoplastic synthetic resin composition may be extruded through a die having at its inlet end a plurality of separate passages 2 communicating with a slit 3 at the outlet end of the die, the pressure within the die being sufficient to prevent the resin foaming before it leaves the slit and the dimensions of the passages 2 and of the slit 3 being such that the streams of resin issuing from the passages 2 fill the slit and coalesce whilst still in the unfoamed state. The resin may consist of a polymer or copolymer of a vinyl or vinylidene hydrocarbon monomer, e.g. ethylene, propylene, butadiene, styrene, vinyltoluene or a -methyl styrene, or a substituted monomer such as acrylonitrile, vinyl chloride or acetate, methyl acrylate or methacrylate, or ethyl acrylate. The foamable composition may contain as blowing agent a lower aliphatic hydrocarbon such as ethane, propane, butane, or pentane, a lower alkyl halide such as methyl chloride, trichloromethane or 1,2-dichlorotetrafluoroethane, an inorganic gas such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen, sodium or ammonium bicarbonate, or an organic nitrogen compound such as dinitrosopentamethylenediamine or barium azodicarboxylate.",MONSANTO CHEMICALS,BAXTER SAMUEL;;GILBERT JOHN HAROLD,,https://lens.org/113-487-228-382-960,Granted Patent,no,0,4,5,6,0,B29C44/468;;B29L2031/60;;B29C48/07;;B29C48/11;;B29C44/468;;B29L2031/60;;B29C48/11;;B29C48/07,B29C44/46;;B29C48/07;;B29C48/32,B5A A1G10         -;;B5A A1G3X         -;;B5A A1R14B        -;;C3C C104          104C;;C3C C104          158C;;C3C C107          104C;;C3C C107          158C;;C3C C110          104C;;C3C C110          158C;;C3C C150          104C;;C3C C150          158C;;C3C C153          104C;;C3C C153          158C;;C3C C156          104C;;C3C C156          158C;;C3C C162          104C;;C3C C162          158C;;C3C C164          C104;;C3C C181          104C;;C3C C181          158C;;C3C C350          104C;;C3C C350          158C;;C3C C358          104C;;C3C C358          158C;;C3C C522          104C;;C3C C522          158C;;C3P P10D1A        -;;C3P P2D1A1        -;;C3P P2D1A2        -;;C3P P4D3B1        -;;C3P P7D1A         -;;C3P P7D1C         -;;C3P P7D2A1        -;;C3P P7D2A2B       -;;C3P P7D2A4        -;;C3P P8D2A         -;;C3P P8D2B2        -;;C3P P8D3A         -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Aug. 27, 1964, No. 35182/64. Heading F2A. An airline lubricator has a housing 8 with an air-passage 9 therethrough which has a restriction intermediate its inlet and outlet ends 10, 11 so that, when air flows through the passage 9, a pressure drop is established across the restriction. A passage 41 in the housing communicates with the outlet end 11 through a valve unit 23 which opens when the pressure-drop across the restriction reaches or exceeds a predetermined value and admits pressurized lubricant to the outlet end 11 via the passage 41. In an embodiment, the lubricator 5, Fig. 1 (not shown), comprises an air supply structure 6 having the housing 8, and an attachment 7 having a body 13 with a flange 14 which is clamped by rings 16, 17 to the housing 8. A chamber 12 is formed in the housing 8 and is closed by the body 13 and a seal 15 is provided between the housing 8 and the body 13. A cap 18 is mounted on the housing 8 and has a vertical bore 22 therethrough which is aligned with a vertical bore 21 in the housing 8. Sealing rings 19, 20 are provided between the cap 18 and the housing 8 and a valve unit 23, having a body 24, is mounted in the bores 21, 22. The body is clamped within the housing 8 by a combined clamp and seal assembly 27; has a valve portion 28, Fig. 3 (not shown), located within the air passage 9 for controlling the flow of air therethrough so that there is a difference in pressure at the inlet 10 and outlet 11; and has a bore 29 therethrough which terminates at the lower end thereof in an enlarged bore 30. The latter receiving an upper end of a lubricant supply tube 31 which is retained by an 0-ring 32. A ball-valve 33 is provided to prevent the return of lubricant through the tube 31. The upper part of the body 24 has an enlarged bore 35 which receives an internallythreaded bushing 36 having a needle-valve 37 screwed therein which co-operates with an upper portion 37<SP>1</SP> of the bore 29 to control the volume of lubricant passing therethrough. The chamber 12 is supplied by air from the inlet end of the passage 9 via a passage 40. The housing 8 has the passage 41 therein which leads from the outlet end of the passage 9 to a chamber 42 in the cap 18; the chamber 42 being in communication with the bore 29 of the body 24 and with the tube 31, via passages 43 so that the lubricant is supplied to the air leaving the outlet 11. The pressure in the tube 31 corresponds to the pressure of the air at the outlet 11, thus there is a difference between the pressure in the chamber 12 and the pressure within the tube 31. The body 13 has a transverse bore 44 therein which receives a removable plug 45 and which is stepped at 47. A diaphragm 48 is clamped to the step 47 by the plug 45 being urged against a ring 49 to form a chamber 46 which connects, via a passage 56, the tube 31, the bore 29 and passages 43, to the chamber 42. The plug 45 has a chamber 50 therein which is effectively in opposition to the chamber 46 and which connects, via passages 53, 54 therein and a passage 52 in the body 13, with the chamber 12. Thus the air-pressure in the chambers 42, 46 are the same also the airpressure in the chambers 12, 50 are the same but are higher than the pressures in the chambers 42, 46. The flow of the lubricant is regulated by an adjustable screw-plug 71 which is received by a bore 69 in the plug 45 and which adjusts the diaphragm 48 via a spring 75. The diaphragm 48 is clamped by a washer 66 to a plunger 65 which engages a plunger 63 of a valve 62. Thus the flow of lubricant from an inlet 58 and a passage 61 is regulated and passed through the passage 56 and tube 31 &c. to the air-outlet passage 11. A filter 60 is provided in the inlet 58.

In practice, an air stream containing particulate matter from an industrial process is directed through an enclosure hood, through the particle separator and into the ventilation system. Relatively large particles are removed from the air stream in the particle separator before the air stream reaches the ventilation system. This reduces the abrasion and general damage that can occur from relatively large particles moving through the duct structure of a ventilation system.",AIR CONTROL TECHNIQUES P C,RICHARDS JOHN R;;GILBERT JONAS,AIR CONTROL TECHNIQUES P.C (2018-02-08),https://lens.org/110-193-223-261-665,Patent Application,yes,0,0,2,2,0,B01D45/06;;B01D45/06;;B01D45/02;;B01D45/04;;B07B7/086;;B65G69/18;;B65G69/20;;F24F13/28,B01D45/06;;F24F13/28,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
