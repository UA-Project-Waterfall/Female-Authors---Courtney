Multiple emergency alert signals are received by the encoder/decoder. A digital signal processor of the encoder/decoder scans the reception of the multiple emergency alert messages to determine the presence of an incoming emergency alert signal. The digital signal processor provides digital implementation of a frequency shift key modulation and a frequency shift key demodulation to encode and decode emergency alert messages. Additionally, the digital signal processor functions as a central processing unit to control input/output ports over a digital signal processor bus for performing all encoding and decoding functions and to control all encoding and decoding functions.",TFT INC,CRANDALL KENNETH;;FESLER KENNETH,TFT INC (1997-01-28),https://lens.org/132-089-189-540-334,Granted Patent,yes,10,117,1,1,0,G08B25/085;;G08B27/008;;H04H20/12;;H04H20/28;;H04H20/59;;H04L27/10;;H04H20/28;;H04L27/10;;G08B27/008;;G08B25/085;;H04H20/59;;H04H20/12,G08B25/08;;G08B27/00;;H04H20/28;;H04L27/10,375/272;;455/404;;455/521,2,0,,,"Article by Frederick M.

The single shots are each triggered upon receipt of a cycle edge to initiate an output pulse having a duration falling between the time intervals distinctive of the cycles of the two possible carrier signal frequencies. The next rising edge received by each causes the respective single shots to retrigger, and latches the previous output of each into the first element of an associated serial memory device. The successive elements of each of the serial memory devices, store the state output signals of adjacent cycles of the carrier signal, with the states in one of such devices being one-half cycle apart from the states in the other.
