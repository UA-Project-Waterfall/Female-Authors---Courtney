A pair of locking balls are confined about the locking rod and are operative to move outwardly for engagement with the shank of a tool holder in response to the locking rod moving from the unlocked position to the locked position. The lock rod of the present invention includes a variable sloped ramp for engagement with each locking ball. As each locking ball moves along the variable sloped locking ramp, the mechanical advantage applied to the locking balls through the ramp varies due to the variation in slope. Each locking ramp is particularly configured such that the resultant locking load exerted by the locking balls against the shank of the tool holder is relatively constant although the position of the locking rod and the force being applied to the locking rod varies.",KENNAMETAL INC,ERICKSON ROBERT,,https://lens.org/076-919-703-738-636,Granted Patent,no,0,0,15,16,0,B23B29/046;;B23B31/263;;F16B2/16;;Y10T407/227;;Y10T409/309464;;Y10T82/2585;;Y10T82/2589;;B23B29/04;;Y10T407/227;;Y10T409/309464;;Y10T82/2585;;Y10T82/2589;;B23B31/263;;B23B29/046;;F16B2/16,B23B29/04;;B23B29/00;;B23B31/02;;B23B31/107;;B23B31/117;;B23B31/22;;B23B31/26;;F16B2/16,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The lock rod of the present invention includes a variable sloped ramp for engagement with each locking ball. As each locking ball moves along the variable sloped locking ramp, the mechanical advantage applied to the locking balls through the ramp varies due to the variation in slope.

Precise rotational alignment of the tooling plate with the block is achieved by a peg extending from the vertical face of the block into a timing hole in the tooling plate spaced from the center hole thereof. The block, with workpiece-loaded tooling plates thereon, is lowered onto a rotary table so that a geometric axis of the block is perfectly aligned with the rotational axis of the rotary table. Rotational alignment of the block with the rotary table is achieved by mating of keys extending from the bottom of a base plate of the block into keyways in the surface of the rotary table. A numerically controlled machining device automatically machines each workpiece on the first tooling plate, causes rotation of the rotary table by 90 degrees, machines the workpieces on the second tooling plate, again indexes the rotary table 90 degrees, etc. After all workpieces have been machined, the block is lifted from the surface of the rotary table and immediately replaced with another block supporting four more workpiece-loaded tooling plates, which are being machined while the already-machined workpieces are removed from the first set of tooling plates.",ERICKSON ROBERT W,ERICKSON ROBERT W,,https://lens.org/168-980-164-307-324,Granted Patent,yes,8,37,1,1,0,B25B5/08;;B25B5/08;;B23Q3/103;;B23Q3/103;;Y10S269/90;;Y10S269/90;;Y10T409/30868;;Y10T409/30868;;Y10T409/309072;;Y10T409/309072,B23Q3/10,269/56;;269/71;;269/900;;409/219;;409/226,2,0,,,"The Mid State Tombstone , Mid State Machine Products, Inc., Advertisement in Modern Machine Shop, Jun. 1981, p. 250.;;Keys to Machining Center Palletization by Ken Gettelman, in Modern Machine Shop, Mar. 1982, pp. 61 64.",EXPIRED

The clamping apparatus (35) includes a housing (41), a pair of opposing locking spheres (57a, b) within the housing (41), a cylindrical canister member (39) mounted within the housing (41) that is matable with an insert-supporting tool unit (10) and which has a pair of opposing apertures (55a, b) in its sidewalls for conducting the locking spheres (57a, b) from a locking to an unlocking position, and a lock rod (60) reciprocally movable within the interior of the canister member (39) along an axis (A) and having opposing cam portions (64a, b) for radially moving the locking spheres (57a, b) through the canister apertures (55a, b) into wedging engagement with opposing angled walls (30) of sphere receiving openings (20) in the tool unit (10). To increase the mechanical advantage of the wedging action between the locking spheres (57a, b) and the angled walls (30) of the tool unit (10), the aperture walls (56) of the canister member (39) are angled with respect to a line (R) extending radially from the lock rod axis (A) to reduce the angle between the aperture wall (56) and the tool unit wall (30). Such angling increases the force of wedging and locking engagement between the locking spheres (57a, b) and the angled walls (30) of the tool unit (10). In the preferred embodiment, the aperture walls (56) are angled 15 degree with respect to the aforementioned radial line (R), thereby increasing the holding force of the clamping mechanism (35) by 30 percent.",KENNAMETAL INC,ERICKSON ALFRED ROBERT,,https://lens.org/005-504-361-902-212,Patent Application,no,0,0,23,23,0,B23B29/046;;B23B31/1071;;B23B31/30;;Y10T82/2585;;Y10T409/309408;;Y10T409/309464;;Y10T409/30952;;Y10T408/95;;Y10T279/1041;;Y10T82/2589;;Y10T82/2585;;Y10T409/309408;;Y10T409/309464;;Y10T409/30952;;Y10T408/95;;Y10T279/1041;;Y10T82/2589;;B23B31/1071;;B23B29/046;;B23B31/30,B23B29/00;;B23B29/04;;B23B31/02;;B23B31/107;;B23B31/117;;B23B31/30,,0,0,,,,PENDING

A pair of locking balls are confined about the locking rod and are operative to move outwardly for engagement with the shank of a tool holder in response to the locking rod moving from the unlocked position to the locked position. The lock rod of the present invention includes a variable sloped ramp for engagement with each locking ball. As each locking ball moves along the variable sloped locking ramp, the mechanical advantage applied to the locking balls through the ramp varies due to the variation in slope. Each locking ramp is particularly configured such that the resultant locking load exerted by the locking balls against the shank of the tool holder is relatively constant although the position of the locking rod and the force being applied to the locking rod varies.",KENNAMETAL INC,ERICKSON ROBERT A,,https://lens.org/005-965-154-975-322,Patent Application,no,0,0,15,16,0,B23B29/046;;B23B31/263;;F16B2/16;;Y10T407/227;;Y10T409/309464;;Y10T82/2585;;Y10T82/2589;;B23B29/04;;Y10T407/227;;Y10T409/309464;;Y10T82/2585;;Y10T82/2589;;B23B31/263;;B23B29/046;;F16B2/16,B23B29/00;;B23B29/04;;B23B31/02;;B23B31/107;;B23B31/117;;B23B31/22;;B23B31/26;;F16B2/16,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   An apparatus and method for clamping an insert in a tool holder includes a recess and a clamp pin with a lever portion having a curved surface at each end thereof. The recess includes an angled wall for engaging one of the curved surfaces of the lever portion. A wedge portion is disposed within the recess and operatively coupled to a lock screw such that rotation of the lock screw causes movement of the wedge portion in a first direction. A biasing force is applied to the lever portion to cause the clamp pin to move in a second direction that is different than the first direction. The wedge portion includes one or more angled walls for engaging one of the curved surfaces of the lever portion. Movement of the wedge portion in the first direction causes the angled wall of the recess to act as a cam surface to cause the clamp pin to pivot about a pivot point, P, located along a central axis of the clamp pin.

This overall improvement in moisture content greatly increases th e edgewise bending strength for stability-kerfed construction lumber by comparison to that for contemporary construction lumber. Its improved moisture condition at the time of entry into the marketing stre am also fosters future dimensional stability compared to that for contemporary lumber.

However, the rotating carrier (14), wedge surface (26) and cam surface (52) are disposed and shaped such that the cam surface (52) and wedge surface (26) will, under the influence of the lock rod, move to a wedged self-locking position after the lock rod (50) has assumed a locked position. The driver (16) is designed with respect to the rotating carrier (14), wedge surface (26), and cam surface (52) such that the driver (16) will rotate the cam surface (52) and wedge surface (26) with respect to each other such that they are moved from a wedged locked position and thereafter the rotating carrier (14), wedge surface (26), and cam surface (52) can be rotated in unison as the lock rod (50) itself is rotated from the locked position to the unlocked position.",KENNAMETAL INC,ERICKSON ROBERT A,,https://lens.org/107-797-510-827-616,Patent Application,no,0,0,11,11,0,B25B23/00;;F16B13/0891;;F16B21/02;;F16B39/02;;Y10S411/947;;Y10T29/49881;;B23B31/1612;;B23B29/04;;B23B31/1612;;Y10T29/49881;;F16B21/02;;B25B23/00;;F16B13/0891;;F16B39/02;;Y10S411/947;;B23B31/1612,B23B29/04;;B23B31/107;;B23B31/22;;B25B23/00;;F16B13/08;;F16B21/02;;F16B39/02;;F16B39/22,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

A toolholder having an insert pocket with a movable insert seat therein is utilized with the insert cartridge. A reciprocably movable drawbar moves the insert seat in the toolholder pocket back and forth so as to clamp and unclamp a cutting insert. When it is signaled to change the insert, the drawbar moves the insert seat out of the insert pocket, thereby unclamping the insert. The insert is then removed from the insert seat and the insert storage cartridge is positioned in proper alignment with the toolholder. The cartridge and toolholder are then engaged so that the insert seat engages the dispensing means on the cartridge unit. The drawbar is then actuated so that the insert seat is moved inwardly into the pocket of the toolholder, thereby taking an insert from the storage chamber of the insert cartridge and clamping it in the insert pocket of the toolholder.

In the clamping apparatus, the canister member apertures are elongated along the stroke axis. This allows the spherical locking elements to move axially along the cam portions of the lock rod as well as radially, such that locking engagement can be achieved with a shorter axial stroke movement of the lock rod. The aperture walls may also be angled to allow even greater axial movement of the locking elements, which not only further shortens the lock rod stroke, but can increase the gripping force that the clamping apparatus applies to the tool unit. The shorter lock rod stroke in turn advantageously shortens the tool envelope, and increases both the rigidity and life of the spring package that withdraws the lock rod.

    Methods and apparatuses for designing a plurality of integrated circuits (ICs) from a language representation of hardware. In one example of a method, a technology independent RTL (register transfer level) netlist is partitioned between representations of a plurality of ICs. In a typical example of the method, a hardware description language (HDL) code is written and compiled without regard to splitting the design among multiple ICs. After compilation, a partition of the technology independent RTL netlist, obtained from the compilation, is performed among the multiple ICs. After a partition, the technology independent RTh netlist is mapped to a particular target technology (e.g. a particular IC vendor's architecture for implementing logic circuitry), and place and route tools may be used to create the design in multiple ICs (e.g. field programmable gate arrays). Other examples of methods and apparatuses are described.

   Methods and apparatuses for designing a plurality of integrated circuits (ICs) from a language representation of hardware. In one example of a method, a technology independent RTL (register transfer level) netlist is partitioned between representations of a plurality of ICs. In a typical example of the method, a hardware description language (HDL) code is written and compiled without regard to splitting the design among multiple ICs. After compilation, a partition of the technology independent RTL netlist, obtained from the compilation, is performed among the multiple ICs. After a partition, the technology independent RTL netlist is mapped to a particular target technology (e.g. a particular IC vendor's architecture for implementing logic circuitry), and place and route tools may be used to create the design in multiple ICs (e.g. field programmable gate arrays). In an example of another method, an HDL code is compiled to produce an RTL netlist representation which specifies a plurality of ICs in which logic, designed for placement on one of the plurality of ICs, is replicated for placement on another one of the plurality of ICs. In a typical example of this method, the HDL code is written and compiled without regard to splitting the design among multiple ICs and a partition operation is performed on the RTL netlist from the results of the compiled HDL code. The partition operation produces multiple ICs and selected logic may then be replicated on the multiple ICs. In an example of another method, an HDL code is compiled to produce an RTL netlist representation which includes at least one RTL component. The one RTL component is split into multiple RTL components, each of which is designed for placement on a separate IC.

   Methods and apparatuses for designing a plurality of integrated circuits (ICs) from a language representation of hardware. In one example of a method, a technology independent RTL (register transfer level) netlist is partitioned between representations of a plurality of ICs. In a typical example of the method, a hardware description language (HDL) code is written and compiled without regard to splitting the design among multiple ICs. After compilation, a partition of the technology independent RTL netlist, obtained from the compilation, is performed among the multiple ICs. After a partition, the technology independent RTL netlist is mapped to a particular target technology (e.g. a particular IC vendor's architecture for implementing logic circuitry), and place and route tools may be used to create the design in multiple ICs (e.g. field programmable gate arrays). In an example of another method, an HDL code is compiled to produce an RTL netlist representation which specifies a plurality of ICs in which logic, designed for placement on one of the plurality of ICs, is replicated for placement on another one of the plurality of ICs. In a typical example of this method, the HDL code is written and compiled without regard to splitting the design among multiple ICs and a partition operation is performed on the RTL netlist from the results of the compiled HDL code. The partition operation produces multiple ICs and selected logic may then be replicated on the multiple ICs. In an example of another method, an HDL code is compiled to produce an RTL netlist representation which includes at least one RTL component. The one RTL component is split into multiple RTL components, each of which is designed for placement on a separate IC.

    Methods and apparatuses for designing a plurality of integrated circuits (ICs) from a language representation of hardware. In one example of a method, a technology independent RTL (register transfer level) netlist is partitioned between representations of a plurality of ICs. In a typical example of the method, a hardware description language (HDL) code is written and compiled without regard to splitting the design among multiple ICs. After compilation, a partition of the technology independent RTL netlist, obtained from the compilation, is performed among the multiple ICs. After a partition, the technology independent RTL netlist is mapped to a particular target technology (e.g. a particular IC vendor's architecture for implementing logic circuitry), and place and route tools may be used to create the design in multiple ICs (e.g. field programmable gate arrays). In an example of another method, an HDL code is compiled to produce an RTL netlist representation which specifies a plurality of ICs in which logic, designed for placement on one of the plurality of ICs, is replicated for placement on another one of the plurality of ICs. In a typical example of this method, the HDL code is written and compiled without regard to splitting the design among multiple ICs and a partition operation is performed on the RTL netlist from the results of the compiled HDL code. The partition operation produces multiple ICs and selected logic may then be replicated on the multiple ICs. In an example of another method, an HDL code is compiled to produce an RTL netlist representation which includes at least one RTL component. The one RTL component is split into multiple RTL components, each of which is designed for placement on a separate IC.

The electrosurgical generator may control the power during a cycle, and react to a change in power if arcing occurs. Voltage sources, especially, demonstrate the tendency to have large, uncontrolled power excursions during normal electrosurgical use. The magnitude of the power excursions may be dependent on various factors. An exemplary electrosurgical generator control scheme reduces or minimizes the thermal spread by accurately supplying the specified power within a few cycles. Additionally, fast and accurate regulation provided by the constant voltage mode reduces or minimizes unintentional tissue charring. Thus, reduced thermal spread and charring should result in better surgical outcomes by reducing scarring and decreasing healing times. An electrosurgical generator controller may be configured to control both a DC-DC buck converter and a DC-AC boost inverter based in part on electrical parameters of the electrosurgical generator. 100 103 102 101 DC-DC DC-AC Vout 104 Buck Boost -- | urrent-Mo de 13112 _Conr trg91- Voltage-Mode Controller )Comensato -vLtt) 110 - 1 -_ _ _ - I -- -___ __--_ _-__ -_-__- __-_- 11 Figure 1 |1imit_2- Aa rp Ct I V g Vma Vma RMS Voltage Figure 2",UNIV COLORADO,FRIEDRICHS DANIEL;;ERICKSON ROBERT;;GILBERT JAMES,THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO; TYCO HE (2015-09-03),https://lens.org/058-031-435-841-930,Patent Application,no,0,0,18,18,0,A61B18/1206;;A61B18/1206;;A61B2018/00607;;A61B2018/00648;;A61B2018/00678;;A61B2018/00678;;A61B2018/0069;;A61B2018/0072;;A61B2018/00726;;A61B2018/00726;;A61B2018/00767;;A61B2018/00779;;A61B2018/00779;;A61B2018/00827;;A61B2018/00827;;A61B2018/00875;;A61B2018/00892;;A61B2018/00892;;A61B2018/1266;;A61B2018/1286;;H02M1/007;;H02M1/007;;H02M7/53871;;H02M7/53871,A61B18/10;;A61B18/18;;H02M1/00;;H02M7/5387,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The second taper angle is different than the first taper angle such that an interference fit between the shank and the inner surface of the adapter sleeve forces the outer surface of the adapter sleeve into positive contact with a tapered bore of a spindle of the rotary tapered tool holder.",KENNAMETAL INC,ERICKSON ROBERT A;;MASSA TED R,KENNAMETAL INC (2005-12-14),https://lens.org/031-167-021-226-885,Granted Patent,yes,37,15,6,6,0,B23B31/006;;B23B31/006;;B23B2231/0272;;B23B2231/0272;;B23B2231/0288;;B23B2231/0288;;B23B2231/22;;B23B2231/22;;B23B2260/136;;B23B2260/136;;Y10T279/17965;;Y10T279/17965;;Y10T408/95;;Y10T408/95;;Y10T408/957;;Y10T408/957;;Y10T409/309408;;Y10T409/309408;;Y10T409/30952;;Y10T409/30952,B23C5/26,409/234;;409/232;;279/103;;X408239 A;;X408239 R,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The electrosurgical generator may control the power during a cycle, and react to a change in power if arcing occurs. Voltage sources, especially, demonstrate the tendency to have large, uncontrolled power excursions during normal electrosurgical use. The magnitude of the power excursions may be dependent on various factors. An exemplary electrosurgical generator control scheme reduces or minimizes the thermal spread by accurately supplying the specified power within a few cycles. Additionally, fast and accurate regulation provided by the constant voltage mode reduces or minimizes unintentional tissue charring. Thus, reduced thermal spread and charring should result in better surgical outcomes by reducing scarring and decreasing healing times. An electrosurgical generator controller may be configured to control both a DC-DC buck converter and a DC-AC boost inverter based in part on electrical parameters of the electrosurgical generator.",UNIV COLORADO REGENTS,FRIEDRICHS DANIEL;;ERICKSON ROBERT;;GILBERT JAMES,,https://lens.org/061-793-666-027-716,Patent Application,no,0,0,18,18,0,A61B2018/00678;;A61B2018/00726;;A61B2018/00779;;A61B2018/00827;;A61B2018/00892;;A61B18/1206;;H02M7/53871;;H02M1/007;;A61B2018/00678;;A61B2018/00726;;A61B2018/00779;;A61B2018/00827;;A61B2018/00892;;H02M1/007;;A61B18/1206;;H02M7/53871;;A61B2018/00607;;A61B2018/00648;;A61B2018/0069;;A61B2018/0072;;A61B2018/00767;;A61B2018/00875;;A61B2018/1266;;A61B2018/1286,A61B18/12;;A61B17/32;;H02M1/00;;H02M3/04;;H02M7/44;;H02M7/5387,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The electrosurgical generator may control the power during a cycle, and react to a change in power if arcing occurs. Voltage sources, especially, demonstrate the tendency to have large, uncontrolled power excursions during normal electrosurgical use. The magnitude of the power excursions may be dependent on various factors. An exemplary electrosurgical generator control scheme reduces or minimizes the thermal spread by accurately supplying the specified power within a few cycles. Additionally, fast and accurate regulation provided by the constant voltage mode reduces or minimizes unintentional tissue charring. Thus, reduced thermal spread and charring should result in better surgical outcomes by reducing scarring and decreasing healing times. An electrosurgical generator controller may be configured to control both a DC-DC buck converter and a DC-AC boost inverter based in part on electrical parameters of the electrosurgical generator.",FRIEDRICHS DANIEL;;ERICKSON ROBERT;;GILBERT JAMES;;UNIV COLORADO REGENTS;;COVIDIEN LP,FRIEDRICHS DANIEL;;ERICKSON ROBERT;;GILBERT JAMES,COVIDIEN LP (2009-01-05);;THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO A BODY CORPORATE (2012-02-24);;TYCO HEALTHCARE GROUP LP D/B/A COVIDIEN (2009-01-05),https://lens.org/171-924-809-809-842,Granted Patent,yes,12,2,18,18,0,A61B18/1206;;A61B18/1206;;A61B2018/00607;;A61B2018/00648;;A61B2018/00678;;A61B2018/00678;;A61B2018/0069;;A61B2018/0072;;A61B2018/00726;;A61B2018/00726;;A61B2018/00767;;A61B2018/00779;;A61B2018/00779;;A61B2018/00827;;A61B2018/00827;;A61B2018/00875;;A61B2018/00892;;A61B2018/00892;;A61B2018/1266;;A61B2018/1286;;H02M1/007;;H02M1/007;;H02M7/53871;;H02M7/53871,A61B18/00;;A61B18/12;;H02M1/00;;H02M7/5387,,10,1,063-113-052-529-376,10.1109/apec.1999.750495,"Maxim Integrated, ""MAX 5073 Dual-Output Buck or Boost Converter with Internal Power MOSFETs"", https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX5073.pdfcaptured Jan. 11, 2005.;;Google Archive search, demonstrating search result for MAX 5073 data sheet online on Jan. 11, 2005.;;IP Australia; Patent Examination Report mailed Aug, 2, 2013 in corresponding Australian App. No. 2011265566.;;Partial European Search Report dated Oct. 14, 2014 for EP App. No. 11195600.9.;;Zhang Kai et al: ""Deadbeat control of PWM inverter with repetitive disturbance prediction""; Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 1999, APEC '99.

In the clamping apparatus, the canister member apertures are elongated along the stroke axis. This allows the spherical locking elements to move axially along the cam portions of the lock rod as well as radially, such that locking engagement can be achieved with a shorter axial stroke movement of the lock rod. The aperture walls may also be angled to allow even greater axial movement of the locking elements, which not only further shortens the lock rod stroke, but can increase the gripping force that the clamping apparatus applies to the tool unit. The shorter lock rod stroke in turn advantageously shortens the tool envelope, and increases both the rigidity and life of the spring package that withdraws the lock rod.

The electrosurgical generator may control the power during a cycle, and react to a change in power if arcing occurs. Voltage sources, especially, demonstrate the tendency to have large, uncontrolled power excursions during normal electrosurgical use. The magnitude of the power excursions may be dependent on various factors. An exemplary electrosurgical generator control scheme reduces or minimizes the thermal spread by accurately supplying the specified power within a few cycles. Additionally, fast and accurate regulation provided by the constant voltage mode reduces or minimizes unintentional tissue charring. Thus, reduced thermal spread and charring should result in better surgical outcomes by reducing scarring and decreasing healing times. An electrosurgical generator controller may be configured to control both a DC-DC buck converter and a DC-AC boost inverter based in part on electrical parameters of the electrosurgical generator.

This allows the spherical locking elements to move axially along the cam portions of the lock rod as well as radially, such that locking engagement can be achieved with a shorter axial stroke movement of the lock rod. The aperture walls may also be angled to allow even greater axial movement of the locking elements, which not only further shortens the lock rod stroke, but can increase the gripping force that the clamping apparatus applies to the tool unit. The shorter lock rod stroke in turn advantageously shortens the tool envelope, and increases both the rigidity and life of the spring package that withdraws the lock rod.

The electrosurgical generator may control the power during a cycle, and react to a change in power if arcing occurs. Voltage sources, especially, demonstrate the tendency to have large, uncontrolled power excursions during normal electrosurgical use. The magnitude of the power excursions may be dependent on various factors. An exemplary electrosurgical generator control scheme reduces or minimizes the thermal spread by accurately supplying the specified power within a few cycles. Additionally, fast and accurate regulation provided by the constant voltage mode reduces or minimizes unintentional tissue charring. Thus, reduced thermal spread and charring should result in better surgical outcomes by reducing scarring and decreasing healing times. An electrosurgical generator controller may be configured to control both a DC-DC buck converter and a DC-AC boost inverter based in part on electrical parameters of the electrosurgical generator. 100 103 102 101 DC-DC DC-AC Vout 104 Buck Boost -- | urrent-Mo de 13112 _Conr trg91- Voltage-Mode Controller )Comensato -vLtt) 110 - 1 -_ _ _ - I -- -___ __--_ _-__ -_-__- __-_- 11 Figure 1 |1imit_2- Aa rp Ct I V g Vma Vma RMS Voltage Figure 2",UNIV COLORADO REGENTS;;TYCO HEALTHCARE GROUP LP D/B/A COVIDIEN,FRIEDRICHS DANIEL;;ERICKSON ROBERT;;GILBERT JAMES,THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO; TYCO HE (2015-09-03),https://lens.org/128-898-366-385-490,Granted Patent,no,5,0,18,18,0,A61B18/1206;;A61B18/1206;;A61B2018/00607;;A61B2018/00648;;A61B2018/00678;;A61B2018/00678;;A61B2018/0069;;A61B2018/0072;;A61B2018/00726;;A61B2018/00726;;A61B2018/00767;;A61B2018/00779;;A61B2018/00779;;A61B2018/00827;;A61B2018/00827;;A61B2018/00875;;A61B2018/00892;;A61B2018/00892;;A61B2018/1266;;A61B2018/1286;;H02M1/007;;H02M1/007;;H02M7/53871;;H02M7/53871,A61B18/10;;A61B18/18;;H02M1/00;;H02M7/00;;H02M7/5387;;H02M11/00,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The electrosurgical generator may control the power during a cycle, and react to a change in power if arcing occurs. Voltage sources, especially, demonstrate the tendency to have large, uncontrolled power excursions during normal electrosurgical use. The magnitude of the power excursions may be dependent on various factors. An exemplary electrosurgical generator control scheme reduces or minimizes the thermal spread by accurately supplying the specified power within a few cycles. Additionally, fast and accurate regulation provided by the constant voltage mode reduces or minimizes unintentional tissue charring. Thus, reduced thermal spread and charring should result in better surgical outcomes by reducing scarring and decreasing healing times. An electrosurgical generator controller may be configured to control both a DC-DC buck converter and a DC-AC boost inverter based in part on electrical parameters of the electrosurgical generator.",FRIEDRICHS DANIEL;;ERICKSON ROBERT;;GILBERT JAMES;;UNIV COLORADO REGENTS,FRIEDRICHS DANIEL;;ERICKSON ROBERT;;GILBERT JAMES,COVIDIEN LP (2009-01-05);;THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO A BODY CORPORATE (2012-02-24);;TYCO HEALTHCARE GROUP LP D/B/A COVIDIEN (2009-01-05),https://lens.org/172-811-546-433-745,Patent Application,yes,2,52,18,18,0,A61B18/1206;;A61B18/1206;;A61B2018/00607;;A61B2018/00648;;A61B2018/00678;;A61B2018/00678;;A61B2018/0069;;A61B2018/0072;;A61B2018/00726;;A61B2018/00726;;A61B2018/00767;;A61B2018/00779;;A61B2018/00779;;A61B2018/00827;;A61B2018/00827;;A61B2018/00875;;A61B2018/00892;;A61B2018/00892;;A61B2018/1266;;A61B2018/1286;;H02M1/007;;H02M1/007;;H02M7/53871;;H02M7/53871,A61B18/00;;H02M1/00;;H02M7/5387,606/38,2,0,,,"Maxim Integrated, ""MAX 5073 Dual-Output Buck or Boost Converter with Internal Power MOSFETs"", https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX5073.pdfcaptured Jan 11, 2005.;;Google Archive search, demonstrating search result for MAX 5073 data sheet online on Jan 11, 2005",ACTIVE

As a result, the controller is able to alter the effective separation and area of the active electrode, in response to resistivity variations to provide optimal operation.",WATER REGENERATION SYSTEMS INC;;ERICKSON ROBERT K;;PRINZ FRANCOIS X,ERICKSON ROBERT K;;PRINZ FRANCOIS X,,https://lens.org/163-237-919-016-451,Patent Application,yes,4,21,9,9,0,C02F1/008;;C02F1/46104;;C02F1/46109;;C02F2001/46133;;C02F2001/46152;;C02F2201/4611;;C02F2201/46125;;C02F2209/006;;C02F2209/05;;C02F2303/04;;C02F1/46104;;C02F1/008;;C02F1/46109;;C02F2001/46133;;C02F2001/46152;;C02F2201/4611;;C02F2201/46125;;C02F2209/006;;C02F2209/05;;C02F2303/04;;C02F1/46104;;C02F2001/46133;;C02F1/008;;C02F1/46109;;C02F2001/46152;;C02F2209/006;;C02F2209/05;;C02F2201/4611;;C02F2303/04;;C02F2201/46125,C02F1/00;;C02F1/461;;C02F1/48;;C02F1/46,,1,0,,,See also references of EP 0646278A4,PENDING

In the clamping apparatus, the canister member apertures are elongated along the stroke axis. This allows the spherical locking elements to move axially along the cam portions of the lock rod as well as radially, such that locking engagement can be achieved with a shorter axial stroke movement of the lock rod. The aperture walls may also be angled to allow even greater axial movement of the locking elements, which not only further shortens the lock rod stroke, but can increase the gripping force that the clamping apparatus applies to the tool unit. The shorter lock rod stroke in turn advantageously shortens the tool envelope, and increases both the rigidity and life of the spring package that withdraws the lock rod.

In the clamping apparatus, the canister member apertures are elongated along the stroke axis. This allows the spherical locking elements to move axially along the cam portions of the lock rod as well as radially, such that locking engagement can be achieved with a shorter axial stroke movement of the lock rod. The aperture walls may also be angled to allow even greater axial movement of the locking elements, which not only further shortens the lock rod stroke, but can increase the gripping force that the clamping apparatus applies to the tool unit. The shorter lock rod stroke in turn advantageously shortens the tool envelope, and increases both the rigidity and life of the spring package that withdraws the lock rod.

This allows the spherical locking elements to move axially along the cam portions of the lock rod as well as radially, such that locking engagement can be achieved with a shorter axial stroke movement of the lock rod. The aperture walls may also be angled to allow even greater axial movement of the locking elements, which not only further shortens the lock rod stroke, but can increase the gripping force that the clamping apparatus applies to the tool unit. The shorter lock rod stroke in turn advantageously shortens the tool envelope, and increases both the rigidity and life of the spring package that withdraws the lock rod.

The electrosurgical generator may control the power during a cycle, and react to a change in power if arcing occurs. Voltage sources, especially, demonstrate the tendency to have large, uncontrolled power excursions during normal electrosurgical use. The magnitude of the power excursions may be dependent on various factors. An exemplary electrosurgical generator control scheme reduces or minimizes the thermal spread by accurately supplying the specified power within a few cycles. Additionally, fast and accurate regulation provided by the constant voltage mode reduces or minimizes unintentional tissue charring. Thus, reduced thermal spread and charring should result in better surgical outcomes by reducing scarring and decreasing healing times. An electrosurgical generator controller may be configured to control both a DC-DC buck converter and a DC-AC boost inverter based in part on electrical parameters of the electrosurgical generator.
