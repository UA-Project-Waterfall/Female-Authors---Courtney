Pulleys.-Relates to grooved pulleys chiefly designed for wire-rope transmission. The pulley is composed of two discs a, b with inter-engaging toothed flanges c, d, which form the tread. The discs are shown mounted on the ends of separate shafts h, and are drawn together by plates k and a boltj, or by overlapping cross-bars. The pull of the rope causes the discs to approach each other and grip it. Fig. 5 shows a modification, in which a plain flange on one disc fits in a groove in the other. When used in a continuous shaft, the discs are formed with long sleeve bosses, the outer ends of which fit over squares on the shaft and are driven by collars, or the ends may be toothed to engage with toothed collars. The shaft may be reduced in diameter between the collars, to allow it to spring.",EDWARDS JOHN;;EDWARDS RICHARD,EDWARDS JOHN;;EDWARDS RICHARD,,https://lens.org/164-237-154-393-365,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

[Also in Group XXII] A strain gauge comprises a series of parallel tensioned resistance wires connected in series by low-resistance transverse ribbons spot welded to the wires. In manufacturing such a gauge a gauge frame 10 (Fig. 4) comprising a section 15 which upon removal of locking pin 17 is pressed outwards by spring 16 is located in the position shown (Fig. 1) on platform 7 between guiding wires 13, 14 and wire is drawn off spools 3 between the guiding wires to the position shown. After the wires have been fixed to the movable section and opposite end of the gauge frame by adhesive plaster, the frame is replaced by a similar frame and itself removed to the second position on platform 7 thereby drawing the wires over the second frame. After the wires have been fixed to the second frame the wires are severed between the frames and the process repeated. Ribbons are then spot welded to the wires to connect them in series and the gauge frame placed wires downwards over a sheet of paper 29 (Fig. 7) on a base 27 of polytetrafluorethylene. A second paper sheet 28 is placed over the wires and the locking pin 17 removed to tension the wires which are then bonded to the paper sheets by a synthetic resin. If the gauge is for use at high temperatures the wires are bonded between sheets of woven glass cloth by a ceramic cement.

Therefore, a web-based single sign-on scheme can operate over HTTP to authorize data-processing services, such as web-filtering services.",SCANSAFE LTD,EDWARDS JOHN,SCANSAFE LIMITED (2009-10-08);;CISCO TECHNOLOGY INC (2020-10-22),https://lens.org/163-664-734-311-434,Patent Application,yes,43,71,2,11,0,H04L63/0428;;H04L63/083;;H04L67/561;;H04L63/083;;H04L63/0428;;H04L67/561,G06F15/177;;G06F15/16;;H04L9/32,713/168;;709/203;;709/227;;709/222,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The aggregate has its own physical volume block number (pvbn) space and maintains metadata, such as block allocation structures, within that pvbn space. Each vvol also has its own virtual volume block number (vvbn) space and maintains metadata, such as block allocation structures, within that vvbn space. The inventive technique extends input/output efficiencies of the conventional write allocation procedure to comport with an extended file system layout of the storage system.",NETWORK APPLIANCE INC,EDWARDS JOHN K,NETWORK APPLIANCE (2004-07-15);;NETAPP INC (2008-03-10),https://lens.org/037-839-982-975-284,Granted Patent,yes,40,20,14,14,0,G06F3/061;;G06F3/064;;G06F3/067;;G06F16/188;;G06F16/13;;G06F16/188;;G06F16/13;;G06F3/061;;G06F3/064;;G06F3/067;;Y10S707/99952;;Y10S707/99943;;Y10S707/99953;;Y10S707/99956;;G06F3/0604;;G06F3/0631;;G06F3/0689,G06F17/30,707/205;;707/100;;707/102;;707/201;;707/202;;707/204,91,28,084-963-980-784-647;;065-644-162-769-886;;144-144-484-946-50X;;147-109-563-054-804;;072-680-043-192-49X;;063-676-340-028-09X;;073-803-873-780-366;;042-984-932-165-592;;005-596-589-846-940;;145-076-466-874-682;;150-234-170-607-309;;062-220-644-824-624;;185-822-237-193-923;;187-552-317-537-20X;;070-852-624-143-237;;034-082-828-628-654;;138-384-758-933-032;;115-653-650-342-968;;073-803-873-780-366;;035-297-134-619-360;;118-803-795-491-26X;;046-401-738-237-255;;024-408-381-267-024;;034-503-924-328-160;;110-333-611-078-805;;111-691-277-637-654;;003-969-461-063-513;;106-800-948-100-241,10.1109/icpads.2001.934859;;10.21236/ada197007;;10.1145/356842.356847;;10.1145/319996.320002;;10.1109/32.4635;;10.1145/146941.146942;;10.1145/320521.320540;;10.1145/50202.50214;;10.1002/spe.4380211203;;10.1007/978-1-4615-2221-8;;10.21236/ada604306;;10.1145/146941.146943;;10.1145/272682.272717;;10.1145/98460.98509;;10.1147/sj.283.0407;;10.1145/76372.76378;;10.1016/b978-0-932376-22-0.50013-2;;10.1145/93605.98744;;10.1145/320521.320540;;10.1109/mass.1993.289764;;10.1145/323627.323634;;10.1145/121132.286600;;10.1145/323647.323633;;10.1146/annurev.cs.04.060190.000445;;10.1109/wwos.1989.109279;;10.1109/12.54838;;10.1109/2.53351;;10.21236/ada611544,"Chang-Soo Kim et al., Volume Management in SAN Environment, Parallel and Distrobute Systems, 2001.

    A mulching unit for a mulching apparatus includes at least one cutting assembly or hammer having a rotatable support element and two cutting elements spaced apart from one another by a predetermined gap that allows debris to pass between the cutting elements, thereby increasing efficiency and enabling higher rotating speeds for sustained amounts of time. The cutting elements include tips that may be formed in one piece with the support element, e.g., a collar, and the tips may be covered with a protective layer of tungsten and/or carbide. Alternatively, the tips themselves can be made from tungsten and/or carbide and physically attached, e.g., by welding, to the collar to form an integral unit. The cutting elements may be mounted on support element halves that can independently rotate on a support rod of the mulching unit.

The lid portion of the rotor is a generally flat circular disc with the thicker rim portion of greater mass located around the periphery of the circular disc. The slight deflection of the lid during centrifugation provides an automatic increase in the seal between the lid and the lower portion of the rotor as the rotational speed increases. The automatic tightening feature enables the user to merely hand tighten the lid onto the lower portion of the rotor without having to use some type of mechanical advantage tool. The lid has a relatively large diameter and contains no holes in order to reduce possible material stress in the lid during centrifugation.

J. Jan. 7. Electric traction on the overhead - conductor system. Collectors.-Relates to the means described in Specification No. 19,150, A.D. 1906, for automatically retracting the trolly poles of electric cars. According to the present invention, the sleeve g is extended to the bottom of the case a so as to rest normally in the bearing g<1>, and the control rope l is attached to a rod p carrying a cone - shaped weight r, adapted to move freely within the sleeve and serving to keep the trolly rope taut. This weight is formed with projecting arms s which work in slots t formed in the sleeve. A helical spring u, surrounding the rod p, rests on the cone weight and carries a bar w having pivoted depending hooks x. Normally, the rod p and its appendages work freely in the sleeve ; but, when the rope is jerked quickly, the spring is compressed, and the cone surface of the weight forces the hooks x into engagement with the sleeve g. The movement of the sleeve then liberates the weight b, which, in falling, engages with the arms s and retracts the collector. It is stated in the Provisional Specification that the upper surface of the cone weight is grooved at points beneath the hooks and that, where the length of the sleeve is not sufficient to allow for the necessary free movement of the rope, the rope may be looped through the top of the rod and its free end secured to a fixed point on the car.",EDWARDS ALFRED JOHN,EDWARDS ALFRED JOHN,,https://lens.org/115-888-632-038-571,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The apparatus including a dolly (71) positionable by drive means along an extensible track arrangement (72), having a camera (73) mounted thereto and provided with motors to orientate the camera (73) by varying its pan (76), tilt (75), and roll (74). An operator interface device (15) is used to define position and velocity characteristics of the desired motion of each of the camera's axes of motion and a motor driver module (69) calculates a parametric cubic polynomial representation of the desired motion curve. The calculated coefficients of the motion curve parametric cubic polynomial representation are easily stored and used to regenerate the values of the curve for the purposes of display and providing motion curve values for each axis of motion of the camera. These calculations can be performed upon command and in real-time. Motion curve characteristics may be modified by way of redefining the position and velocity parameters and the values generated by a curve generator (50 ) may be digitally processed by a signal processing module (57). A variety of signal processing functions may be performed upon the motion curve values generated, including summation, filtering and multiplication. Digital values representative of random, periodic and aperiodic signals may be combined with each of the motion curves generated. Additionally, values of camera characteristics such as focus, film pull-down rates, shutter speed, etc. are recorded for reproduction in synchronism with the replay of the camera motion. The provision of a camera motion control apparatus having the described facilities, enables accurate repeatability of camera motion and scene recording for digital image integration to real-life recordings, multiple time scale motion and film recording techniques for special effects.",DIGITAL ARTS FILM AND TELEVISI,EDWARDS JOHN R,,https://lens.org/056-356-700-377-159,Granted Patent,yes,15,68,7,7,0,F16M11/18;;G05B19/4093;;G05B19/416;;G05B19/42;;G05B2219/34047;;G05B2219/36171;;G05B2219/36495;;G05B2219/45176;;H04N5/222;;F16M11/10;;F16M11/105;;F16M11/2014;;F16M11/2021;;F16M11/2085;;F16M11/28;;F16M11/425;;F16M13/027;;F16M2200/044;;H04N23/62;;H04N23/695;;G05B19/4093;;G05B19/416;;G05B2219/36171;;H04N5/222;;G05B19/42;;G05B2219/36495;;G05B2219/45176;;F16M11/18;;G05B2219/34047;;F16M11/2085;;F16M11/2021;;F16M2200/044;;F16M11/425;;F16M11/105;;F16M11/2014;;F16M11/28;;F16M13/027;;F16M11/10;;H04N23/62;;H04N23/695,B25J9/18;;G03B15/00;;F16M11/18;;F16M11/42;;G05B19/4093;;G05B19/41;;G05B19/416;;G05B19/42;;G05D3/00;;H04N5/222;;H04N5/232,318/571;;318/572;;318/573;;364/169;;364/474.11,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Currently popular consumer grade electrostatic air filters accumulate suspended contaminants onto accumulation plates which require subsequent disposal or cleaning of the highly concentrated contaminates, a maintenance requirement that presents a new consumer health risk. Disclosed is a technology with several embodiments that structurally sequester and eradicate suspended particulates by electrostatically migrating them to an internal photocatalytic dismantling grid. The grid is a multicellular foundation of tetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) or Teflon-coated metal, with an outer layer of photocatalytic nanocrystals embedded in a durable, porous coating that is energized by ultraviolet radiation to create powerful surface dismantling agents thereon, including hydroxyl radicals, from natural elements in ambient air. Pathogens, mycotoxins, spores, odor molecules, allergens, smoke particles, and industrial pollutants are structurally dissociated into harmless protein fragments and natural molecules when they encounter the dismantling grid. The decontamination phenomenon is amplified by using the natural or enhanced positive or negative electrostatic surface charge on the suspended particles to migrate them to the dismantling grid for photocatalytic destruction. Contaminants, suspended water molecules, and trace ozone ions are drawn to the dismantling grid in this manner, also enhancing the supply of raw material from which the dismantling agents are created. The dismantling grid is self-cleaning and maintenance free, and is designed to use UV energy in a bandwidth that can physically inactivate pathogen replication defenses until photocatalytic destruction. Depending on the UV energy used, none of the powerful dismantling agents escape the apparatus because of their short half-lives. Once their job is done all return to the natural elements from which they were made, creating no environmental harm.",MICROSWEEP CORP,EDWARDS JOHN L,,https://lens.org/159-923-371-173-982,Patent Application,yes,4,8,1,2,0,A61L9/015;;A61L9/015;;A61L9/20;;A61L9/20;;A61L9/22;;A61L9/22;;B01D53/8668;;B01D53/8668;;B01D2255/802;;B01D2255/802;;B01D2259/804;;B01D2259/804;;F24F8/192;;F24F8/192;;F24F8/22;;F24F8/22;;Y02A50/20,B01J19/12,422/186.3,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   A method of processing abalone is disclosed. The first step involves placing live abalone in a tank of water where they are given an opportunity to de-stress. Thereafter the salinity of the water is decreased to about 2.5%. This has the effect of additional weight being taken up on the musculature of the abalone. Thereafter the abalone are anaesthetised in the tank to minimise any muscular activity during subsequent processing. The abalone are then taken out of the tank and shucked to detach the meat or musculature from the shell and gut exposing the three main blood vessels of the abalone. These blood vessels are then blocked by inserting a blocking material into the open end of the vessel where it forms a plug. This resists the flow of body fluid including blood out of the abalone and assists in retaining the weight of the meat. After the meat has been cleaned a liquid is injected into the meat typically by a multipoint injector. This inserts a hygroscopic or humectant material deep into the meat that resists the loss of fluid out of the meat during the cooking process. These three steps both individually cumulatively cause an increase in yield of abalone meat from a unit mass of abalone when compared with convention processing techniques. In view of the high price of abalone this has a high economic worth.

Edwards, J. C. Dec. 31. Loom shuttlechanging mechanism; stop-motions; shuttles, changing bobbins and the like in automatically.- An electromagnetic apparatus for controlling the means for replenishing the supply of weft in automatic looms is arranged so as to be suitable for use with shuttles or weftcarriers of well-known form. The ordinary weftfork slide 16 is formed with an aperture 15, which receives an extension 14 of the knock-off lever 12, pivoted to the breast beam 1 ; the shipper 10 is held in the notched plate 11 by the lever 12. A second slide 21 is mounted upon the breast beam, and carries a pivoted armature 25, which is held in its raised position, while the loom is running, by an electromagnet 26, supported by the breast beam. A branch 28 of the weft-fork hammer 19 travels in the bifurcated inner end of the slide 21, beneath the armature 25. The extension 14 passes through a slot 29 in the outer end of the slide 21, and in front of the slide is an arm 30, secured to an oscillatory shaft 31, which actuates the weft-replenishing mechanism 4. A handoperated T-shaped block 33 is pivoted to the slide, and this can be turned into the two positions shown in Figs. 2 and 5 respectively ; when the block occupies the position shown in Fig. 2, outward motion of the slide causes the arm 30 to be actuated, and, when the block occupies the position shown in Fig. 5, a similar motion effects the stoppage of the loom. A feeler or detector 42, having an expanded head 44, which bears against the weft during the beat-up, is adjustably attached to a rod 38, which passes through a hollow stand 36 and is fitted with a collar 39 and spring 40. The terminals 50, 48 of the electromagnetic circuit employed are respectively connected to contactpieces 51 and 46 ; the piece 46 bears against the rod 38, and the piece 51 has a bent end which normally rests against a spring-pressed collar 54. A carrier 57, adapted to strike the side of the shuttle 5, when the weft is insufficient for pressing back the feeler, is mounted to slide upon the rod 38, and carries the contact-piece 51. When the carrier is pushed back in this way, the contact between the collar 54 and contact-piece 51 is broken, and the armature 25 falls, and is pulled forwards, together with the slide 21, by the branch 28 of the weft-fork hammer. In a modification, the electromagnetic circuit is normally open, contact-pieces corresponding to the piece 51 and collar 54 being held apart by moans of a spring.",EDWARDS JOHN COUPER,EDWARDS JOHN COUPER,,https://lens.org/113-278-076-623-305,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

    A method for determining a desirable depth for drilling a horizontal well within an oil reservoir includes the steps of deploying a plurality of data sensors at discrete depths in a subsurface formation penetrated by a wellbore, gathering formation pressure data for the discrete depths using the data sensors, and determining the depth of a reservoir using the gathered formation pressure data. The depth within the reservoir may be determined by identifying from the gathered formation pressure data at least one depth whose corresponding formation pressure is suggestive of a reservoir. Once such a depth is identified, the wellbore itself or a lateral drainhole depending from the wellbore may be steered into the reservoir by maintaining the trajectory of the wellbore or drainhole at a substantially constant distance from a fluid contact within the reservoir.

A plurality of crop severing devices are mounted on rotatable drive shafts. The crop severing devices can take any of several forms. In one illustrative form of the present invention, the crop severing devices can be arcuate members mounted on a drive shaft by two or more support members such as support discs, with each arcuate member including a crop engaging portion and a crop passage portion terminating in a crop severing edge. Alternatively, the crop severing devices can be one or more crop severing rods mounted onto a drive shaft by support members, with the crop severing rods straight, slightly spiralled or wavy in configuration. As another alternative, the crop severing devices can include a first set of foliage-lifting rods mounted for rotation at a first speed and a second set of crop-severing rods mounted for rotation at a second speed, for example faster than the first speed, with the foliage-lifting rods spaced outwardly of the crop severing rods so that the slower rotating foliage-lifting rods lift branches, immature crops, and other foliage while the mature crops hang down to be severed by the crop severing rods. The crop severing rods and the foliage-lifting rods can be mounted on coaxial drive shafts or on drive shafts that are not coaxial. The crop severing rods can be mounted to their drive shaft by support discs, rods, cylinders or endless belts. Thus, as a crop severing device of the present invention is rotated in a crop-bearing plant, mature crops are engaged and severed from the plants, while, because of their relatively light weight, immature, green crops and foliage are not engaged sufficiently to be severed.",GINNY BEE HARVESTER CORP,EDWARDS JOHN W,,https://lens.org/061-501-123-186-49X,Granted Patent,yes,15,12,1,1,0,A01D46/24;;A01D46/24,A01D46/24,56328R,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The apparatus including a dolly (71) positionable by drive means along an extensible track arrangement (72), having a camera (73) mounted thereto and provided with motors to orientate the camera (73) by varying its pan (76), tilt (75), and roll (74). An operator interface device (15) is used to define position and velocity characteristics of the desired motion of each of the camera's axes of motion and a motor driver module (69) calculates a parametric cubic polynomial represesntation of the desired motion curve. The calculated coefficients of the motion curve parametric cubic polynomial representation are easily stored and used to regenerate the values of the curve for the purposes of display and providing motion curve values for each axis of motion of the camera. These calculations can be performed upon command and in real-time. Motion curve characteristics may be modified by way of redefining the position and velocity parameters and the values generated by a curve generator (50) may be digitally processed by a signal processing module (57). A variety of signal processing functions may be performed upon the motion curve values generated, including summation, filtering and multiplication. Digital values representative of random, periodic and aperiodic signals may be combined with each of the motion curves generated. Additionally, values of camera characteristics such as focus, film pull-down rates, shutter speed, etc. are recorded for reproduction in synchronism with the replay of the camera motion.

In a brushless synchronous machine arrangement comprising a synchronous machine, e.g. a motor, capable of being started as an induction motor and having a rotor field winding FM connected for energization from a co-rotating armature of an A.C. exciter over a rotating rectifier RB, the connections from the rectifier RB to the field winding FM are shunted by a first pair of series connected thyristors T1, T2 and associated resistors R1, R2 and by at least one other such pair T1<SP>1</SP>, T2<SP>1</SP>, as shown and the gate electrodes of the first pair of thyristors T1, T2 are connected such that they are turned on in response to a starting voltage across the rectifier network RB, induced in the rotor field winding during starting of the machine, of the same polarity but greater than the D.C. exciting voltage across the network RB during synchronous running, and the thyristors T1<SP>1</SP>, T2<SP>1</SP> of each other pair have their gate electrodes connected and controlled by the first pair of thyristors. As shown, when the machine is started as an induction motor the voltage induced in field FM is applied via Zener diodes Z1, Z2 to the gates of thyristors T1, T2 which conduct and cause the other pairs T1<SP>1</SP>, T2<SP>1</SP> to conduct. The output of the field winding FM is then limited by resistor R. For synchronous running the exciter field FE (Fig. 1, not shown), is energized so as to give a D.C. output at points A, B less than that required to turn on thyristors T1, T2, T1<SP>1</SP>, T2<SP>1</SP> but sufficient to turn on thyristors T3, T3<SP>1</SP> which short circuit resistor R.",ASS ELECT IND,EDWARDS JOHN DENIS,,https://lens.org/169-931-631-205-542,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,H02P25/03,H02P25/02,H2A AMB           MB;;H2A A1C10B        -;;H2A A24           A1C1;;H2H HAMB          AMB;;H2J JD            JD(AC);;H2J JSYN          JSYN;;H2J J1P           -;;H2J J1U           -;;H2J J1X           -;;H2J J12D          -;;H2J J12H2         -;;H2J J12NX         J1Z;;H2J J12N2         J1Z;;H2J J12N3A        J1Z;;H2J J12N3Y        J1Z,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A digital representation of a dual tone signal is generated from a multi-bit command character by determining the phase angle of two frequencies specified by the command character relative to an independent time reference signal, converting paired phase angles to amplitude signals representative of the amplitude of a sine wave having each calculated phase angle, and summing the amplitude representations to generate a value corresponding to the digital representation of the frequency pair at that particular instant. Individual phase angles are calculated by generating a multi-bit digital character corresponding to the phase angle of a sinusoidal reference signal of the particular frequency. This character is preferably generated by multiplying a multi-bit digital character having n-bits representing the fractional part of the number of seconds elapsed from some reference time by a multi-bit digital character having m bits representing the frequency of the sinusoidal signal, m and n both integers. The resulting m + n bit product consisting of an m-bit integral part and an n-bit fractional part is examined and the p most significant bits to the right of the decimal point are selected, p being an integer. The value of n determines the accuracy of the product relative to the absolute value of the phase angle, while the value of p determines the resolution of the phase angle representation. Both n and p are preselected in accordance with the required accuracy of the frequency representation.",ROLM CORP,EDWARDS JOHN D,ROLM SYSTEMS (1992-08-26);;INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION A NY CORP (1987-12-01),https://lens.org/141-816-129-794-951,Granted Patent,yes,0,10,10,10,0,H04M1/505;;H04M1/505;;H04Q1/4575;;H04Q1/4575,H04Q1/45;;G06F1/02;;H03B28/00;;H04M1/50;;H04Q1/457,179 15BY,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Various buffers may be included between the feedback line (51) and the feedback terminal (56) to reduce the capacitive load on the line (51).",PHILIPS ELECTRONICS UK LTD;;PHILIPS ELECTRONICS NV,EDWARDS MARTIN JOHN,"KONINKLIJKE PHILIPS N.V., NL (2014-03-31);;PHILIPS ELECTRONICS N.V.

The first step involves placing live abalone in a tank of water where they are given an opportunity to de-stress. Thereafter the salinity of the water is decreased to about 2.5%. This has the effect of additional weight being taken up on the musculature of the abalone. Thereafter the abalone are anaesthetised in the tank to minimise any muscular activity during subsequent processing. The abalone are then taken out of the tank and shucked to detach the meat or musculature from the shell and gut exposing the three main blood vessels of the abalone. These blood vessels are then blocked by inserting a blocking material into the open end of the vessel where it forms a plug. This resists the flow of body fluid including blood out of the abalone and assists in retaining the weight of the meat. After the meat has been cleaned a liquid is injected into the meat typically by a multipoint injector. This inserts a hygroscopic or humectant material deep into the meat that resists the loss of fluid out of the meat during the cooking process. These three steps both individually cumulatively cause an increase in yield of abalone meat from a unit mass of abalone when compared with convention processing techniques. In view of the high price of abalone this has a high economic worth.,WATKEN QUALITY TASMANIAN ABALO,EDWARDS STEPHEN JOHN,,https://lens.org/037-709-769-731-963,Patent Application,no,0,0,5,6,0,A22C29/04;;A22C29/04,A22C29/04,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Currently popular consumer grade electrostatic air filters accumulate suspended contaminants onto accumulation plates which require subsequent disposal or cleaning of the highly concentrated contaminates, a maintenance requirement that creates new jeopardy to consumer health. Disclosed are a method and apparatus with several embodiments that structurally eradicate suspended particulates after they have been electrostatically migrated to a hollow, activated dismantling rod. The dismantling rod is typically composed of a durable, UV transmitting material, such as tetrafluoroethylene, or a current carrying metal mesh coated with tetrafluoroethylene, and further over-coated with active photocatalytic material that is energized to create on its surface powerful dismantling agents, including hydroxyl radicals, from natural ambient air elements. Microorganisms, smoke particles, industrial pollutants, odor molecules, and allergens are structurally dissociated into harmless protein fragments and natural molecules when they encounter the dismantling grid purifying agents. The decontamination phenomenon is amplified by imparting, or enhancing, either a negative or positive electrostatic charge to the suspended particles, as they enter the device, and using that to migrate the particles to the activated dismantling rod containing an internal, oppositely charged attraction screen. The method can be used to eradicate particles, including lethal pathogens, that may have a naturally occurring negative, positive, or electroneutral charge. Both contaminants and suspended water molecules are drawn to the dismantling rod in this manner, providing an enhanced supply of raw material from which the decontaminating agents are created. Any trace amounts of ozone molecules produced during the process are also attracted and dissociated back to oxygen within the device. The permanent photocatalytic coating does not require renewal or cleaning, and is designed to use UV energy in a bandwidth that also physically inactivates the replication defenses of passing microorganisms until they can be dismantled, whether in the first pass on during a subsequent air exchange pass. None of the powerful dismantling agents escape the device because of their short half lives; once their job is done all return to the natural elements from which they were made, creating no environmental harm. The method and apparatus are self cleaning and maintenance free.",EDWARDS JOHN L,EDWARDS JOHN L,,https://lens.org/182-851-724-424-139,Patent Application,yes,4,29,1,2,0,A61L2/10;;A61L2/14;;B01D53/007;;B01D53/32;;B01D53/323;;B01D2255/802;;B01D2259/804;;B01D53/32;;A61L2/10;;A61L2/14;;B01D2255/802;;B01D2259/804;;B01D53/323;;B01D53/007,B01D53/00,204/157.3;;422/186.3,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

A first edge surface (e.g., an upper edge surface) of one modular unit is positioned adjacent to a second edge surface (e.g., a lower edge surface) of another modular unit. A compression system (e.g., a threaded rod under tension) and coupled to elongated beams) provides a force to compress the first edge surface of the one modular unit toward the second edge surface of the other modular unit, and a hardened backing (e.g., concrete) is positioned on the back surface of the at least two modular units. Preferably, the first and second edge surfaces are ground in order to improve the surface contact between those two edge surfaces. When producing the cast wall, the hardened backing is preferably poured onto the back of the modular units. Prior to and during the pouring, it is preferred to support a first end of the one modular unit and a second end of the other modular unit on a common rail. In one embodiment, the common rail includes a base portion and an upright portion (e.g., a T-rail), and the step of supporting includes positioning the base portion on a support surface, and setting the first end of the one modular unit and the second end of the other modular unit on the upright portion.

The apparatus including a dolly (71) positionable by drive means along an extensible track arrangement (72), having a camera (73) mounted thereto and provided with motors to orientate the camera (73) by varying its pan (76), tilt (75), and roll (74). An operator interface device (15) is used to define position and velocity characteristics of the desired motion of each of the camera's axes of motion and a motor driver module (69) calculates a parametric cubic polynomial represesntation of the desired motion curve. The calculated coefficients of the motion curve parametric cubic polynomial representation are easily stored and used to regenerate the values of the curve for the purposes of display and providing motion curve values for each axis of motion of the camera. These calculations can be performed upon command and in real-time. Motion curve characteristics may be modified by way of redefining the position and velocity parameters and the values generated by a curve generator (50) may be digitally processed by a signal processing module (57). A variety of signal processing functions may be performed upon the motion curve values generated, including summation, filtering and multiplication. Digital values representative of random, periodic and aperiodic signals may be combined with each of the motion curves generated. Additionally, values of camera characteristics such as focus, film pull-down rates, shutter speed, etc. are recorded for reproduction in synchronism with the replay of the camera motion. The provision of a camera motion control apparatus having the described facilities, enables accurate repeatability of camera motion and scene recording for digital image integration to real-life recordings, multiple time scale motion and film recording techniques for special effects.",DIGITAL ARTS FILM & TELEVISION,EDWARDS JOHN R,,https://lens.org/136-108-356-162-729,Patent Application,no,0,0,7,7,0,F16M11/18;;G05B19/4093;;G05B19/416;;G05B19/42;;G05B2219/34047;;G05B2219/36171;;G05B2219/36495;;G05B2219/45176;;H04N5/222;;F16M11/10;;F16M11/105;;F16M11/2014;;F16M11/2021;;F16M11/2085;;F16M11/28;;F16M11/425;;F16M13/027;;F16M2200/044;;H04N23/62;;H04N23/695;;G05B19/4093;;G05B19/416;;G05B2219/36171;;H04N5/222;;G05B19/42;;G05B2219/36495;;G05B2219/45176;;F16M11/18;;G05B2219/34047;;F16M11/2085;;F16M11/2021;;F16M2200/044;;F16M11/425;;F16M11/105;;F16M11/2014;;F16M11/28;;F16M13/027;;F16M11/10;;H04N23/62;;H04N23/695,G03B15/00;;B25J9/18;;F16M11/18;;F16M11/42;;G05B19/4093;;G05B19/41;;G05B19/416;;G05B19/42;;G05D3/00;;H04N5/222;;H04N5/232,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The system is particularly useful for garbage pickup, to record the weight of garbage picked up at any given location, but obviously may have many analogous application. An electronic transmitter-identity tag, i.e. a radio frequency tag (RF tag), is either affixed to a waste receptacle or secured in the proximity of a waste pickup point. The RF tag contains a microprocessor with a permanent memory so that identification data can be programmed into it to identify the source of the waste. The RF tag also contains a radio transmitting system and a long wave radio receiver. A radio frequency reader, which includes a microprocessor controlled radio frequency transmitter and a microprocessor controlled radio frequency receiver, is mounted on a waste collection vehicle. During pickup operations, the RF reader sends a radio signal, and the RF tag responds by sending back source identification data, such as the address. The reader sends this information to a computer, which also receives a signal from a scale. The computer processes and records the data so that the weight of the material picked up can be matched with the source information.","EDWARDS, JOHN B.",EDWARDS JOHN B,,https://lens.org/012-933-059-808-128,Patent Application,no,0,2,2,2,0,B65F1/1484;;B65F2003/022;;G07C5/008;;G07C5/085,B65F1/14;;B65F3/02;;G07C5/00;;G07C5/08,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

A digital representation of a dual tone signal is generated from a multi-bit command character by determining the phase angle of two frequencies specified by the command character relative to an independent time reference signal, converting paired phase angles to amplitude signals representative of the amplitude of a sine wave having each calculated phase angle, and summing the amplitude representations to generate a value corresponding to the digital representation of the frequency pair at that particular instant. Individual phase angles are calculated by generating a multi-bit digitial character corresponding to the phase angle of a sinusoidal reference signal of the particular frequency. This character is preferably generated by multiplying a multi-bit digital character having n-bits representing the fractional part of the number of seconds elapsed from some reference time by a multi-bit digital character having m bits representing the frequency of the sinusoidal signal, m and n both integers. The resulting m + n bit product consisting of an m-bit integral part and an n-bit fractional part is examined and the p most significant bits to the right of the decimal point are selected, p being an integer. The value of n determines the accuracy of the product relative to the absolute value of the phase angle, while the value of p determines the resolution of the phase angle representation. Both n and p are preselected in accordance with the required accuracy of the frequency representation.",ROLM CORP,EDWARDS JOHN D,,https://lens.org/091-232-132-464-08X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,10,10,0,H04M1/505;;H04M1/505;;H04Q1/4575;;H04Q1/4575,H04Q1/45;;G06F1/02;;H03B28/00;;H04M1/50;;H04Q1/457,354-93,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Dec. 18, 1951 [Jan. 5, 1951], No. 407/51. Class 39(1) [Also in Group XL(b)] The energization of the focus coil 4 of the imageconverter section of a television pick-up tube 1 is interrupted or considerably reduced except during the frame-blanking period when the image is required to be projected on to the storage target. This is effected by supplying the focus current from a pulse generator 6. Simultaneously the photocathode 2 is biased by voltage pulses from generator 5 so as to emit electrons only during the time of energization of the focusing coil. In order that the tube will be at full operating condition during the frame blanking period, the voltage and current pulses slightly exceed the duration of the frame blanking period.

SOLUTION: The video image is divided into the plural geometrical blocks and the weighting map, for which quality measuring threshold values are specified values for each block, is generated. Next, the video image is compared with a correspondent test video image, and a quality error value for each block is generated. For example, these blocks forms plural matrixes to be arbitrary horizontal and vertical dimensions. Since the evaluation of image quality is calculated for each block and the quality measured value is allocated for each block, for example, a central part receives a low error threshold value and a peripheral part receives a high threshold value. Then, the quality error value in the block, where the quality error value is equal with or higher than the specified quality measuring threshold value from the block weighting map, is displayed.",TEKTRONIX INC,EDWARDS JOHN W,,https://lens.org/194-228-800-882-838,Patent Application,no,0,0,7,7,0,H04N17/004,H04N17/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Electric selective signalling; decade ring counters. ELECTRIC & MUSICAL INDUSTRIES Ltd. Aug. 6, 1964 [Aug. 9, 1963]. No. 31480/63. Headings G4A and G4H. In an analogue-to-digital converter of the balancing type, the comparator controls the size of the steps in which a bidirectional multiorder digital counter is incremented/decremented. The A.C. or D.C. input analogue voltage is compared at 1 with a reference analogue voltage from digital-to-analogue converter 2 the input of which is the reading of a counter 3. Means 4 determines which comparator input is the greater, and means 6 (utilizing a Schmitt circuit) determines whether the error exceeds a predetermined threshold. The outputs from means 4, 6 control diode gates in means 5 to route clock pulses to the count up or count down input of either the hundreds or the units decade of counter 3 until balance is obtained at comparator 1 or the counter 3 reaches one of its limits (see below). Digitalto-analogue converter 2 may be a tapped transformer in the A.C. case. As a modification counting pulses may alternatively be fed directly to any decade. Counter (Fig. 4, not shown). The counter has four decades with inter-decade carry, each decade being of conventional ring type utilizing silicon-controlled-rectifiers. As stated above, pulses to be counted may be routed to the count up or count down line of either the units or hundreds decade (or others possibly). Diode AND-gates controlled from the counter stages prevent the counter overrunning 9999 (counting up) or 0000 (counting down) by cutting off the counting pulses at 5, Fig. 1.",EMI LTD,EDWARDS JOHN RONALD,,https://lens.org/050-411-296-873-628,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H03M1/00;;H03M1/50,H03M1/00,G4A A1C1A         J;;G4A A1C2          J;;G4A A1C4A         J;;G4A A1C5Y         J;;G4A A1C7          J;;G4A A10EX         J;;G4A A2C           J;;G4A A3W10W1       J;;G4A A3W10Y        J;;G4D DCC           CC;;H3H HAF           -;;H3H HAV           AV;;H3H H14A          AV;;H3H H14B          AV;;H3H H2A           AV;;H3H H23F          AV;;H3H H3A           AV;;H3H H3B           AV;;H3H H3C           AV;;H3H H3F           AV;;H3H H6A           AV;;H3H H6B           AV;;H3H H6D           AV;;H3H H6E           AV;;H3H H7A2          AV;;H3H H7B           AV;;H3H H7C           AV;;H3H H7F           AV;;H3H H8D           AV;;H3H H8E           AV,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

An apparatus for analysing the performance of an A.C. machine 1 incorporates two positional resolvers 6, 12 having three phase stators and two phase rotors the rotors being mechanically coupled to that of the test machine through gearing such that they are driven at relative speeds in the ratio of the relative numbers of poles on the respective machines. By means of tranformers 18, 19 connected across the windings of the test machine, voltages are developed across resistors 21, 22, which are fed to amplifiers 23, 24 whose gains may be adjusted so that currents proportional to the phase voltages of the test machine may be fed to the stator winding of the first resolver 6. Further, using current transformers 31, 32 and adjustable amplifiers 35, 36, currents proportional to the phase currents of the test machine are fed to the stator windings of the resolver 12. The voltages induced on the rotors of the resolvers which are driven in unison with the rotor of the test machine, represent the two axis component voltages and currents of the test machine respectively, and signals proportional to these are derived at 29, 30 and 41, 42 respectively. The desired voltages are compared with calculated valves to analyse the performance of the machine.

In one embodiment an apparatus converts “packets” of methane gas to liquid methanol. Methane gas and aqueous hydrogen peroxide are injected into the packet apparatus through valved ports and mixed in a structurally robust, rotating reaction chamber coated with metal cation catalyst. Although operating at low temperature and pressure, the rotating chamber is sufficiently strong enough to contain spontaneous ignition of the mixture should that occur. The reactive oxygen species, primarily hydroxyl radicals, released in the chamber of mildly elevated temperature, oxidize the methane molecule, replacing one hydrogen atom on its molecule with one stable hydroxyl OH molecule, converting vapor methane CH 4 to vapor methanol CH 3 OH. Vapor exiting the exhaust port condenses on ambient temperature drip screens to stable liquid methanol. An alternate continuous process embodiment uses flow-through conversion screens coated with immobilized dry chemicals. Water vapor entering the apparatus releases molecular oxygen from screens coated with dry urea hydrogen peroxide. A circulating endless belt screen is used to continual recoat the dry urea hydrogen peroxide. Reactive oxygen species are generated on successive conversion screens through which the molecular oxygen, and methane gas entering the apparatus, must pass. Metal cation catalyst molecules physically entrapped within interstitial cavities of a three dimensional, fixed porous colloidal matrix coating on the screens create powerful hydroxyl radicals from the molecular oxygen. These reactive species in turn convert methane molecules impacting the conversion screens to methanol molecules. The method and apparata operate at modest temperature, pressure, and energy requirement levels, and are scalable from portable units to industrial scale methanol refineries.",EDWARDS JOHN LEE,EDWARDS JOHN LEE,,https://lens.org/059-142-646-285-864,Patent Application,yes,0,5,1,1,0,B01J7/02;;B01J12/007;;B01J19/0053;;B01J19/0066;;B01J19/1875;;C01B3/34;;C01B15/022;;C07C29/48;;B01F25/621;;B01F25/60;;C07C29/48;;B01J7/02;;B01J12/007;;C01B3/34;;B01J19/0053;;B01J19/1875;;C01B15/022;;B01J19/0066;;B01F25/60;;B01F25/621,C07C27/06,518/702,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The output of an inductive loop vehicle detector (13), Fig. 1 (not shown), passes in parallel to an integrating circuit (resistance 31 and capacitor 32) and to a pulse-shaping circuit which produces a standard output pulse for each rise in detector output. The pulseshaping circuit may comprise a capacitor (33) feeding a relay (34) in parallel with a rectifier (35) arranged so that only increases in detector output operate the relay. The relay contacts (36) control a normalizing circuit (37) producing a standard output pulse for each vehicle detected, and these pulses feed an indicator (38) which may be a counter or leaky integrator giving a measure of traffic flow. The output of the first integrating circuit (31, 32) is indicative of the number of vehicles within the detector loop (10) and will rise if the vehicles are stationary; this output may be used to operate an alarm (40) or a warning light on a display map when it exceeds a predetermined level, e.g. indicating three stationary vehicles in a loop adapted to accommodate four vehicles. Provision may be made for re-setting the alarm as soon as a flow pulse is produced by the normalizing circuit (37), or after two or more flow pulses are produced. The computer unit (30) may be located at a central control point remote from the detector (13).",DECCA LTD,PARKER ERIC;;EDWARDS JOHN,,https://lens.org/012-818-158-452-901,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G08G1/042,G08G1/042,G4Q Q12AY         -;;G4Q Q12A1         -;;G4Q Q12X          -;;G4Q Q13D          -;;G4Q Q13E4         -;;G4Q Q13G4         -;;G4Q Q13G5         -;;G4Q Q13G9         -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
