Gamble, J. A. Oct. 18. Printing on mercantile forms, letter-sheets, etc.; rotary machines.-Relates to apparatus for printing headings on paper used for noting messages and orders at the telephone or counter or for invoices or receipt forms, of the type in which the paper from a roller after passing over the desk or writing-sur. face is wound on a receiving-drum. Near the paper roll A is a type wheel or cylinder B mounted on an axis C so as to rotate in contact with the paper on the roll A or with the paper that has been drawn off, in which case a wood roller is provided to receive the pressure of the type in printing. A spring may be provided to keep the type-wheel in contact with the paper. The type-wheel B is mounted on arms D pivoted at E, and a spring F forces the arm D upwards, so that the type-wheel B is in contact with the roll A. By turning the receiving-roll or pulling the free end of the paper G, the paper is wound off the roll A and the type-wheel is rotated.

The paper A, Fig. 2, in its passage between the two drums B, C passes over rollers c and a plain surface D in front of the opening in the casing E. The drums B, C are normally prevented from being turned backwards by the ratchet-wheels M and pawls L, which latter can be put out of action when desired. In order that the drums may be removable, the shank G, Fig. 5, of the milled heads F has a clutch H for engaging with the flanged stud 0 at the end of the drum. Longitudinal movement of the heads F is prevented by the grooves g in the shanks G engaging in slots in a sliding plate I, Fig. 3, which can be moved so that the heads F may be disengaged from the drums. The studs O and pins P are mounted in springy plates J to facilitate removal of the drums.

These drums are now provided with ratchet-wheels and pawls and are normally prevented from moving longitudinally by a laterally-moving plate provided with slots engaging with grooves on the axles. On sliding this plate to one side, the drums can be drawn out and refilled. The drum C is locked in one direction by its ratchet-wheel M and pawl L, while on the other end of the drum B a similar ratchet-wheel and pawl locks the drum in the other direction, preventing any movement of the paper. By means of the lever 3 and the cam 4, either pawl may be disengaged and the drums rotated in either direction. For duplicating purposes, an additional ""window"" e<2> through which the paper is exposed is provided, and beneath the paper A passes the carbon paper X from the roll Y and the ""copy"" paper A<1> from the roll W.

   This invention relates to a practical superconducting conductor based upon biaxially textured high temperature superconducting coatings. In particular, methods for producing flexible and bend strain-resistant articles and articles produced in accordance therewith are described which provide improved current sharing, lower hysteretic losses under alternating current conditions, enhanced electrical and thermal stability and improved mechanical properties between otherwise isolated films in a coated high temperature superconducting (HTS) wire. Multilayered materials including operational material which is sensitive to bend strain can be constructed, in which the bend strain in the region in which such operational material is located is minimized. The invention also provides a means for splicing coated tape segments and for termination of coated tape stack ups or conductor elements. 

   In one embodiment, a multi-layer high temperature superconductor is provided and includes first and second high temperature superconductor coated elements. Each element includes a substrate, at least one buffer deposited on the substrate, a high temperature superconductor layer, and a cap layer. The first and second high temperature superconductor coated elements are joined at the first and second cap layers.

In particular, methods for producing flexible and bend strain-resistant articles and articles produced in accordance therewith are described which provide improved current sharing, lower hysteretic losses under alternating current conditions, enhanced electrical and thermal stability and improved mechanical properties between otherwise isolated films in a coated high temperature superconducting (HTS) wire. Multilayered materials including operational material which is sensitive to bend strain can be constructed, in which the bend strain in the region in which such operational material is located is minimized. The invention also provides a means for splicing coated tape segments and for termination of coated tape stack ups or conductor elements. In one embodiment, a multi-layer high temperature superconductor is provided and includes first and second high temperature superconductor coated tape elements (11a, 11b). Each element includes s substrate (12a, 12b), at least one buffer (14a, 14b) deposited on the substrate, a high temperature superconductor layer (16a, 16b) and a metallic cap layer (18a, 18b). The first and second high temperature superconductor coated elements are joined at the first and second cap layers using soldering, diffusion bounding or the like.",AMERICAN SUPERCONDUCTOR CORP,FRITZEMEIER LESLIE G;;THIEME CORNELIS LEO HANS;;FLESHLER STEVEN;;SCUDIERE JOHN D;;SNITCHLER GREGORY L;;GAMBLE BRUCE B;;SCHWALL ROBERT E;;YU DINGAN;;RILEY GILBERT N JR;;OTTO ALEXANDER;;THOMPSON ELLIOT D,,https://lens.org/041-757-278-361-874,Patent Application,no,0,0,50,71,0,C30B23/02;;C30B23/002;;C30B29/16;;Y10T428/12028;;H10N60/203;;H10N60/0324;;H10N60/0548;;H10N60/0632;;H10N60/0801;;Y10T428/12028;;C30B29/16;;C30B23/02;;C30B23/002;;H10N60/0801;;H10N60/203;;H10N60/0324;;H10N60/0548;;H10N60/0632,B22F7/00;;B22F7/02;;B23K35/36;;C30B5/00;;C30B23/02;;H01B12/06;;H01B13/00;;H01L39/14;;H01L39/24,,0,0,,,,PATENTED
