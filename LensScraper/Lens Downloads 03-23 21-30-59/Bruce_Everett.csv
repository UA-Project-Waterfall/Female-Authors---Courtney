The converter approaches a desired charge balance by cycling between a charging and a discharging state. A clock signal provided by a stable oscillator (118) is applied to a clock input of a CMOS D-type flip-flop (116). The analog input signal (Vin) effectively is fed to a non-inverting input (103) of an integrating amplifier (104). The output (114) of the integrating amplifier (104) is fed to the D input of the flip-flop (116), which input has a threshold level. The Q output of the flip-flop (116) is connected via a voltage divider (119) to an inverting input (112) of the integrating amplifier (104). This . configuration eliminates the need for a dual polarity power r supply. When the output (114) of the integrating amplifier (104) rises above the threshold level of the D input, on the next rising edge of the clock signal, the flip-flop (116) sends feedback pulses to the inverting input (112), thus beginning the discharge state. Each feedback pulse causes the integrating amplifier (104) to discharge a predetermined amount. When the output of the integrating amplifier (104) falls below the D input threshold level, feedback pulses are inhibited, and the charging state begins again. The output pulses from the flip-flop (116) when accumulated over a period of time, represent the charge required to balance the charge provided by the input signal (Vin). The feedback pulses are summed by an accumulator (130) to provide an indication of the converter input.",SANGAMO WESTON,RANDALL BRUCE EVERETT,,https://lens.org/029-271-817-014-181,Patent Application,yes,4,2,3,4,0,H03K7/06,H03K7/06,,6,2,000-010-634-320-858;;131-213-298-868-266,10.1088/0022-3735/7/9/008;;10.1524/teme.1981.48.jg.249,"ELECTRONICS INTERNATIONAL, vol. 55, no. 11, June 1982, New York, USA; M.

   Current to a relay causes a telephone to be connected to a SLIC. Following LOOP, a sleep switch opens to interrupt current to the power supply converter after a first predetermined period expires. If the telephone is on-hook, loss of current to the relay causes disconnection from the SLIC, but causes connection to a battery. 

   Current sensed from the battery through an off-hook hook switch generates a current signal. The current signal closes a current switch, which is in parallel with the open sleep switch, thereby providing a current path to the converter. The sleep switch then makes and then the current switch breaks. 

   After awakening, a ring-back signal informs a user that telephony service has been restored and a message may indicate that telephony service is being sought. When the telephone is placed back on-hook, counting of a second predetermined period starts, after which the sleep switch opens again.

   An apparatus is provided for performing in-line extraction, activation and sealing of a lithium polymer (LiPo) battery. The apparatus includes a pair of nosepieces that are inserted into opposing, open sides of the battery. A pair of clamp and seal arrangements associated with each nosepiece are moved from an insertion position to a clamp/seal position wherein outer packaging of the battery is sealed against an outer, convex surface of the nosepieces. Thereafter, an extraction fluid, such as heated, dry air or an inert atmosphere may be drawn through the battery, the nosepieces providing access to the interior of the battery, to thereby effect extraction. Thereafter, an electrolyte may be drawn into the interior of the battery using the nosepieces. A pair of sealing bars seal the open sides of the packaging.

The system utilizes an optical energy source for generating a source beam. The source beam is divided into two beams by reflecting one portion of the beam off of a reflective surface, e.g., a front surface, of an optically transmissive test sample having the unknown thickness or refractive index. A second portion of the beam is transmitted through the sample and reflected off a refractive interface in the sample, e.g., a back surface. The two reflected beams are combined into a composite beam. The composite beam is then directed to a Mach-Zehnder type interferometer, where a portion of the combined beam traverses a fixed optical path length, and another portion traverses a variable optical path length.

   An advertisement system and method are provided for inserting into an end user communication message a background reference to an advertisement. In some embodiments, the background reference causes an advertisement image to be tiled, or watermarked, across an end user screen behind the text of an e-mail message or public posting. A message server inserts the background reference after receiving a message originally sent from an end user originator and before sending the message to be delivered to an end user recipient. When necessary, the message server will convert at least a portion of the message into a proper format, such as HTML, before inserting the background reference to an advertisement, which is preferably selected in accordance with end user recipient demographic information and/or ad exposure statistics. The advertisement itself, often a graphical file, is preferably not transmitted with the message, but is typically stored at the message server or other location remote from the end user recipient. Preferably, the message server maintains and refer to records on each end user recipient to allow for selective enablement of background reference insertion and overwriting based upon end user preferences. According to various non-web example embodiments, the message server transmits an SMTP, POP3 or NNTP message with an HTML portion for a respective HTML-compatible client. In other web-based example embodiments, the message server transmits the entire message in HTML to be used as a stand-alone web page or as a portion of a larger page employing frames or tables.

The compounds persist on the skin for much longer than conventional sunscreens because they comprise a Michael acceptor linked directly or indirectly to a chromophore. The Michael acceptor is capable of undergoing a conjugate addition reaction with thiol groups present in cysteine residues of keratin and thus the compound is chemically bound to the skin and will not be removed by immersion in water.,VANGUARD MEDICA LTD,DAVISON BRUCE EVERETT;;JONES BRYAN COLIN;;GANELLIN CHARON ROBIN;;BISHOP PAUL BEAUMONT;;JACK DAVID,,https://lens.org/117-764-212-522-090,Patent Application,no,0,0,26,26,0,A61K8/44;;A61K2800/57;;A61K2800/94;;A61Q17/04;;C07C233/20;;C07C233/33;;C07C233/55;;C07D207/452;;C07D207/452;;C07C233/20;;C07C233/55;;C07C233/33;;A61K2800/94;;A61Q17/04;;A61K8/44;;A61K2800/57,A61K8/00;;A61K8/36;;A61K8/41;;A61K8/42;;A61K8/44;;A61K8/49;;A61K31/40;;A61Q17/04;;C07C50/02;;C07C50/28;;C07C50/38;;C07C69/60;;C07C225/28;;C07C229/44;;C07C231/02;;C07C233/20;;C07C233/27;;C07C233/32;;C07C233/33;;C07C233/55;;C07D207/44;;C07D207/452;;C09K3/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Suitable queries include star/join queries with a large fact table joined with multiple subsidiary dimension tables, where indices exist over fact table join columns. The query is analyzed to prepare a query plan for the dimension table accesses. This plan is supplemented by adding nested loop join operations, where the inner table is a dimension table plan and the outer table is an index scan performed over a fact table index of the join column with the dimension table. The plan is also supplemented by filtering records resulting from the nested loop joins using a sequence of dynamic bit vectors, ultimately yielding a list of probable fact table records. The plan is further supplemented by fetching these records to construct a distilled fact which is used, instead of the large original table, to execute the query in considerably less time. If desired, the supplemented query plan and other competing approaches may studied to provide cost estimates, with the least costly approach being actually implemented.",IBM,LINDSAY BRUCE GILBERT;;LOHMAN GUY MARING;;PIRAHESH MIR HAMID;;SHEKITA EUGENE JON;;SIMMEN DAVID EVERETT;;URATA MONICA SACHIYE,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (1998-01-23),https://lens.org/052-398-640-989-54X,Granted Patent,yes,12,117,1,1,0,G06F16/24544;;G06F16/24544;;Y10S707/99932;;Y10S707/99934;;Y10S707/99933,G06F17/30,707/4;;707/2;;707/3,5,4,017-051-959-794-62X;;108-104-320-911-675;;116-317-110-770-148;;082-576-793-200-068,10.1109/69.50905;;10.1145/211990.212001;;10.1145/362686.362692;;10.1016/0022-0000(79)90044-8,"DeWitt et al, The Gamma Database Machine Project, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering. vol. 2.
