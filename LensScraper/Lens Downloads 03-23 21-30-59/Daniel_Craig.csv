    A system and process for remediating an asbestos containing material (ACM), or a regulated asbestos containing material (RACM), with a vermicultural process, or vermiprocess. Worms are employed to convert the ACM into a material with an acceptable, deminimus level of asbestos fibers, or further to a non-detectable level of asbestos. The process includes placing an asbestos containing material into a worm bin and mixing the asbestos containing material with an effective quantity of a worm adjuvant, optionally employing organic material and mixing in a homogenizer. The worm bin may be a single bin or alternatively an array of staged worm bins. The worms are introduced into the ACM to form an asbestos containing vermicompost. The preferred worm species employed the species Esenia hortensis , or hortensis , and Esenia fetida , commonly referred to as red wigglers, or red worms. The processing of the asbestos containing material with the worms includes the ingestion of the asbestos containing materials by the worms to forming a vermiprocessed product. The product may be liquified and micronized for disposal for further processing.

The stream is accelerated in a convergent venturi section upstream of the outlet to distribute and concentrate the coal particles toward a central portion of the venturi in a minimum area throat, followed by decelerating the flow downstream of the venturi throat in a convergent flow section while forming a shallow, annular, conically shaped flow pattern around a hollow spreader cone mounted in the convergent section. The annular flow is caused to swirl around the axis of the cone by vanes outwardly thereof within the convergent flow section of the venturi, thus forming a stable, annularly-shaped, swirling flow pattern for discharge into the combustion zone, wherein the coal is burned in an elongated flame pattern extending along the stabilized conical flow pattern. A zone of high temperature and reducing atmosphere is formed adjacent the hollow outer end of the cone due to recirculation of combustion products into the rich fuel/air mixture wherein the volatiles in the coal are driven off early in the combustion process and are rapidly burned in a continuing process reducing the formation of oxides of nitrogen.",RILEY STOKER CORP,ITSE DANIEL C;;PENTERSON CRAIG A,RILEY POWER INC (2003-02-04),https://lens.org/171-806-862-534-633,Granted Patent,yes,22,50,1,5,0,F23D1/02;;Y02E20/34;;F23D1/02;;Y02E20/34,F23D1/02,110/347;;431/182;;431/186;;110/261;;110/264;;110/265,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A preloaded stabilizer mechanism in a dot matrix line printer having a reciprocating carriage is provided to: (1) establish a rigid reference point that prevents the print line of the dot matrix line printer from drifting; (2) eliminate backlash; and, (3) create a carriage resonance frequency that is greater than the carriage operating frequency to enhance printer system stability and the reduction of vibration. The stabilizer mechanism is mounted on a support frame of the dot matrix line printer and includes a modified c-shaped bracket member and a spring plate. The spring plate is attached to one end of the bracket member to form a slot. The slot of the stabilizer mechanism receives an offset shaft that is coupled to a shuttle mechanism that provides the carriage with reciprocating motion. The spring plate of the stabilizer mechanism, being slightly deflected, imposes a force against the offset shaft. As the carriage is reciprocated back and forth along its line of movement, the offset shaft moves back and forth along a line that lies parallel to the carriage movement line. When the shuttle mechanism is out of balance with the carriage, the offset shaft imposes a force, corresponding to the amount of the imbalance, against the preloaded spring plate and bracket opening. In this state, the stabilizer mechanism, due to the offset shaft/slot arrangement, works in conjunction with the shuttle mechanism to translate the shuttle. The stabilizer mechanism inhibits the movement of the offset shaft with respect to the printer support frame when the force created by the imbalance is equal to or less than the force of the preload generated by the spring plate.

A venturi-like, flow constrictor is coaxially disposed in the nozzle adjacent the outlet end with a divergent flow section terminating at a maximum diameter adjacent the outlet end of the nozzle in the furnace. A convergent venturi section is mounted upstream for concentrating the pulverized coal toward the central portion of the flowing stream and a flow spreader is mounted in coaxial alignment in the divergent flow section of the venturi and includes a maximum diameter, open end adjacent the outlet end of the nozzle . Wall surf aces of the spreader cooperate with those of the divergent flow section to form an annular pattern of discharge from the outlet end of the nozzle. A stream of secondary air is introduced to flow in a rapidly swirling annular pattern around the discharge from the nozzle, and by properly matching the secondary air velocity to that of the primary air/coal discharge velocity, the flame is increased in length and an outer, torroidal recirculation zone is formed around the outside of the coal/air discharge pattern. An inner, recirculation zone is created adjacent the large open end of the flow spreader inside the primary air/coal discharge pattern. A plurality of swirl vanes are provided between the outer surface of the spreader and the adjacent facing surface of the divergent flow section for imparting a swirling action for stabilizing the annular discharge pattern of the primary coal/air stream from the conduit into the furnace.

    This disclosure provides a system for classifying images, used in image detection, image recognition, or other computer vision. The system processes directory images to obtain eigenvectors and eigenvalues, and selects a set of smooth basis vectors formed by linear combinations of these eigenvectors to be applied against a target image. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, a group of the eigenvectors having the weakest eigenvalues are used to select the basis vectors. A second process is then performed on this group of weakest eigenvectors to identify a set of candidate vectors, ordered in terms of smoothness. The set of basis vectors (preferably 3-9) is then chosen from the candidate vectors in order of smoothness, which are then applied in an image detection or image recognition process. Unlike some conventional systems where strong directory presence and thresholds are used to detect possible matches, the present system uses smooth, weak vectors to ideally produce zero or near zero results for matches.

   A tool guide for guiding an end effector of a robotically controlled surgical instrument from a position outside a patient body to a position in close proximity to an internal surgical site within the patient body is provided. The tool guide typically comprises a body, a seat formation on the body, the seat formation being arranged to seat in an aperture leading into the patient body so as to mount the tool guide on the patient body, and a sheath formation on the body. The sheath formation typically defines a longitudinally extending internal passage, an inlet leading into the passage and an outlet leading from the passage. The sheath formation is arranged to cooperate with the seat formation such that when the seat formation is seated in the aperture, the outlet of the sheath formation can be positioned in close proximity to the internal surgical site thereby to enable the end effector to be guided to a position in close proximity to the surgical site by passing it through the inlet, along the passage and out from the outlet, so as to emerge from the outlet at the position in close proximity to the internal surgical site.

    This disclosure provides a system for classifying images, used in image detection, image recognition, or other computer vision. The system processes directory images to obtain eigenvectors and eigenvalues, and selects a set of smooth basis vectors formed by linear combinations of these eigenvectors to be applied against a target image. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, a group of the eigenvectors having the weakest eigenvalues are used to select the basis vectors. A second process is then performed on this group of weakest eigenvectors to identify a set of candidate vectors, ordered in terms of smoothness. The set of basis vectors (preferably 3-9) is then chosen from the candidate vectors in order of smoothness, which are then applied in an image detection or image recognition process. Unlike some conventional systems where strong directory presence and thresholds are used to detect possible matches, the present system uses smooth, weak vectors to ideally produce zero or near zero results for matches.

   This disclosure provides a system for classifying images, used in image detection, image recognition, or other computer vision. The system processes directory images to obtain eigenvectors and eigenvalues, and selects a set of smooth basis vectors formed by linear combinations of these eigenvectors to be applied against a target image. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, a group of the eigenvectors having the weakest eigenvalues are used to select the basis vectors. A second process is then performed on this group of weakest eigenvectors to identify a set of candidate vectors, ordered in terms of smoothness. The set of basis vectors (preferably 3-9) is then chosen from the candidate vectors in order of smoothness, which are then applied in an image detection or image recognition process. Unlike some conventional systems where strong directory presence and thresholds are used to detect possible matches, the present system uses smooth, weak vectors to ideally produce zero or near zero results for matches.

   A tool guide for guiding an end effector of a robotically controlled surgical instrument from a position outside a patient body to a position in close proximity to an internal surgical site within the patient body is provided. The tool guide typically comprises a body, a seat formation on the body, the seat formation being arranged to seat in an aperture leading into the patient body so as to mount the tool guide on the patient body, and a sheath formation on the body. The sheath formation typically defines a longitudinally extending internal passage, an inlet leading into the passage and an outlet leading from the passage. The sheath formation is arranged to cooperate with the seat formation such that when the seat formation is seated in the aperture, the outlet of the sheath formation can be positioned in close proximity to the internal surgical site thereby to enable the end effector to be guided to a position in close proximity to the surgical site by passing it through the inlet, along the passage and out from the outlet, so as to emerge from the outlet at the position in close proximity to the internal surgical site.
