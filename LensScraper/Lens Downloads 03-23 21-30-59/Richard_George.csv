This disclosure adds further novel and inventive developments to the cyclonic device which enable it to be used as a separating device for systems involving all three phases (gas, liquid and solid) and where two, three or more different product streams may be separated, all within the same cylindrical profile. These further inventive developments also relate to the use of externally supplied gas and / or additional liquid phases which are injected through the walls of the cyclonic body using specifically located slots and / or holes in combination with specifically located stepped edges. These further novel and inventive developments enable the concepts of froth floatation (FF) and Dispersed Air Floatation (DAF) to be exploited within an enhanced gravitational field together with the options for washing the separated froth and / or the separated heavier fractions, all within the same cyclonic unit. As part of the novel and inventive introduction of the stepped edges, means are provided whereby gas bubbles smaller than 30 microns can be created on a large scale and with a reduced energy input relative to typical conventional equipment. Also, the size of the gas bubbles may be controlled together with the intensity of any particle on particle interactions that may be created. This latter has many potential applications within FF and / or DAF processes, including applications within oil and tar separation from solid surfaces and within many ore preparation and ore leaching processes. The tubular profile enables processing and separation to be achieved ""within the pipe line"" or for very closely packed arrangements to be assembled within carrier vessels.",CYDAF TECH LIMITED,PAXTON RICHARD GEORGE,,https://lens.org/003-057-511-047-916,Granted Patent,no,1,0,14,14,0,B01D45/16;;B04C5/10;;B04C5/06;;B04C5/103;;B04C5/13;;B04C5/14;;B04C5/28;;B01D21/2411;;B01D21/267;;B03D1/1418;;B01D17/0217;;B01D19/0057;;B01D47/00;;B01D45/16;;B04C5/10;;B04C5/06;;B04C5/103;;B04C5/13;;B04C5/14;;B04C5/28;;B01D21/2411;;B01D21/267;;B03D1/1418;;B01D17/0217;;B01D19/0057;;B01F23/232,B01D45/16;;B03D1/14;;B04C5/10;;B04C7/00,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

Tills; coins, testing.-The cash till described in Specification 863/08 is provided with modified means for operating and controlling the sprocket - wheels, and with a mechanism for feeding coins to the shelves and ejecting bent or thick coins. Above the sprocket-wheels 2 of the shelf-carrying chains is a hopper formed of an inclined plate 5 and a hinged vertical glass plate 6, the hopper being divided to take different classes of coins by partitions 58. Across the top is a plate 7 having coin slots 8, which may be provided with flared mouths 8<a>. A ribbed rubber covered roller 9 extends into the throat of the hopper and is rotated to separate coins in face-contact as they pass to the throat, the side members 6, 16 of which are spaced by pieces 58. A stepped inclined plate 59 leads coins to the throat and helps to separate those in face-contact, a plate 60 preventing the coins falling direct and a curved baffle directing them horizontally to the throat. The shaft of the roller 9 carries a pinion 11 gearing with a pinion 12 loose on a shaft 13 which carries an operating ratchet 14 and a pin 26 working in a helical slot 27 in a sleeve 28 on the shaft 13. The sleeve carries arms 29, 30, the former carrying a slotted spring-held piece 31, in which works a pin 64 attached to a slide 62 having apertures normally registering with those in the plate 7, but closing those apertures when the sleeve is moved. To the slide 62 is pivoted a curved coin directing and scraping piece 67. A pivoted yoke 22 carries a sleeve 34 with a handle 36 normally resting on a plate 38, the sleeve, when moved to the left, being arrested by a hook 39. The handle may then be depressed to depress a weighted pawl 43 causing it to leave one of four studs 21 on a sprocket 2 and then contact with the next. On allowing the spring 24 to return the yoke, the sprockets are advanced and the shelves moved. Simultaneously, a lever 20 is moved by a stud 21 to turn a plate 18 on its pivot. At the other end an arm 47 actuates two sliding stops 45, which alternately act to contact with studs 21 to prevent overrunning. A projection 37 on the sleeve 34 actuates the arm 30 to turn the pin 26 in the slot 27 to actuate the roller 9. Further, as the studs 21 turn, one of them raises a lever 51 pivoted on an arm 49 attached to the plate 6. This plate is thereby moved out to widen the throat, the thick or bent coins then dropping and being deflected by the plate 18, which is held in its inclined position by an angle-piece 57, and thrown out of the machine. On return of the handle, a pawl 54 is raised to reset the arm 51. The sorting-apparatus described in Specification 9030/09 may be combined with the displayer. A somewhat modified construction is described in the Provisional Specification.",DENTON GEORGE RICHARD,DENTON GEORGE RICHARD,,https://lens.org/024-257-049-090-217,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

This disclosure adds further novel and inventive developments to the cyclonic device which enable it to be used as a separating device for systems involving all three phases (gas, liquid and solid) and where two, three or more different product streams may be separated, all within the same cylindrical profile. These further inventive developments also relate to the use of externally supplied gas and / or additional liquid phases which are injected through the walls of the cyclonic body using specifically located slots and / or holes in combination with specifically located stepped edges. These further novel and inventive developments enable the concepts of froth floatation (FF) and Dispersed Air Floatation (DAF) to be exploited within an enhanced gravitational field together with the options for washing the separated froth and / or the separated heavier fractions, all within the same cyclonic unit. As part of the novel and inventive introduction of the stepped edges, means are provided whereby gas bubbles smaller than 30 microns can be created on a large scale and with a reduced energy input relative to typical conventional equipment. Also, the size of the gas bubbles may be controlled together with the intensity of any particle on particle interactions that may be created. This latter has many potential applications within FF and / or DAF processes, including applications within oil and tar separation from solid surfaces and within many ore preparation and ore leaching processes.

STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES Ltd. 13 Jan., 1967, No. 1852/67. Heading HlK. A gallium arsenide semi-conductor device is made by depositing on the surface of a gallium arsenide body, a silicon layer doped with an acceptor impurity or a donor impurity other than silicon, and heating in an arsenic-free atmosphere to diffuse the impurity into the surface. The layer of silicon acts as a barrier to prevent oxygen diffusion. An epitaxial layer 31 of N-type GaAs is grown on a substrate 32 of N<SP>+</SP> -type GaAs and covered with a silica layer (33, Figs. 3b and 3c, not shown) provided with a window therein. A layer (34) of Zn or Mg doped Si is deposited by sputtering over the oxide film and the window and then heated to give a diffused P-type base region (35). The silica and silicon layers are replaced by another silica layer 36 having a window therein for an emitter region. A pure layer of silicon (37, Figs. 3d and 3e, not shown) is deposited over the silica and the structure heated in an arsenic atmosphere to give a diffused N-type emitter region 38. The silicon in contact with the gallium arsenide recrystallizes and an N<SP>+</SP>-type contact is formed on the emitter region. Alternatively the silicon layer (37) may be doped with As, Sb or P.

Denton, G. R. April 16. Coins, separating .-For sorting coins into receptacles according to denomination, and especially for use in connexion with the cash till described in Specification 863/08, the coins are fed into a sorting-apparatus divided into three compartments for gold, silver, and copper coins respectively. Fig. 1 shows the receptacle for copper coins, the others being similar, the coins as shown being fed into the receptacle from the bar 15 of the till described in the above-mentioned Specification. The coins fall between plates 30, 31 spaced to allow only one coin abreast between them, the plate 30 being recessed for this purpose, the bottom of the recess being inclined and leading to a converging channel 35, down which all the coins pass. From this channel extend three channels 37, 38, 39 leading to boxes 40, 41, 42 for pence, halfpence, and farthings respectively; the entrances to the first two channels are governed by balanced gates 43 and toe-pieces 44; and the channel is provided opposite the entrances with projections 35<x>, 38<x> for directing the coins. The gate 43 of the channel 37 consists of a blade extending through a slot 43<x>, Figs. 2 and 3, in the plate 30, the blade having a projection 45 supported on pins 46 and adjustably balanced by a screw 47, so that the gate tilts under the weight of the lightest penny. The toe-piece 44 is fixed to an arm 48 of a twoarmed lever, the other arm 50 of which acts as a counter-weight and is controlled by an adjustable spring 52, so arranged as to offer increasing resistance to the movement in order to give a quick return to the toe-piece when the arm 48 is moved along the slot 51 in the plate 30. The passage 38 has a similar mechanism for the passage of half-pence. A penny passing down the channel 35 is diverted on to the gate and toepiece by the projection 35<x>. The gate and toepiece are thereby tripped to allow the coin to pass into the channel 37, the toe-piece 44 being released to spring back before the gate 43 can return. If a half-penny follows, it is kicked onwards by the toe-piece as shown in Fig. 2 to pass, down the channel 35 into the channel 38. Farthings similarly are passed on into the channel 39. The coins in their passage down the channels 37, 38, 39 may operate a starwheel in connexion with a counting-mechanism of the type, for instance, of the "" Veeder "" cyclometer, whereby the number of coins may be shown.",DENTON GEORGE RICHARD,DENTON GEORGE RICHARD,,https://lens.org/165-525-827-867-039,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

For example, a PBX can communicate using SIP signaling to a gateway to a PSTN network, to which a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) is coupled, and which a mobile device, uses for voice communication. Controlling or updating status in these kinds of situations can be accomplished by forming a Q.931/932 message, such as a FACILITY message, which has fields (Information Elements) for pre-defined purposes (other than third party call control), and providing control or status information in such field(s).

STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES Ltd. 11 Jan., 1968 [13 Jan., 1967], No. 1851/67. Heading H1K. A method of producing an "" intrinsic "" [semi-insulating] region in an N-type GaAs body comprises diffusing-in oxygen through an oxygen permeable surface layer. The surface layer may be silica and it is stated that oxygen does not convert areas not covered with the oxygen permeable layer. In a first embodiment a PIN diode is pro duced by depositing a layer (3) of silica Fig. 1a (not shown), on the surface of an N-type epitaxial layer 1 on an N + type GaAs substrate 2, and diffusing oxygen through the silica layer to form an intrinsic layer 4, Fig. 1b (not shown). The oxygen is preferably supplied in the form of water vapour. A P+type layer is then produced in the semi-insulating layer 4 by evaporating-on a layer 5 of gold containing zinc at an elevated temperature on to the layer 4, quickly cooling, and evaporating-on a layer 6 of gold at a lower temperature, Fig. 1c (not shown). The electrode is then electroless plated with a layer 7 of nickel followed by a thin layer 8 of gold, Fig. 1d (not shown). The body is cut into mesa diodes, Fig. 1e, which are lightly etched and mounted in individual housings, Fig. 1f (not shown). In a second embodiment, planar type PIN diodes are produced by depositing a layer of silica, removing part of the layer using a photo-resist technique to leave islands, Fig. 2a (not shown), and covering the surface and islands with a second silica layer of equal thickness, Fig. 2b (not shown). Oxygen is then diffused into the body and penetrates to a greater depth in the areas between the islands than in the areas under the islands, Fig. 2c (not shown), so that the breakdown voltage of each diode is determined by the parts of the intrinsic layer under the islands. P + type regions are produced on these thinner parts of the intrinsic layer by the method used in the first embodiment. The body is then cut into individual devices, Fig. 2d (not shown), which are lightly etched and mounted in housings with the electrodes on the P+type regions in contact with copper studs which form heat sinks, Fig. 2e (not shown).",STANDARD TELEPHONES CABLES LTD,ANTELL GEORGE RICHARD,,https://lens.org/067-835-588-117-230,Granted Patent,no,0,0,5,5,0,H01L29/207;;H01L29/207;;H01L29/00;;H01L29/00;;Y10S148/054;;Y10S148/054;;Y10S438/923;;Y10S438/923;;Y10S438/965;;Y10S438/965,H01L29/00;;H01L29/207,H1K KLB           LB;;H1K KLBC          LBC;;H1K K1A1          LB;;H1K K2R3A         LB;;H1K K2R3Y         LB;;H1K K2S1D         LB;;H1K K2S11G        LB;;H1K K2S17         LB;;H1K K2S2D         LB;;H1K K2S27         LB;;H1K K3E1M         LB;;H1K K3E5CY        LB;;H1K K3E5C1        LB;;H1K K3TY          LB;;H1K K4C23         LB;;H1K K4C3Y         LB;;H1K K4C5Y         LB;;H1K K4F11G        LB;;H1K K4F11S        LB;;H1K K4F13         LB;;H1K K4F27         LB;;H1K K4F8C         LB;;H1K K4F9          LB;;H1K K5A           LB;;H1K K5A1          LB;;H1K K5A3          LB;;H1K K5A4          LB;;H1K K5B2          LB;;H1K K5CY          LB;;H1K K5D9          LB;;H1K K5H1          LB;;H1K K8M           LB;;H1K K8P           LB;;H1K K8V3          LB;;H1K K9A           LB;;H1K K9B3          LB;;H1K K9B4X         LB;;H1K K9B9          LB;;H1K K9E           LB;;H1K K9L           LB;;H1K K9N1          LB;;H1K K9N2          LB;;H1K K9N3          LB;;H1K K9R           LB,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Flexible shafts; tube joints. S. SMITH & SONS (ENGLAND) Ltd. 2 July, 1965 [2 July, 1964], No. 27414/64. Headings F2G, F2K and F2U. A connector for the outer casing of a flexible drive shaft 10, transmitting linear or, as in a flexible shaft assembly between a vehicle gearbox and speedometer, rotary motion, comprises a nylon sleeve 18 moulded or cast on to the outer casing and having outwardly flaring prongs 21 encircled by a collar 23 which is axially movable to press the prongs inwardly against a member to which the outer casing is to be connected. The outer casing comprises helically wound flat metal strip 11 covered with an outer layer 12 of P.V.C. The nylon sleeve 18 presses the P.V.C. layer into the space between the helical strip. The prongs 21 may engage the screw-threads of a conventional spigot of a device to which the outer easing is connected, may have inturned ends to engage in a groove in the spigot, or may be ribbed or provided with projections to engage the outer casing of a second flexible shaft. The shaft 10 may have a moulded-on square-section male or female coupling member or an integral male square end. The collar 23 may be a split resilient collar. A dirt or moisture-sealing sleeve or rubber or P.V.C. may be fitted to extend between the outer casing and the outer member of the structure co-operating with the sleeve 18. As shown, the sleeve 18, connecting together the outer casings 12, 25 respectively of two flexible drive shafts 10, 24, has an inner wall 19 and an internal step from which project four prongs 21 provided with inner projections 22 and presenting an increasing outside diameter and an end section of constant outside diameter. The outer casings 12, 25 and the shafts 10, 24 have, at their ends remote from the sleeve 18, moulded-on sleeves carrying captive nuts and integral and moulded-on square-section male coupling ends. The ends of the shafts 10, 24 coupled within the sleeve 18 have respectively a moulded-on square socket 16 and a moulded-on or integral square male end 26. The moulded-on sleeve and captive nut at the end of the outer casing 12 remote from the sleeve 18 may be replaced by the connector according to the invention. The shafts 10, 24 are respectively axially located by the engagement of the socket 16 and the inner wall 19 and a similar engagement of parts within the moulded-on sleeve of the outer casing 25. Injection moulding may be used for the sleeve 18 and the socket 16. The shaft may comprise a core around which steel wire is helically wound. To ensure full insertion of the shaft 24 in the socket 16 the outer casing 25 carries a mark to be aligned with the ends of the prongs 21. The sleeve 18 may have an integrally moulded annular internal projection near the base of the prongs to form a dirt-seal with a co-operating spigot.",SMITHS INDUSTRIES LTD,TILBURY RICHARD GEORGE,,https://lens.org/108-061-101-043-137,Granted Patent,no,0,5,1,1,0,F16C1/08;;F16C1/06,F16C1/12,F2G G4J           G4J;;F2G G4J2          G4J;;F2K K2A2          -;;F2K K2C2          -;;F2K K2E1          -;;F2K K2E2          -;;F2K K2X3          -;;F2U U13A          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Jan. 14., Tills.-A till, having an open change drawer in which a constant sum is kept, is provided with separate shoots for different denominations of coin, and separate rows of compartments for the coins inserted at each transaction, and with mechanism by means of which, after the coins received have been placed in the compartments, a movement is given to these compartments whereby the coins from several transactions are kept in view until released from the compartments and dropped into a suitable receptacle. The till consists of two parallel glass plates 6, 7, mounted on a base-piece, which may contain the change-drawer, and united by end pieces 1, 2 and a top piece 4, in which is a partitioned shoot 5. Extending between the end pieces are shafts 12, 13 fitted with sprocket-wheels carrying endless chains 14 in which are fixed parallel bars 15, which work between the plates 6, 7 and inside the back-plate 11. The chains divide the space 16 between the plates vertically into compartments, the plates being divided to allow the chains to pass. The bars 15 form revoluble shelves on which the coins rest, the different compartments 17, 18, 19 between the chains carrying coins of different denominations. A push-rod 20 is fitted at one end and is normally held up by a spring 22, Figs. 1 and 3. It has rack teeth 23 gearing with a wheel 24, which gears with a spurwheel loose on the shaft 12. This spur-wheel carries a disk 25 bearing a pawl adapted to engage a ratchet-wheel 26 on the shaft 12. At the end of the rod 20 is a lever 27 co-acting with the tail of a balanced pawl 28, which engages a ratchet-wheel 29 on the shaft 13. When a coin is tendered and change is required, the salesman places the coin in the change-drawer and extracts an equivalent amount of change. The amount of the change is then handed over, and the amount of the purchase is inserted through a shoot 5 into the uppermost row of compartments. The rod 20 is then depressed, tripping the pawl 28 and freeing the shaft 13, at the same time revolving the shaft 12 through the rack 23, the train of wheels, and the pawl and ratchet 26. The bars 15 are thus caused to descend one step, closing the compartments containing the coins last inserted, and allowing the coins on the lowest bar to fall between guide-plates 30, 31 into the receiver. During the downward movement of the rod 20, the pawl 28 escapes from the lever 27 and locks the shaft 13 in its new position until the rod is again depressed, the lever 27 passing the pawl inoperatively as the rod 20 rises. The movement of the rod 20 may actuate a counting-mechanism to show the number of times the rod is operated.",DENTON GEORGE RICHARD,DENTON GEORGE RICHARD,,https://lens.org/035-521-279-695-878,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

After forming a P doped region in an N type monocrystalline silicon body and masking it with an insulator (e.g. dual oxide-nitride) layer, the highly doped N region (hereafter, N+ region) is formed in a portion of the P doped region by selectively opening the insulator layer and introducing N dopant therethrough. This opening also serves as contact opening for the N+ region. Contact opening for the P region is formed by selectively etching the insulator layer. The structure is subjected to a low temperature steam oxidation to from an oxide layers in the P contact and N+ contact regions, the oxide in the N+ contact being about 3-5 times thicker than that in the P contact region due to the significantly higher oxidation rate of the N+ region relative to the P doped region. The oxide in the P contact is etched off while retaining a substantial portion of the oxide grown in the N+ contact region. P type dopant is then introduced into the P contact opening to achieve solid solubility limit of the P dopant species in silicon. The oxide remaining in the N+ contact region is removed and contact metallurgy is established with all contacts.

REYNOLDS METALS CO. 14 March, 1967 [17 March, 1966], No. 11982/67. Heading B6G. [Also in Division C7] Decorative patterns are produced on an anodizable metal surface, such as sheet or extruded aluminium metal or alloy, by anodizing the surface to produce a first anodic coat thereon, applying a resist layer to selected areas of the first coat, anodizing areas unprotected by the resist layer to produce thereon a second anodic coat while leaving the resist layer in place, thoroughly sealing the coats and then removing the resist to expose the entire pattern. The resist material, e.g. a vinyl fluoride-vinyl acetate copolymer dissolved in ketone with silicone resin, may be applied by silk screening, stenciling, or masking and spraying. The first anodic coat may be partially sealed before applying the resist and the coat removed from the unprotected areas, e.g. by caustic etching, to expose metal on which the second anodic coat is formed of different appearance, e.g. a darker colour from the first. Before final removal of the resist, a further resist layer may be applied to selected areas and the areas unprotected by such resist layer anodized to form a further anodic coat thereon of different appearance, e.g. again a darker colour from the first and second coats, the steps being repeated with or without sealing and etching until the desired number of coats is attained. Where the anodic coating has been rinsed and dried without sealing, removal of coating is unnecessary. A 3-D gold-bronze-black design may be produced on Al sheet by successive anodizing in an aqueous bath containing 5-20% H 2 SO 4 , or sulphosalicylic or sulphophthalic acid with H 2 SO 4 . For multicolour anodizing, an electrolyte containing 0À05-4À5% H 2 SO 4 , 0À5-9% oxalic acid and 0À5-8% ferric oxalate may be used, the voltage being raised during each anodizing step; the current density may vary from 10 to 60 ASF. The final removal of the resist may be effected by a suitable organic solvent, e.g. methyl-isobutyl or ethyl ketone, or isophorone. Partial sealing may be effected in distilled or deionized water at 205-212 F. for 3 minutes. The Al surface may be prepared for anodizing by degreasing in an alkaline bath, rinsing, caustic etched and desmutled in dilute nitric acid.",REYNOLDS METALS CO,DARROW GEORGE RICHARD,,https://lens.org/185-982-960-628-378,Granted Patent,no,0,3,2,2,0,C25D11/14;;C25D11/12;;C25D11/022;;C25D11/246;;C25D11/14;;C25D11/022;;C25D11/12;;C25D11/246,C25D11/14,B6G GNB           GNB(104);;B6G G1A           -;;B6G G104          GNB(104);;B6G G3B           -;;C7B BCPE          CPE;;C7B BEC           EC12;;C7B B124          EC12;;C7B B13           -;;C7B B15B          -;;C7B B15X          -;;C7B B16X          -;;C7B B2F           -;;C7B B301          EC12;;C7B B320          EC12;;C7B B325          EC12;;C7B B422          EC12;;C7B B684          EC12;;C7B B687          EC12;;C7B B770          EC12,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Hildyard, G. R. Jan. 10. Tune-sheets.-In a music-recorder for pianos and similar instruments, wicks or pads are used for conveying ink to a moving sheet of paper. The recording-levers are operated by gravity or spring action upon the depression of the keys, so that the impact against the paper is independent of the force applied to the keys. The marks formed on the paper may be cut away, thus forming a tune-sheet for automatic musical instruments. Levers p carrying weights r are pivotally mounted at q. A wick n passes through an extension w on each of the levers and dips into a trough o containing ink. Alternatively, the extensions m may be dispensed with, the wicks passing through holes or notches in the levers. A pad k is provided at the top of each wick n. The paper 7 is wound from a roller 5 over a plate h and grooved member j to a roller 6. An adjustable block 4 is mounted above the gap between the plate h and grooved member j. Alternatively, a roller may be carried above the pads k. The weights r are arranged between guide-plates s spaced apart by blocks t. Rods d, which rest upon the keys a, pass freely through the guides s, x, b and terminate immediately beneath the weights r. The rods d may be provided with devices 2 and feet which can be rotated for the purpose of adjusting the lengths of the rods. Springs w, which tend to pull down the weights r, may also be provided. When a key a is depressed, the corresponding rod d falls. permitting the weight r to move downwards and a pad k to rise and mark the moving sheet 7.

The spacing between pairs of depending poweroperated gripping members 13, Figs. 1 and 3, may be altered by moving them along their supporting frame 1, 2, 3. The minimum spacing between the gripping members of a pair may also be adjustable. As shown, each pair of gripping members comprises plates 13 and crossbars 12 carried by tapered members 11, Fig. 2, secured to pairs of 1-section beams 10 which slide within boxsection guides 9 carried by shoes 8 slidable on the longitudinal frame members and adjustably secured on the frame members 1 by clamps 25. The gripping members 13 of a pair are moved towards and away from one another by double - acting hydraulic or pneumatic rams 16 connected through valves 18, which lock the members 13 if the power fails, and a common valve 21 to a source 22 of pressure fluid carried by the frame. Heads 15, Fig. 3, on the piston-rods of the rams 16 are connected to the cross-bars 12 by pairs of bars 14 formed with holes 24 in which take pins 23 secured by bayonet fittings in the heads 15. Alternative holes in the bars 14 permit the minimum distance between the gripping members 13 to be adjusted. The frame is preferably of a light metal alloy and carries eyes 4 for connection by cables 5 to a ring 6 by which the grab may be supported from the crane. Preferred dimensions are given in the Specification. The gripping members may be curved.

Apparatus for performing repetitive operations on a cylindrical workpiece automatically, e.g. drilling holes or welding studs on the work periphery, in which the work is moved about its longitudinal axis and also fed axially, comprises a base 5, Fig. 1, a runway 6 supporting the ends of the work by supports 7, a device 15 for rotating and feeding the work axially, and a clamp 12, operable when the feeding-device is released and the welding equipment 29 is operating. The feeding-device comprises shoes 16, Fig. 4, connected to arms 15 which grip the work 8 when a pneumatic double-acting cylinder 17 moves the arms about a pivot 15a. A similar cylinder 22 is connected to one of the pins 18 on the arm 15 by a yoke 20, the pins being guided in plates 23 adjustably bolted to plates 19, the latter being adjustable to the vertical so that, when the feeding-device is rotated by the cylinder 22, it will also move axially. The clamping-device comprises shoes 13, Fig. 3, connected to arms 12, which clamp the work when a pneumatic cylinder 14 is' actuated, the device being fixed against rotation. Tn operation, the work 8 is supported by two sets of adjustable-rollers 10 secured to frames 9, cylinder 17 is actuated and the shoes 16 grip the work; the cylinder 22 is then actuated, thus turning the work and feeding it axially according to the setting of guide-strips 23 on plates 19. The cylinder 14 is actuated, and the work is clamped by shoes 13. Cylinders 17, 22, are then reversed to return the feeding-device to its initial position, and a stud is welded to the work. Cylinder 14 then releases the workclamp, and as the operations are repeated, the studs are welded to the work in a helical path. The pitch of the studs can be varied by adjusting the stroke of cylinder 22, or by limiting'the stroke by stops 31. The machine is automatically-controlled by a cam 26 driven by a motor 25 and controlling valves for cylinders 14, 17, 22, and for the operation of the tool &c. 29. The welding-machine may incorporate a vibratory feed-bowl 28 and a magazine 29 from which one stud is fed and arc-welded at each operation.",BIRWELCO LTD,LEWIS RICHARD GEORGE,,https://lens.org/129-962-491-563-460,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,B21C37/22;;B23K11/0053,B21C37/22;;B23K11/00,B3B BCM7          BCM7;;B3C C1A7          C1A7;;B3C C1B8F         C1A7;;B3C C1B8J         C1A7,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Zinc or cadmium is diffused into a body 1 of N-type gallium arsenide to form a P-type base region 5, and silicon is diffused under arsenic pressure into part of the base region to form an N-type emitter region 8. As shown, the base region 5 is formed by diffusion from a surface layer 4 of silica originally containing zinc oxide or cadmium oxide, this layer being provided by sputtering in an oxidizing atmosphere using a silicon electrode on which zinc or cadmium is placed.

IMPERIAL CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES OF AUSTRALIA & NEW ZEALAND Ltd. Dec. 19, 1960, No. 43656/60. Class 40 (3). A range of wavelengths in a beam of light, ultra-violet or infra-red radiation is scanned by passing the beam into an absorbing medium and applying either the Zeeman or Stark effect to the source of the beam or the absorbing medium. An emission spectral line in the light beam 10, Fig. 1, is investigated by putting a gas in the chamber 12 which has an absorption line near the emission line, splitting the absorption line with the Zeeman effect provided by the coils 20, removing one split component with a nicol prism 14 and a quarter-wave plate 15, varying the current in coils 20 to scan the remaining component relative to the emission line and recording the variation of output of a photomultiplier 17 on XY recorder or oscilloscope 19. In Fig. 2 (not shown), the resonant radiation is measured to indicate the absorption. Measurement of partial pressures.-Light from a lamp 40, Fig. 5, excites resonance in a chamber 43 to an extent dependent upon the concentration of the scattering atoms and this is detected by a photo-cell 45, compared with the output of a correction photo-cell 47 and recorded. To eliminate variations due to line shift and broadening the whole line is scanned and the output integrated. Measurement of temperature.-Source temperature is measured by scanning the emission line with a narrow absorption line to determine the Doppler broadening. The temperature of an absorber is determined by measuring the half-width of a line absorbed from a continuum, or by scanning the absorption line with a narrow emission line. Isotope analysis.-An isotope mixture in the source or absorber is investigated using a pure isotope in the absorber or source, respectively. The relative intensity of the emission or absorption lines due to the individual isotopes indicates the relative abundance. The isotopes investigated may be in the upper atmospherestrontium, lithium or sodium fluorescing under excitation by the sun, auroral electrons or cosmic rays. Measurement of gas velocity.-Light frdm a source 51, Fig. 6, is passed in two different directions through a wind tunnel into which has been introduced atoms of an absorbing gas. The emission line is shifted by the Zeeman effect to scan the absorption lines on the two paths and the Doppler shift therebetween indicates the wind tunnel gas velocity. The velocity of gas in the upper atmosphere is measured by scanning the fluorescence therefrom with an absorption line and determining the Doppler shift and broadening of the line.

After concrete is placed in the lower section and additional rows of insulated forms are placed on top of the lower wall, a vertical brace is attached to the lower vertical member so that it extends above the lower poured section of the wall. A vertical upper member is then attached to the upper section of the insulated form wall in proper alignment with the vertical brace. A securing adjustment device is attached to the upper member and the brace allowing for the upper section of the formed wall to be properly aligned and plumbed.

This disclosure adds further novel and inventive developments to the cyclonic device which enable it to be used as a separating device for systems involving all three phases (gas, liquid and solid) and where two, three or more different product streams may be separated, all within the same cylindrical profile. These further inventive developments also relate to the use of externally supplied gas and/or additional liquid phases which are injected through the walls of the cyclonic body using specifically located slots and/or holes in combination with specifically located stepped edges. These further novel and inventive developments enable the concepts of froth floatation (FF) and Dispersed Air Floatation (DAF) to be exploited within an enhanced gravitational field together with the options for washing the separated froth and/or the separated heavier fractions, all within the same cyclonic unit. As part of the novel and inventive introduction of the stepped edges, means are provided whereby gas bubbles smaller than 30 microns can be created on a large scale and with a reduced energy input relative to typical conventional equipment. Also, the size of the gas bubbles may be controlled together with the intensity of any particle on particle interactions that may be created. This latter has many potential applications within FF and/or DAF processes, including applications within oil and tar separation from solid surfaces and within many ore preparation and ore leaching processes. The tubular profile enables processing and separation to be achieved “within the pipe line” or for very closely packed arrangements to be assembled within carrier vessels.",CYDAF TECHNOLOGIES LTD,PAXTON RICHARD GEORGE,CYDAF TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED (2014-03-26),https://lens.org/187-446-850-354-71X,Granted Patent,yes,7,2,14,14,0,B01D45/16;;B04C5/10;;B04C5/06;;B04C5/103;;B04C5/13;;B04C5/14;;B04C5/28;;B01D21/2411;;B01D21/267;;B03D1/1418;;B01D17/0217;;B01D19/0057;;B01D47/00;;B01D45/16;;B04C5/10;;B04C5/06;;B04C5/103;;B04C5/13;;B04C5/14;;B04C5/28;;B01D21/2411;;B01D21/267;;B03D1/1418;;B01D17/0217;;B01D19/0057;;B01F23/232,B01D45/16;;B01D17/02;;B01D19/00;;B01D21/24;;B01D21/26;;B01D47/00;;B01F3/04;;B03D1/14;;B04C5/06;;B04C5/10;;B04C5/103;;B04C5/13;;B04C5/14;;B04C5/28,,2,0,,,"International Search Report for PCT/IB2012/055035 prepared by European Patent Office, mailed Mar. 15, 2013, 2 pages.;;International Preliminary Report on Patentability for PCT/1B2012/055035 prepared by European Patent Office; completed Jan. 1, 2014, 26 pages.",ACTIVE

This disclosure adds further novel and inventive developments to the cyclonic device which enable it to be used as a separating device for systems involving all three phases (gas, liquid and solid) and where two, three or more different product streams may be separated, all within the same cylindrical profile. These further inventive developments also relate to the use of externally supplied gas and / or additional liquid phases which are injected through the walls of the cyclonic body using specifically located slots and / or holes in combination with specifically located stepped edges. These further novel and inventive developments enable the concepts of froth floatation (FF) and Dispersed Air Floatation (DAF) to be exploited within an enhanced gravitational field together with the options for washing the separated froth and / or the separated heavier fractions, all within the same cyclonic unit. As part of the novel and inventive introduction of the stepped edges, means are provided whereby gas bubbles smaller than 30 microns can be created on a large scale and with a reduced energy input relative to typical conventional equipment. Also, the size of the gas bubbles may be controlled together with the intensity of any particle on particle interactions that may be created. This latter has many potential applications within FF and / or DAF processes, including applications within oil and tar separation from solid surfaces and within many ore preparation and ore leaching processes.

After forming a P doped region in an N type monocrystalline silicon body and masking it with an insulator (e.g. dual oxide-nitride) layer, the highly doped N region (hereafter, N+ region) is formed in a portion of the P doped region by selectively opening the insulator layer and introducing N dopant therethrough. This opening also serves as contact opening for the N+ region. Contact opening for the P region is formed by selectively etching the insulator layer. The structure is subjected to a low temperature steam oxidation to from an oxide layers in the P contact and N+ contact regions, the oxide in the N+ contact being about 3-5 times thicker than that in the P contact region due to the significantly higher oxidation rate of the N+ region relative to the P doped region. The oxide in the P contact is etched off while retaining a substantial portion of the oxide grown in the N+ contact region. P type dopant is then introduced into the P contact opening to achieve solid solubility limit of the P dopant species in silicon.

Starting with a semiconductor substrate having a blanket N+ NPN subcollector and an epitaxial layer thereon having first and second active regions, and NPN base precursor and PNP collector reach-through precursor are simultaneously implanted in the first and second active regions, respectively. PNP collector is then formed in the second active region by implanting P type species to lodge them at the bottom the epitaxial layer. PNP base precursor is then implanted in the surface region of the epitaxial layer in the second active region. By annealing, the NPN and PNP bases and PNP collector reach-through are obtained from their respective precursors.

This disclosure adds further novel and inventive developments to the cyclonic device which enable it to be used as a separating device for systems involving all three phases (gas, liquid and solid) and where two, three or more different product streams may be separated, all within the same cylindrical profile. These further inventive developments also relate to the use of externally supplied gas and/or additional liquid phases which are injected through the walls of the cyclonic body using specifically located slots and/or holes in combination with specifically located stepped edges. These further novel and inventive developments enable the concepts of froth floatation (FF) and Dispersed Air Floatation (DAF) to be exploited within an enhanced gravitational field together with the options for washing the separated froth and/or the separated heavier fractions, all within the same cyclonic unit. As part of the novel and inventive introduction of the stepped edges, means are provided whereby gas bubbles smaller than 30 microns can be created on a large scale and with a reduced energy input relative to typical conventional equipment. Also the size of the gas bubbles may be controlled together with the intensity of any particle on particle interactions that may be created. This latter has many potential applications within FF and/or DAF processes, including applications within oil and tar separation from solid surfaces and within many ore preparation and ore leaching processes. The tubular profile enables processing and separation to be achieved “within the pipe line” or for very closely packed arrangements to be assembled within carrier vessels.",CYDAF TECHNOLOGIES LTD,PAXTON RICHARD GEORGE,CYDAF TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED (2014-03-26),https://lens.org/092-739-307-773-730,Patent Application,yes,3,20,14,14,0,B01D45/16;;B04C5/10;;B04C5/06;;B04C5/103;;B04C5/13;;B04C5/14;;B04C5/28;;B01D21/2411;;B01D21/267;;B03D1/1418;;B01D17/0217;;B01D19/0057;;B01D47/00;;B01D45/16;;B04C5/10;;B04C5/06;;B04C5/103;;B04C5/13;;B04C5/14;;B04C5/28;;B01D21/2411;;B01D21/267;;B03D1/1418;;B01D17/0217;;B01D19/0057;;B01F23/232,B01F3/04,261/79.2,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Transistor switching circuit; gas filled tube bi-stable circuits. G. R. HOFFMAN. 23 Dec., 1968 [13 Jan., 1968], No. 2029/68. Headings H3P and H3T. [Also in Division G5] A control apparatus for a gaseous discharge tube display device of the rectangular matrix type comprises two control matrices (one shown in Fig. 3), for addressing the row and column conductors respectively of the display matrix (Figs. 1, 2, not shown). Each control matrix respectively supplies fixed "" sustain "" voltages V ht (of opposite polarity), and also switching pulses V t . It comprises pulse transformers T 0 -T 1023 whose primary windings are connected between row and column lines whose respective potentials are controlled by separate switching devices TY 0 -TY 31 and TX 1 -TX 31 ; these are in their turn controlled by actuating means (e.g. a computer, not shown), to supply the requisite switching pulses to a selected tube. As described, the display matrix comprises an array of 1024 x 1024 gas tubes, operated in bi-stable fashion. Yet there are only 128 signal input lines: each tube is actuated by a unique selection of 4 such lines. The duration of the input signal on one such line determines whether the tube is ignited or extinguished. General layout.-The circuit shown in Fig. 3 selects one of the column conductors x 0 -x 1023 of the display matrix. A complementary circuit (not shown) selects one of the row conductors (Y 0 -Y 1023 ). As shown, by choosing in the control matrix a row line, e.g. Y 0 , and a column line, e.g. X 1 , Fig. 3, a unique column conductor of the display matrix, i.e. x 1 , is selected. Thus to select any one gas tube, a total of four lines are chosen, in contrast to the conventional arrangement where only two conductors are selected. Memory system.-The gas tubes work at a voltage V ht = 250; extinguish at (V ht - V t ) = 150; and ignite at (V ht + V t ) = 350. In other words, each tube is bi-stable, being switched by pulses V t . In one method, a waveform Y, Figs. 5, is supplied to a selected row conductor. To ignite the tube (or leave it unaffected, if already lit), waveform X, Fig. 5a, is supplied to the selected column conductor. Between times t 2 and t 3 the net tube voltage is = 350, so the tube ignites. To extinguish a tube, waveform X, Fig. 5b, replaces waveform X. Extinction occurs between times t 1 and t 2 , and the ensuing 300 volt p.d. is insufficient to re-ignite it. The circuit of Fig. 3 not only selects the desired column conductor, but also applies the appropriate "" ignite "" (X) or "" extinguish "" (X) pulse to it. Selecting a column conductor; switching a tube (Fig. 3).-Pulse transformers T 0 -T 1023 are connected at the crossovers of row lines Y 0 -Y 31 and column lines X 0 - 31 . The "" X "" lines are connected to a constant current source C through column transistors TX 0 -TX 31 to potential - V t through catching diodes DX 0 -DX 31 ; and to potential - ¢Vt through resistors RX 0 -RX 31 . The "" Y "" lines are connected to row transistors TY 0 -TY 31 whose emitters are at potential - ¢V t . Transistor Z is a current sink. At the start, the diodes ""DX"" and ""DT"" are reverse biased by a voltage ¢V t . If a control signal is applied to (say) input IY 0 , this switches transistor TY 0 and unbiases the diodes DT 0 to DT 31 . Similarly, a signal on (say) input IX, to switch driver transistor TI, unbiases diodes DT 1 , DT 33 ... DT 993 . A linearly increasing current flows in the primary of transformer T 1 , the corresponding secondary voltage being shown at a, Fig. 5a. If, as soon as the current reaches a maximum, the signal on input IX, is removed (Fig. 4b, not shown), the current decays linearly to zero and the resulting voltage is shown at b, Fig. 5a. This provides waveform X (of which waveform Y, generated in the other control matrix, is merely an inverse). To get waveform X, the signal on IX, is not removed as soon as the current reaches a maximum (Fig. 4a, not shown). Therefore the output voltage only drops to c, Fig. 5b. Thus to ignite the selected tube a short voltage pulse is applied to IX 1 , and a longer pulse is applied to extinguish it; these pulses may be applied by a computer. Modifications.-In another form, Fig. 6 (not shown), the annoying tube "" ringing "" effect is reduced by connecting a clamping transistor (TC) to each of the lines X 0 -X 31 . When switched on it prevents the output waveform from going negative by more than - ¢V ht , i.e. it inhibits waveform X. To allow waveform X, transistor (TC) is switched off during an appropriate part of the cycle.",HOFFMAN GEORGE RICHARD,HOFFMAN GEORGE RICHARD,,https://lens.org/150-560-871-366-572,Granted Patent,no,0,0,5,5,0,G09G3/282;;G09G2310/0267;;G09G2310/0275;;G09G2300/088;;G09G3/282;;G09G2310/0275;;G09G2310/0267;;G09G2300/088,G09G3/28;;G09G3/282,G5C CA310         CHB(2);;G5C CA333         CHB(2);;G5C CA350         CHB(2);;G5C CHB           CHB(2);;G5C C310          C31;;G5C C333          C31;;G5C C350          C31;;H3P PABXX         PABXX(V);;H3P PG1M          -;;H3P PG2A          -;;H3P PG2G          -;;H3P PG2L          PG;;H3P PG2T          -;;H3T TCX           TCX;;H3T T1C2          -;;H3T T1PX          -;;H3T T2A1N         -;;H3T T2A1S         -;;H3T T2B2          -;;H3T T2J           -;;H3T T2RX          -;;H3T T2T3J         -;;H3T T2V           -;;H3T T2W2          -;;H3T T3X           -;;H3T T4C           -;;H3T T4D           -;;H3T T4E1N         -;;H3T T5E           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

This disclosure adds further novel and inventive developments to the cyclonic device which enable it to be used as a separating device for systems involving all three phases (gas, liquid and solid) and where two, three or more different product streams may be separated, all within the same cylindrical profile. These further inventive developments also relate to the use of externally supplied gas and / or additional liquid phases which are injected through the walls of the cyclonic body using specifically located slots and / or holes in combination with specifically located stepped edges. These further novel and inventive developments enable the concepts of froth floatation (FF) and Dispersed Air Floatation (DAF) to be exploited within an enhanced gravitational field together with the options for washing the separated froth and / or the separated heavier fractions, all within the same cyclonic unit. As part of the novel and inventive introduction of the stepped edges, means are provided whereby gas bubbles smaller than 30 microns can be created on a large scale and with a reduced energy input relative to typical conventional equipment. Also, the size of the gas bubbles may be controlled together with the intensity of any particle on particle interactions that may be created. This latter has many potential applications within FF and / or DAF processes, including applications within oil and tar separation from solid surfaces and within many ore preparation and ore leaching processes. The tubular profile enables processing and separation to be achieved ""within the pipe line"" or for very closely packed arrangements to be assembled within carrier vessels.",CYDAF TECHNOLOGIES LTD,PAXTON RICHARD GEORGE,,https://lens.org/154-408-037-616-575,Patent Application,no,0,0,14,14,0,B01D45/16;;B04C5/10;;B04C5/06;;B04C5/103;;B04C5/13;;B04C5/14;;B04C5/28;;B01D21/2411;;B01D21/267;;B03D1/1418;;B01D17/0217;;B01D19/0057;;B01D47/00;;B01D45/16;;B04C5/10;;B04C5/06;;B04C5/103;;B04C5/13;;B04C5/14;;B04C5/28;;B01D21/2411;;B01D21/267;;B03D1/1418;;B01D17/0217;;B01D19/0057;;B01F23/232,B01D45/16;;B03D1/14;;B04C5/10;;B04C7/00,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

Cathode materials and processing. RCA CORPORATION. 8 March, 1968 [10 March, 1967], No. 11517/68. Heading H1D. A photocathode comprises in successive layers on an insulating substrate 20, a layer of tin oxide 30, a layer of antimony oxide 34 and a photoemissive layer 32 including antimony which is preferably activated by an alkali metal. The tin oxide layer 30 may be 0À1 to 1À0 microns thick and formed by spraying a solution of tin oxide in alcohol on to a glass support 20 heated to 500‹ C., Fig. 4 (not shown). The antimony oxide layer 34 may be formed by evaporating antimony on to the tin oxide in a vacuum to 100 to 300 A thickness (or until light transmission drops to 50%) and then oxidizing by means of a glow discharge in oxygen at 0À1 to 1À0 torr, Fig. 5 (not shown). Preferably antimony oxide layer 34 is made up of two to five separately formed sublayers. A further non-oxidized coating of antimony is applied over layer 34 prior to incorporating the photocathode in a discharge device, e.g. the proximity focus type image tube shown in Fig. 1. The photocathode mounted in the tube spaced 100 mils. from phosphor screen 27 and secured to re-entrant ring 18 may be activated by successive depositions of potassium and caesium from generators 36. The spacing between re-entrant ring 18 and ring 16 which seals the two cylindrical ceramic envelope portions 12, 14 is made large enough to permit adequate migration of alkali metal from generator 36 into the interelectrode space and at the same time is small enough to protect the generators from the high field, e.g. 15,000 volts, existing between the electrodes.",RCA RADIO CORP OF AMERICA,STOUDENHEIMER RICHARD GEORGE,,https://lens.org/179-494-723-953-062,Granted Patent,no,0,1,3,3,0,H01J9/12;;H01J29/38,H01J9/12;;H01J29/38,H1D DAF1          AF1;;H1D DPC           PC;;H1D D17C          CA;;H1D D34           CA;;H1D D4A2X         CA;;H1D D4A2Y         CA;;H1D D4A4          CA;;H1D D4K2B         CA;;H1D D4K2C         CA;;H1D D4K2E         CA;;H1D D4K2Y         CA;;H1D D4K3B         CA;;H1D D7C           CA;;H1D D9CY          CA;;H1D D9C1X         CA;;H1D D9C1Y         CA;;H1D D9C2          CA;;H1D D9D           CA;;H1D D9FY          CA;;H1D D9F1          CA;;H1D D9Y           CA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

For example, a PBX can communicate using SIP signaling to a gateway to a PSTN network, to which a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) is coupled, and which a mobile device, uses for voice communication. Controlling or updating status in these kinds of situations can be accomplished by forming a Q.931/932 message, such as a FACILITY message, which has fields (Information Elements) for pre-defined purposes (other than third party call control), and providing control or status information in such field(s). The message (the info) is tunneled through the gateway and the network(s), and arrives at its destination device.

Inshaw, G. R. July 24. Variable-speed gearing; clutches.-A friction clutch allowing slip to a variable extent is combined with an epicyclic gear train to form a change-speed and reversing driving-gear which adjusts itself automatically with the load. It is regarded as a development upon the forms of gear described in Specifications Nos. 1096 and 23,874, A.D. 1906, and as being specially suitable for motor-vehicles. For all forward speeds, the drive is transmitted through a clutch 3 from the motor-shaft 1 to a bevel-gear 4 loose on an intermediate shaft 2. A boss 5 secured to the shaft 2 carries radial spindles 6 with planetgears 7 meshing with the gear 4 and with a second loose gear 8. The highest speed is obtained when the gear 8 is clutched to the shaft 2 by the friction clutch members 9, 10. The lowest forward speed is obtained when the members 9, 10 are disengaged and the gear 8 is prevented from rotating backwards by a ratchet clutch 15. Intermediate speeds are produced by allowing relative slip of the members 9, 10. The members 10 are connected by struts 11 to a sleeve 12 which slides on a feather &c. on the shaft 2 operated by an automatic coupling 21. The coupling 21 comprises saw teeth on the sleeve 12 coacting with like teeth on a tail-shaft 20 in such a way that a heavy load causes relative rotation of the parts and a sliding movement of the sleeve 12 against the action of springs 13. The consequent part release of the clutch 9, 10 reduces the speed transmitted. For reversed driving, the clutch 3 is disengaged, and a train of gearing 26, 23, 24, 27 is brought into action.",INSHAW GEORGE RICHARD,INSHAW GEORGE RICHARD,,https://lens.org/045-012-102-828-679,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,F16H3/721,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

A typical device is formed from an N-type wafer with faces lying in 100 planes by coating one face with zinc-doped silica and after heating to form a diffused PN junction at a depth of 5 m removing the residual silica and cleaving the wafer along a 110 plane. Another gallium arsenide wafer with parallel edges cleaved along 110 planes is placed on the diffused face of the wafer with the cleaved 110 edges of the two wafers abutting a straight edge. Silicon is then sputtered on to the surface of the diffused wafer not masked by the second wafer and subsequently diffused to form a second PN junction 4 m from the surface. After lapping material from the back face, silica is deposited on the diffused face of the wafer and then removed except where the second junction intersects the face. Electrode layers are provided on the P and N zones and the wafer cleaved along 110 planes into thin strips which are mounted on heat dissipating electrodes 104 as shown in Fig. 10. On forward biasing light emission is concentrated in part 107 of the second junction and can be extinguished by suitably biasing region 101 to effectively short circuit region 109 as in a punch through transistor. In another embodiment (Fig. 5, not shown) which is otherwise basically the same, the silicon is diffused right through a zinc doped layer and the electrode 104 omitted. Other devices (Figs. 1-3, not shown) simply comprise one or more silicon diffused regions forming PN junctions with a P-type wafer, electrodes being disposed on the diffused regions and wafer proper.",STANDARD TELEPHONES CABLES LTD,ANTELL GEORGE RICHARD,,https://lens.org/074-607-954-227-43X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,5,6,0,H01L21/2258;;H01L33/0008;;H01L33/0062;;H01L21/02244;;H01L21/31683;;H01L33/0062;;H01L21/2258;;H01L33/0008,H01L21/225;;H01L21/316;;H01L33/00,C3S S43Y          -;;C3S S66Y          -;;C3S S68X          -;;C3S S68Y          -;;C3S S71Y          -;;C3S S714          -;;C3S S730          -;;C3S S731          -;;C3S S733          -;;C4S S43Y          -;;C4S S66Y          -;;C4S S68X          -;;C4S S68Y          -;;C4S S71Y          -;;C4S S714          -;;C4S S730          -;;C4S S731          -;;C4S S733          -;;H1C CCC           CCC;;H1C C208          -;;H1C C214          -;;H1C C22Y          -;;H1C C23Y          -;;H1C C230          -;;H1C C231          -;;H1C C233          -;;H1C C24Y          -;;H1C C25Y          -;;H1C C26Y          -;;H1C C35Y          -;;H1C C352          -;;H1C C353          -;;H1C C36Y          -;;H1C C361          -;;H1C C366          -;;H1C C383          -;;H1C C384          -;;H1C C39Y          -;;H1C C392          -;;H1C C394          -;;H1C C459          -;;H1C C475          -;;H1C C476          -;;H1C C647          -;;H1C C660          -;;H1C C723          -;;H1C C724          -;;H1C C73Y          -;;H1C C744          -;;H1C C748          -;;H1C C78Y          -;;H1C C782          -;;H1C C783          -;;H1C C784          -;;H1K KLBB          LBB;;H1K K1A1          LB;;H1K K1CX          LB;;H1K K11C4         LB;;H1K K11D          LB;;H1K K11D1         LB;;H1K K11Y          LB;;H1K K2R3A         LB;;H1K K2R3Y         LB;;H1K K2S1D         LB;;H1K K2S2D         LB;;H1K K2S20         LB;;H1K K2S27         LB;;H1K K3E1M         LB;;H1K K3E5CY        LB;;H1K K3E5C1        LB;;H1K K3SY          LB;;H1K K3S6          LB;;H1K K4C2U         LB;;H1K K4C23         LB;;H1K K5B2          LB;;H1K K5CY          LB;;H1K K5C3G         LB;;H1K K5D9          LB;;H1K K7L           LB;;H1K K8M           LB;;H1K K8P           LB;;H1K K8V3          LB;;H1K K9C           LB;;H1K K9C1          LB;;H1K K9N2          LB;;H1K K9N3          LB;;H1K K9R           LB,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

For example, a PBX can communicate using SIP signaling to a gateway to a PSTN network, to which a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) is coupled, and which a mobile device, uses for voice communication. Controlling or updating status in these kinds of situations can be accomplished by forming a Q.931/932 message, such as a FACILITY message, which has fields (Information Elements) for pre-defined purposes (other than third party call control), and providing control or status information in such field(s). The message (the info) is tunneled through the gateway and the network(s), and arrives at its destination device. That device determines that a field does not comport with a valid format interpretation, and on that basis, can determine that the field has contents to be interpreted as call control or status information.

Hildyard, G. R. July 15. Overlays and make-ready arrangements. - In a process for printing in more than one colour, all the colours are printed in succession from one plate with the tones in relief by means of separate make-readies each having the parts in relief for printing its own colour. On the plate, which may be of zinc, the solids are first drawn in absoluteresist ink, and, after covering the plate with semiresist varnish, it is etched in dilute nitric acid so that the solids are left in relief. After being washed and dried, the nearest solid parts are painted with the absolute resist, semi-resist varnish again applied, and the etching repeated. This process is repeated until the lightest tones have been produced. The plate may also be prepared by a photographic process. A gelatine film on the plate is exposed under the negative just long enough to transfer the solids, when the soluble gelatine is dissolved and washed off, and the plate etched, the same process being repeated for all the successive tones. To get heavier tones, the plate may be painted at the required parts with a varnish or the like, such as gold size containing a little colouring-matter. A separate make-ready is prepared for each colour to be printed. The makeready is attached resiliently to the impression surface. The impression cylinder a has a suitable blanket b secured to one end of a sheet of flexible cardboard c, the other end of which is glued to a strip of stiff linen d, having elastic loops e attached to hooks on the cylinder axle. Cardboard layers c', c"" are then used to build up the surface. To prepare the make-readies, the plate is covered with the first colour to be printed, an impression taken on the make-ready, and the parts not required to be printed in this colour cut out or removed by the operator so as not to print at these parts. Where the colour is to be lighter, the make-ready is slightly depressed. By repeating the process with the other colours, separate make-readies for each colour are obtained, but, when light and dark colours of a similar nature are to be printed, one make-ready can be used for them, the light colour being first printed, and then the parts not to be in the dark colour removed, so that they do not print in the succeeding impression. In preparing each makeready, it is preferred to take a pull or impression of the whole plate on a sheet of paper right over an impression of the colour or colours so far completed, so that the operator may see which parts are to be removed.",HILDYARD GEORGE RICHARD,HILDYARD GEORGE RICHARD,,https://lens.org/167-117-924-948-826,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   A compact and versatile device designed to aid the safe lifting and carrying (in an upright position) of large and awkward man-made sheet materials used in the construction industry, so developed to reduce the hazardous and tiring act of bending the back or legs in order to lift heavy sheet materials in common use. The tool is made of strong and durable materials, whilst remaining small enough to be carried easily on the person, so remaining ready for immediate use and consequently more likely to be used than some other, sometimes complicated, devices already on the market. The device consists of a strong carrying shoe suitable to support the lower edge of the sheet material, with a loop of strong but flexible webbing strap which is secured through a purpose-made slot in the carrying shoe. This strap, when wrapped around the operatives hand or wrist, forms an easy means by which a board may then be lifted clear of the ground, and carried away to another place.

PINCHIN, JOHNSON & ASSOCIATES Ltd. 26 Oct., 1966 [27 Oct., 1965], No. 45435/65. Heading C3B. A polymer is produced by condensing a glycidyl polyether of a dihydric phenol with a monobasic fatty acid and at least one anhydride chosen from maleic, phthalic, trimellitic and alkyl-succinic anhydrides or the corresponding acids, in proportions such that the product has an acid value of at least 20, this product then being neutralized. The preferred proportions are 0À2 to 0À4 equivalents of monobasic acid and 0À1 to 0À4 equivalents of the anhydride per equivalent of glycidyl compound. The reaction is preferably carried out in two stages, in which the monobasic acid is used first and the anhydride second. Suitable monobasic fatty acids contain at least 7 C atoms and are preferably drying oil acids; they include linseed and dehydrated castor oil fatty acids, linoleic, pelargonic, lauric and 12-hydroxystearic acids; rosin may also be used. Other polycarboxylic acids may replace part of those named above, e.g. long-chain dicarboxylic acids and dimeric and tricarboxylic fatty acid derivatives. Suitable epoxy compounds are the glycidyl polyethers of bisphenol A, hydroquinone and resorcinol. Suitable neutralizing agents are NaOH and NH 3 and Et 2 NH, Et 3 N, mono-, di-, and triethanolamine, morpholine, dimethylaminoethanol, diethylaminoethanol, and isopropanolamine. The products may be dissolved in water which may contain, e.g., butanol, isobutanol, the monoethyl or monobutyl ethers of ethylene or diethylene glycol, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, isophorone, cyclohexanone or petroleum distillates. In Examples epoxy resins are reacted in xylene with dehydrated castor oil fatty acids plus rosin, or with lauric acid, pelargonic acid or stearic acid, then with maleic anhydride, phthalic anhydride plus a maleinized fatty acid, or trimellitic anhydride or dodecenylsuccinic anhydride; the products are neutralized with diethylamine, triethylamine or NaOH, with or without previous addition of ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, then diluted with water.",PINCHIN JOHNSON & ASS LTD,HAYWARD GEORGE RICHARD,,https://lens.org/015-019-004-680-854,Granted Patent,no,0,0,5,6,0,C07C7/152;;C08G59/4292;;C08G59/4292;;C07C7/152,C07C7/152;;C08G59/42,C3B BF            BF;;C3B BN            BN;;C3B B1C12         -;;C3B B1C12         BN;;C3B B1C16         -;;C3B B1C16         BN;;C3B B1C25         -;;C3B B1C25         BN;;C3B B1C9A         -;;C3B B1C9A         BN;;C3B B1D2C         BF;;C3B B1D2C         BN;;C3B B1L2X         -;;C3B B1L2X         BN;;C3B B1L6G         -;;C3B B1L6G         BN;;C3B B1N3          BF;;C3B B1N4A         BF;;C3B B1N4B         BF;;C3B B1N4C         BF;;C3B B1N4F         BF;;C3B B1N4H         BF;;C3B B1N4J         BF;;C3B B1N4X         BF;;C3B B1N5A         BF;;C3B B1N6D2        BF;;C3B B1N6D3        BF;;C3B B1N6D4        BF;;C3B B1N6D7        BF;;C7B B10B          -;;C7B B16A          -;;C7C CA165;;C7C CA228;;C7C CA229;;C7C CA248;;C7C CA250;;C7C CA253;;C7C CA26X;;C7C CA268;;C7C CA291;;C7C CA33Y;;C7C CA382;;C7C CA383;;C7C CA384;;C7C CA385;;C7C CA395;;C7C CA398;;C7C CA399;;C7C CA406;;C7C CA407;;C7C CA408;;C7C CA423;;C7C CA43X;;C7C CA433;;C7C CA439;;C7C CA44Y;;C7C CA445;;C7C CA450;;C7C CA452;;C7C CA456;;C7C CA459;;C7C CA46X;;C7C CA46Y;;C7C CA460;;C7C CA461;;C7C CA472;;C7C CA52X;;C7C CA520;;C7C CA521;;C7C CA526;;C7C CA53X;;C7C CA530;;C7C CA534;;C7C CA535;;C7C CA536;;C7C CA538;;C7C CA539;;C7C CA54X;;C7C CA54Y;;C7C CA628;;C7C CB318;;C7C CC68Y;;C7C CC695;;C7C CC696;;C7C CC715;;C7C CC724;;C7C CC730;;C7C CC738;;C7C CC749;;C7C CC762,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Sept. 14. Brakes.-Relates to means for shutting off steam or applying the brakes of a railway train, when it passes a 'danger' signal. A curved bar q is pivoted at one end to a sleeper s, and is connected by the rod q<2> &c. to the ordinary signaloperating mechanism, so that, when the signal is at danger,' the bar is parallel to the rails, while, when the signal is put to 'safety,' the bar is rotated into an inoperative position. In the former position, the bar is adapted to raise the sliding bar b, Fig. 2, on the engine, and so release the catch e from the weight w, which, in falling, acts through the connections g, r and the lever l, to close the regulator m. Instead of, or in addition to, closing the regulator, the apparatus may be arranged to apply the brakes. For engines which are also run tender foremost, the apparatus is duplicated, as shown at g<1>, l<2>. In the form shown in Fig. 3, the bar b is connected by the link j<3> to a bracket. Further modifications are described, in which the sliding bar and catch are replaced by a lever adapted to be deflected by the bar q to release the weight w",KITTRIDGE GEORGE RICHARD,KITTRIDGE GEORGE RICHARD,,https://lens.org/121-547-990-333-900,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Sept. 19, 1962 [Sept. 27, 1961], No. 34620/61. Heading G4M. In a punched - card reader, a first contact block 19 is fixed relative to a frame 4 and a second contact block 20 is fixed to a pair of posts 17, 18 which are slidable through block 19. In operation, a card 34 is sensed by moving handle 6 in an anticlockwise direction whereupon a lever 40 coupled to shaft 5 moves rod 38 to the left, this in turn rotating link 36 which allows card guide 33 to descend and thus draw card 34 into the reading position. Further movement of handle 6 moves block 20 nearer to block 19. An apertured plate 24, which is slidable relative to block 20 by means of spring - loaded bolts 26, first comes into contact with the card 34, and then spring-loaded pins 23 are urged against the card or through the perforations therein to make contact with the pins of block 19. The card is removed by rotating handle 6 in the opposite direction. When card 34 is in the correct reading position lever 40 is disengaged from shaft 5 by means of a spring- loaded catch 42. The extent of movement of block 20 relative to block 19 is limited by a cam 45 which co-operates with a stop 46.",ROTAX LTD,WHITTLE RICHARD GEORGE,,https://lens.org/140-216-680-331-742,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,2,0,,,G4M MBA           MBA;;G4M MB5A          -;;G4M MB5Y          MB5;;G4M MC1           -;;G4M MC3           -;;G4M MK1           -;;G4M MK5           -;;G4M ML2           -;;G4M ML5           -;;G4M MN6           -;;G4M MQ4           -;;G4M MR4           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

For example, a PBX can communicate using SIP signaling to a gateway to a PSTN network, to which a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) is coupled, and which a mobile device, uses for voice communication. Controlling or updating status in these kinds of situations can be accomplished by forming a Q.931/932 message, such as a FACILITY message, which has fields (Information Elements) for pre-defined purposes (other than third party call control), and providing control or status information in such field(s). The message (the info) is tunneled through the gateway and the network(s), and arrives at its destination device.

Carrier gas such as hydrogen enters the chamber (12) via the port (14) and the output gas, which also includes vapour from the solid reactant material (18), exits the chamber via the dip tube (16). This is the reverse flow direction to that employed in conventional bubblers and leads to a more stable output. To prevent the entrainment of solid particles the dip tube may be of a wide bore dimension and/or a filter (20) may be incorporated therein. The bubbler is immersed in a constant temperature water bath and the bath temperature determines the vapour pressure of the solid reactant source. In use with hydrogen as the carrier gas and trimethylindium (TMIn) as the solid reactant source the hydrogen concentrates at the top of the chamber since it is less dense than the H2 - TMIn mixture formed as a saturated mixture in equilibrium with solid TMIn and will begin to force the H2 - TMIn downwards. <IMAGE>",STC PLC,ANTELL GEORGE RICHARD,,https://lens.org/046-447-061-985-078,Patent Application,no,10,21,3,3,0,C30B25/14;;C23C16/4481,C23C16/448;;C30B25/14,A5G GF            GF;;C7F FHE           FHE;;C7F FR919         FHE,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

SOLUTION: A light absorbance-measuring apparatus 10 for measuring, e.g. a plurality of fused silica prisms 16 have a temperature sensor 16 of a resistance temperature detector type which is arranged in touch with each prism 14 and a reference temperature sensor 18 measuring a temperature in the neighborhood of each prism. A mother board 22 to which the sensors 16, 18 are mounted is surrounded by a housing of an aluminum base 26 or the like. Cooling effect by a convection is decreased by the housing. A light beam 32 from a light beam source 33 such as a laser or the like passes each prism 14, is reflected at a mirror 34 and returned with using each prism 14 as a double path. The light beam 32 is absorbed at the interior or a front face of each prism 14, thereby raising a temperature of the prism 14. A temperature rise measured by the sensors 16, 18 is directly proportional to a total absorbance at the front face and interior of the prism 14.",CYMER INC,MORTON RICHARD GEORGE,,https://lens.org/083-344-061-567-028,Patent Application,no,0,0,8,8,0,G01N21/171;;G01N21/171,G01M11/02;;G01N21/17;;G01N21/88;;G01N21/958,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

This disclosure adds further novel and inventive developments to the cyclonic device which enable it to be used as a separating device for systems involving all three phases (gas, liquid and solid) and where two, three or more different product streams may be separated, all within the same cylindrical profile. These further inventive developments also relate to the use of externally supplied gas and / or additional liquid phases which are injected through the walls of the cyclonic body using specifically located slots and / or holes in combination with specifically located stepped edges. These further novel and inventive developments enable the concepts of froth floatation (FF) and Dispersed Air Floatation (DAF) to be exploited within an enhanced gravitational field together with the options for washing the separated froth and / or the separated heavier fractions, all within the same cyclonic unit. As part of the novel and inventive introduction of the stepped edges, means are provided whereby gas bubbles smaller than 30 microns can be created on a large scale and with a reduced energy input relative to typical conventional equipment. Also, the size of the gas bubbles may be controlled together with the intensity of any particle on particle interactions that may be created. This latter has many potential applications within FF and / or DAF processes, including applications within oil and tar separation from solid surfaces and within many ore preparation and ore leaching processes.

These further inventive developments also relate to the use of externally supplied gas and / or additional liquid phases which are injected through the walls of the cyclonic body using specifically located slots and / or holes in combination with specifically located stepped edges. These further novel and inventive developments enable the concepts of froth floatation (FF) and Dispersed Air Floatation (DAF) to be exploited within an enhanced gravitational field together with the options for washing the separated froth and / or the separated heavier fractions, all within the same cyclonic unit. As part of the novel and inventive introduction of the stepped edges, means are provided whereby gas bubbles smaller than 30 microns can be created on a large scale and with a reduced energy input relative to typical conventional equipment. Also, the size of the gas bubbles may be controlled together with the intensity of any particle on particle interactions that may be created. This latter has many potential applications within FF and / or DAF processes, including applications within oil and tar separation from solid surfaces and within many ore preparation and ore leaching processes. The tubular profile enables processing and separation to be achieved ""within the pipe line"" or for very closely packed arrangements to be assembled within carrier vessels.",CYDAF TECHNOLOGIES LTD;;BRUNETTI URSULA ANTONELLA DAVEY,PAXTON RICHARD GEORGE,,https://lens.org/029-886-303-566-115,Patent Application,yes,18,4,14,14,0,B01D45/16;;B04C5/10;;B04C5/06;;B04C5/103;;B04C5/13;;B04C5/14;;B04C5/28;;B01D21/2411;;B01D21/267;;B03D1/1418;;B01D17/0217;;B01D19/0057;;B01D47/00;;B01D45/16;;B04C5/10;;B04C5/06;;B04C5/103;;B04C5/13;;B04C5/14;;B04C5/28;;B01D21/2411;;B01D21/267;;B03D1/1418;;B01D17/0217;;B01D19/0057;;B01F23/232,B01D45/16,,0,0,,,,PENDING
