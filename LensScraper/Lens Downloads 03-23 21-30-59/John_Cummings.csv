This configuration allows the wind to engage with the sail members on one side of the shaft to rotate the shaft, and blow past the sail members on the other side of the shaft. Rotation of the cylinder is thus achieved while wind resistance is greatly minimized, regardless of the wind direction. A generator can be rotatably intercoupled with the cylinder to thereby convert the kinetic energy of rotation to useable energy.

J., Cummings, H. G , Chamberlain, R., and White, A. B. Aug. 11. Sunken ships, raising.-Relates to means for passing a line under the hull of a submerged vessel to facilitate the fastening of the slings, the invention being particularly applicable for salving ships sunk in water too deep for the operation of divers. The stayed tube 2 having a curved end 6 is fitted with lower and upper clips 15, 21 from which tackles 9, 10 and 11, 12, 13 pass to anchors 14. The lower clip has an arm 20 free to turn in a vertical plane and connected by the tackle 8 to an anchor. Silt, mud, &c. under the hull of the submerged vessel is cleared by passing compressed air or other fluid through the tube 2, and the channel cut allows a line projected through the same tube to pass round the hull. Fig. 4 shows the line-projecting apparatus. A fine line, wound on the reel 24 mounted on the shaft 23 provided with a reversible handle, has its end 26 attached to a float placed inside the box 32 attached to the lower end of the piston-rod 33. Normally, the box 32 is held in the elevated position by compressed air acting on the underside of the piston 35. When this piston is forced down, the stop 43 trips the spring latch 44, Fig. 6, and the float is forced through the neck 25 and tube 2, and is delivered through the orifice 7, Fig. 1. Cables, and finally the slings, may be attached to the line and so taken under the hull.",CUMMINGS WILLIAM JOHN;;CUMMINGS HERBERT GEORGE;;CHAMBERLAIN ROBERT;;WHITE ARTHUR BERNARD,CUMMINGS WILLIAM JOHN;;CUMMINGS HERBERT GEORGE;;CHAMBERLAIN ROBERT;;WHITE ARTHUR BERNARD,,https://lens.org/049-125-734-439-82X,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Each push button has a carriage adapted to be fitted on one side with an optional leaf spring contactor engageable with fixed contact members. The opposite side of the carriage is fixedly fitted with a compressible silicone rubber or other resilient valve member in sealing engagement with a port plate to carry out vacuum valving functions. Each carriage is guided by a tongue-and-slot guiding arrangement, whereby sealing pressure is applied between the valve member and the port plate. Each carriage has a rearwardly projecting tongue, slidably received in a slot formed in flange structure on the port plate. The front portion of each push button is also slidably guided to maintain the sealing pressure. Each push button has its own coiled return spring, received and detained in a semicylindrical nest, offset laterally on the carriage and overlapping the valve member and the contactor, thus affording a highly compact construction. A delatching mechanism is provided, whereby depression of a single push button, or any of a plurality of push buttons, delatches all of the other push buttons, including one push button having a push-push latching action.

The comparator produces a control signal depending upon a comparison of the input power voltages, and the control signal activates one or more of the switches to allow current flow through an appropriate path in the circuit to yield the constant polarity across the electrical load. Thus, the circuit can protect the electrical load from an inappropriately applied voltage by switching the applied voltage's polarity.

Bypass resistors coupled to the switches allow the electronic device to receive a small current (""pre-charge"") before any of the switches are activated so that a comparator can test for the presence of various types of short circuits. Additionally, the precharging brings the electronic device to a higher voltage (as compared to no pre-charging) when one of the switches is activated, thereby helping to reduce in-rush currents. Blanking logic allows the protection circuit to tolerate certain in-rush currents by preventing the latch from triggering (e.g., supplying the latch with an under-current signal) for an appropriate time period.",DELL USA LP,KATES BARRY K;;CUMMINGS JOHN A,DELL U.S.A.

This increase in dissociated ion concentration is directly proportional to the original concentration of urea in the biological sample; and any one of the several conventional electrical measurements may be made to determine the increase in such concentration or the rate of increase in such concentration and thereby determine the concentration of urea in the original biological sample. The buffered carrier solution containing the products of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is reclaimed by circulating it through a deionization, purification stage in which the solution conductivity is substantially returned to the prereaction value. The carrier solution is recirculated and used for processing additional samples. The enzyme, urease, is immobilized in a manner which allows many tests to be run without any significant loss thereof.

A particular mode may be selected at any given time so as to strike an appropriate balance between signal quality and power consumption with respect to a particular terminator or set of terminators. This prevents excessive power consumption due to terminator circuitry at inactive or infrequently active IC pins.,IBM,DREPS DANIEL MARK;;SCHIFF JOHN CUMMINGS,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (2003-06-02),https://lens.org/066-265-239-440-189,Granted Patent,yes,2,11,2,2,0,H04L25/0298;;H04L25/0298,H03K17/16;;H03K19/003,326/30;;326/86,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A terminator circuit for use on a pin of an integrated circuit (IC) is disclosed. A preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a clamp circuit that turns on when the voltage at the pin exceeds a threshold value (either an upper or lower bound). Logic and biasing circuitry are used to allow multiple modes of operation by adjusting the threshold values. A particular mode may be selected at any given time so as to strike an appropriate balance between signal quality and power consumption with respect to a particular terminator or set of terminators. This prevents excessive power consumption due to terminator circuitry at inactive or infrequently active IC pins.

April 21. Sawing stone.-Relates to a machine with reciprocating saws. The machine is shown in elevation, Fig. 1 being the driving-end and Fig. 1<a> the sawing- end. Its framework is built up of longitudinal and transverse beams and uprights. The saw frame G is suspended by frames N from brackets M which are adjustable in height on the guides K by feedscrews I<2>. These feed-screws are driven through bevel gearing on two parallel shafts Q, Q<1>, which are connected by the shaft g and bevel gearing. The shaft Q may be driven through spur gearing T and open and crossed belts E<12>, E<13> from the main shaft E<8>; or it may be driven through a ratchet-wheel t and pawl t<6> worked by a slotted lever t<4>, connecting-rod, and clank x<18> driven from the crank shaft B<7>. The ratchet feed is thrown out of gear by lowering the ratchet-wheel, which is mounted on the lever t<2> operated by the handrod t<8>. A belt shifter V is provided for the open and crossed belt feed. The saw frame is driven by crank shafts B', B' through an intermediate reciprocating frame X<2>, which is connected to the shafts by connecting-rods C<1>, D' and to the saw frame by a rod x<12>. This latter rod is kept on the level of the saw frame by a feed-screw in the intermediate frame X<2> driven by bevel gearing X from a feathered shaft W<5> which receives motion through bevel gearing and chain gearing W<2> from the shaft Q, which operates the feed of the saw frame. The crank shafts B', B<7> are geared together by a chain B<5>, and are driven from the main shaft E<8> by belting which is tightened by a pulley D<14> mounted on a hand-operated rack frame D<9>.",CUMMINGS HARRY HARRISON;;COOLEY JOHN DOMINICK,CUMMINGS HARRY HARRISON;;COOLEY JOHN DOMINICK,,https://lens.org/065-854-029-723-083,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

    Piercing, heat sink, and reflector modules are detachably connected together to provide a lighting fixture adaptable to low voltage, line voltage, halogen, fluorescent, incandescent, and other lighting systems. In heat sensitive applications, such as insulated ceilings, a heat conductive basket sleeve is disposed around the heat sink and reflector modules, and the sleeve, heat sink module and reflector module are enclosed within a heat-sealing cover. Heat from the sleeve is conducted to a trim ring externally disposed on the lighting fixture. The lighting fixture permits direct connection to a continuous insulated cable without the requirement of a junction box connection, thereby facilitating installation of the fixture in either new or existing construction.

METAL BOX CO. Ltd. March 7, 1961 [April 29, 1960], No. 15214/60. Class 78 (1). Cans 2 moving along a conveyer 1 engage and thereby rotate a plate 5 which carries a series of electromagnets 9. If the latter are energized, the can in engagement with the plate 5 will be caused to adhere to it and will be deflected into a reject path 22. The energization of the magnets 9 may be initiated from a sensing head 18 which may be arranged to detect the presence of the metal bottom of a can, or alternatively the absence of the same. In a modification (Fig. 4, not shown) the sensing head is adapted to transmit a signal in respect of every can passing on the conveyer. A device is then included in the circuitry which causes only alternate signals from the head 18 to be transmitted to the contacts 9. Thus alternate cans pass into the path 22 while remaining cans continue on the conveyer 1. The electromagnets 9 are connected electrically to energizing amplifiers 20, 21, by means of a commutator 10 (shown apart from the plate 5 in Fig. 1 for clearness). Two sets of contacts 11, 12 are provided on the commutator 10 so that two successive electromagnets 9 may be energized in overlapping relation (for example when two successive cans are to be removed from the conveyer). Synchronizing contacts 16 are also carried by the commutator 10.

    In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, a communication system (  17  ) is provided for generating and monitoring data over pre-existing conductors (  2  A-  2  D) between associated pieces of networked computer equipment (  3  A-  3  D). The system includes a communication device (  12  ) attached to the electronic equipment that transmits information to a central module (  15  ) by impressing a low frequency signal on the pre-existing data lines of the remotely located equipment. A receiver (  6  ) in the central module (  15  ) monitors the low frequency data on the data lines to determine the transmitted information of the electronic equipment. The communication device may also be powered by a low current power signal from the central module (  15  ). The power signal to the communication device may also be fluctuated to provide useful information, such as status information, to the communication device. Relocation of the electronic equipment with attached communication device to another location on the network is detected immediately and may be used to update a database. This invention is particularly adapted to be used with an existing Ethernet communications link or equivalents thereof.

    In a transfer linearization (TL) circuit one or more biased nonlinear elements form a nonlinear attenuator and a biased network to allow adjustment of diodes to linearize the overall transfer of the TL circuit and an amplifier being linearized. The transfer linearization circuit reduces distortion encountered in a broadband RF amplifier. The circuit compensates for attenuation of amplified broadband signals in CATV systems. The transfer linearization circuit provides low insertion loss and requires very low power consumption. Nearly constant impedance and constant insertion loss is provided across a wide frequency range and reduces both in-band and out-of-band third order distortions. The TL circuit exhibits instantaneous amplitude and phase transfer correction. No tuned frequency selective components are required so that adjustments are relatively straightforward.

Instead of obtaining the IP address from a location register of the IP PBX, the method involves use of a server configured to assign and provide to the caller's communication device a unique address (IP address/port) of a proxy. The caller then sends a Short Message Service (SMS) text message to the callee with the assigned address of the proxy. Thereafter, the caller and the callee connect at the assigned address of the proxy, thereby forming a communication path. Preferably, the devices operated by the parties are conventional smart phones. According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the method further comprises the steps of: determining whether to encrypt the communication; and encrypting the communication, if it is determined that the communication is to be encrypted. Preferably, the Station-to-Station (STS) protocol is used to encrypt the data packets.",PATEL DIPEN T;;CURTIS JOHN;;JONES JAMES C;;CUMMINGS DARREN;;SAIFE TECHNOLOGIES INC,PATEL DIPEN T;;CURTIS JOHN;;JONES JAMES C;;CUMMINGS DARREN,SAIFE INC (2014-08-07),https://lens.org/034-095-438-910-278,Granted Patent,yes,5,0,8,8,0,H04L65/1053;;H04L65/1069;;H04L63/0442;;H04L63/062;;H04L63/101;;H04L9/0841;;H04L63/0428;;H04W12/0431;;H04W12/082;;H04L65/1053;;H04L65/1069;;H04L63/0442;;H04L63/101;;H04L9/0841;;H04L63/062;;H04W12/082;;H04W12/0431;;H04L63/0428;;H04L9/321;;H04W12/04;;G06F12/1408;;H04L9/14;;H04L63/061;;H04L2209/24;;H04L9/3252,G06F9/00;;H04M1/66;;H04L29/06,455/411;;713/153;;713/165;;726/12,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Instead of obtaining the IP address from a location register of the IP PBX, the method involves use of a server configured to assign and provide to the caller's communication device a unique address (IP address/port) of a proxy. The caller then sends a Short Message Service (SMS) text message to the callee with the assigned address of the proxy. Thereafter, the caller and the callee connect at the assigned address of the proxy, thereby forming a communication path. Preferably, the devices operated by the parties are conventional smart phones. According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the method further comprises the steps of: determining whether to encrypt the communication; and encrypting the communication, if it is determined that the communication is to be encrypted.

In particular, a WCD is served by a first wireless coverage area of a RAN, and is conducting a media session using a first codec. The WCD detects that it is about to be handed off to a second wireless coverage area, and transmits a request to a server to determine the capacity available to the WCD via the second wireless coverage area. If this capacity is less than the capacity request by the first codec, the WCD proactively renegotiates the media session to use a second codec that requires less capacity. The server may take various factors into account when responding to the WCD's query, including the sector loading of the second wireless coverage area, available capacity at a backhaul link between the RAN and a network, and/or a profile of the WCD.",MAUER BRIAN D;;ZAMORA PEDRO;;LYNCH JOHN D;;CUMMINGS LARRY D;;SPRINT SPECTRUM LP,MAUER BRIAN D;;ZAMORA PEDRO;;LYNCH JOHN D;;CUMMINGS LARRY D,SPRINT SPECTRUM LLC (2009-02-17),https://lens.org/031-991-219-270-027,Granted Patent,yes,107,27,1,1,0,H04W36/00835;;H04W36/00835,H04W36/00,455/436,39,3,038-584-489-737-332;;047-728-959-158-850;;007-109-755-061-359,10.1109/pimrc.2007.4394055;;10.1145/1409944.1409969;;10.1587/elex.6.389,"R.
