The restoring force of the support structure works in concert with frictional coupling between the array and the spinal cord to overcome the inertial force associated with ateral motion of the array. The electrode array is supported with struts that run longitudinally across or near the array backing. For example, two struts can be affixed on either out-board longitudinal edge of the array. The electrode array can be further stabilized by securing to a vertebra in the patient using a strap equipped with a collar that encircles the bundle of electrical leads emerging from the array through the dura.

The device has an electrode assembly with a sufficiently thin profile to be implanted between the pial surface of the spinal cord and the dura mater, and secured to the dura. Electrodes on the electrode assembly are directed towards the surface of the spinal cord, and connected through the dura to a signal generator located outside the dura. Following implantation, the subject is treated by transmitting electrical signals from the signal generator through the leads to the electrodes, stimulating the subject's spinal cord.",UNIV IOWA RES FOUND;;UNIV VIRGINIA PATENT FOUNDATION;;UNIVERSTY OF IOWA RES FOUNDATION,HOWARD MATTHEW A;;BRENNAN TIMOTHY;;DALM BRIAN;;UTZ MARCEL;;GILLIES GEORGE T;;SCOTT STEVEN;;NELSON RANDALL S;;SHURIG ROBERT,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA (2012-04-30);;UNIVERSITY OF IOWA RESEARCH FOUNDATION (2013-12-18);;EVERGREEN MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES INC (2013-12-17),https://lens.org/146-388-587-768-623,Patent Application,yes,0,0,7,50,0,F04C2270/0421;;A61N1/0553;;A61N1/36171;;A61N1/36071;;A61N1/0558;;A61N1/0553;;A61N1/0556;;A61N1/36171;;A61N1/36071;;A61N1/0558;;F04C2270/0421;;A61N1/37518;;A61N1/36062;;A61N1/0551,A61N1/05;;A61N1/36,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
