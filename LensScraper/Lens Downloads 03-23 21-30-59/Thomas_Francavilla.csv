The substrate is heated to a temperature of 600.degree.-1200.degree. C., ultra-pure Argon is introduced into the chamber, and niobium is presputtered from a high-purity target onto a shutter. A cyanogen and nitrogen gas mixture is introduced into the chamber at a rate of approximately 10.sup.-6 Torr liters/sec, and a shutter is opened exposing the substrate to the sputtered niobium.

Cloud radar data from each unit are periodically measured and stored and made available to researchers, upon request, through the Internet or other network. The system comprises two computers operating on different operating systems. A first computer uses a first operating system which allows it to readily interface with various radar equipment using an IEEE 488 interface or the like, to monitor the health of the equipment and operate the equipment. A second computer system uses a second operating system in a multi-user mode which allows it to readily access and manipulate data files and transfer data over the network. Communication between the two computers is achieved by allowing the first computer to log into the second computer as one of the multiple users. The first computer may upload data to the second computer using a FTP protocol or the like. A second user in the second computer may generate cloud radar images and apply calibration data to received data to produce calibrated data. A third user may be logged onto the second computer to handle data transfers to and from the network. By using two computers with operating systems selected for optimum performance with their respective tasks, the system of the present invention allows for completely autonomous operation of a remote radar site with automated collection and distribution of cloud radar data.",US COMMERCE,WELSH DAVID C;;MERRITT DAVID A;;FRANCAVILLA ANTHONY J;;GLAESS THOMAS;;KING SANDY L;;ZHANG LINGLING;;MORAN KENNETH,UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AS REPRESENTED BY SECRETARY OF COMMERCE (1998-11-09);;UNIVERSITY TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION (1999-09-22),https://lens.org/015-902-611-030-848,Granted Patent,yes,13,17,1,1,0,G01S7/003;;G01S13/95;;Y02A90/10;;G01S13/95;;G01S7/003;;Y02A90/10,G01S7/00;;G01S13/95,702/3,1,0,,,"Moran, K.
