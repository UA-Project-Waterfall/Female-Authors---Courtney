IMPERIAL CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES Ltd. 24 June, 1968 [10 July, 1967], No. 31670/67. Addition to 1,135,979. Heading C2C. Primary or secondary alcohols are prepared by catalytic reduction of aldehydes or ketones, by contacting with hydrogen in the presence of a carboxylic acid containing at least two carbon atoms and a catalytic iridium complex of formula IrHY(OOC.R)L n wherein n is 2 or 3; Y is an anionic element or group, or hydrogen; R is an alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkaryl, aralkyl, alkenyl, cyclo - alkenyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, or heterocyclic group; and L is a ligand, both L groups being Z[R 1 R 2 R 3 ] when n is 2, and at least two L groups being Z[R 1 R 2 R 3 ] when n is 3, the remaining L group being CO or Z[R 1 R 2 R 3 ], the groups Z[R 1 R 2 R 3 ] being the same or different and Z being phosphorus, antimony or arsenic and R 1 , R 2 and R 3 being as for R above. Y and the group (OOC.R) are preferably each C 1 -C 6 alkyl mono-carboxylate groups, or Y may alternatively be halogen or -CN. R 1 , R 2 and R 3 may be C 1 -C 12 alkyl, phenyl, benzyl or pyridyl groups. The hydrogenation is carried out at room temperature and pressure or above, using 10<SP>-4</SP> to 10-1 molar amounts of the iridium complex. In an example, n-butyraldehyde is hydrogenated in acetic acid to a mixture of n - butanol and n - butyl acetate. A mixture of the iridium complexes IrH(OOC. - CH 3 ) 2 (P.Ph 3 ) 3 and IrH 2 (OOC.CH 3 )(P.Ph. 3 ) 3 is prepared by dissolving IrH 3 (P.Ph 3 ) 3 in acetic acid and distilling off the acetic acid under reduced pressure. A similar mixture is obtained by refluxing IrH 3 (P.Ph 3 ) 3 in acetic acid. Other complexes described are IrH 2 (OOC.CH 3 )(P.- Ph 3 ) 2 CO and IrH 2 (OOC.C 2 H 5 )(AsPh 3 ) 2 .",ICI LTD,COFFEY ROBERT STEVENSON,,https://lens.org/045-457-812-059-570,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,B01J31/1895;;B01J31/20;;B01J31/2226;;B01J31/2404;;B01J2231/643;;B01J2531/827;;C07C29/145;;C07C29/141,B01J31/16;;B01J31/18;;B01J31/22;;B01J31/24;;C07C29/141;;C07C29/145,C2C CCE;;C2C CYK;;C2C C20Y;;C2C C20Y;;C2C C231;;C2C C240;;C2C C26X;;C2C C261;;C2C C262;;C2C C30Y;;C2C C30Y;;C2C C36Y;;C2C C360;;C2C C361;;C2C C366;;C2C C368;;C2C C37X;;C2C C419;;C2C C491;;C2C C50Y;;C2C C507;;C2C C509;;C2C C569;;C2C C623;;C2C C628;;C2C C65Y;;C2P P4            -;;C2P P5B           -;;C2P P7            -;;C2P P9            P4,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Such permanent deformation absorbs energy from accidents within the device in which energy would otherwise be transferred to a support surface and the surrounding environment.",BECKMAN INSTRUMENTS INC,COFFEY ROBERT G,BECKMAN INSTRUMENTS INC (1993-11-17),https://lens.org/050-390-137-866-391,Granted Patent,yes,9,8,5,5,0,B04B7/02;;B04B7/02;;F16F15/06;;F16F15/06;;F16F7/12;;F16F7/12,B04B7/02;;F16F7/12;;F16F15/06,248/603;;248/300;;248/675,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Furthermore, a voltage limiting device, such as a diode pair, is connected across the adjacent ends of each wire. A magnet is described that produces a field in excess of one tesla with about ten amperes of current and that will withstand a quench from operating conditions. Superconductor wires of about 0.004 in. in diameter are utilized.",CRYOMAGNETICS INC,COFFEY DAVID M;;MCGHEE ROBERT W;;COFFEY DAVID L,CRYOMAGNETICS INC (1987-02-20),https://lens.org/157-630-862-644-310,Granted Patent,yes,3,14,1,1,0,H01F6/008;;H01F6/06;;Y10T29/49014;;Y10T29/49014;;H01F6/06;;H01F6/008,H01F6/00;;H01F6/06,29/599;;X174 15S;;174/125.1,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Acetaldehyde is particularly suitable but higher straight and branched chain aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes may be used. The olefines may be aliphatic mono-olefines, those with an alkyl group or the 2-carbon atom being preferred, and may contain other functional groups, e.g. hydroxy, alkoxy, keto, carboxyl, esto, aryl and halide. Di-olefines, e.g. butadiene, may also be used and yield mono and/or di-oxides. As oxygen-containing gas, oxygen itself, mixtures of oxygen and nitrogen or oxygen with any suitable diluent, e.g. CO2 or the olefine to be oxidized, may be used. The reaction, which may be performed batchwise, semi-continuously or continuously in the presence or absence of a diluent, is preferably initiated by, for example, U.V. light, various peroxide compounds and/or inorganic or organic salts of variable valency metals. The material of construction of the apparatus is of importance, porcelain, glass, enamel, resins, aluminium, tin and, in particular, ""Staybright"" (Registered Trade Mark) metal being suitable, and the volume: surface area ratio thereof should be as large as possible.

The process is preferably carried out in an inert solvent. Example 2 describes the hydrogenation of octene-1, octene-2, vinyl cyclohexene, cyclohexene and di-isobutylene to fully saturated products, and of phenyl acetylene to a mixture of styrene and ethyl benzene.ALSO:The invention comprises rhodium complexes of formula Rh(X)R1R11R111Y)3, wherein Y is phosphorus, arsenic or antimony, X is an anionic element or group and R1, R11 and R111 are the same or different and are hydrocarbon, substituted hydrocarbon (such as alkoxyaryl) or heterocyclic groups. They may generally be prepared by reacting a monovalent rhodium complex containing replaceable neutral ligands with YR1R11R111. The monovalent rhodium complex may for example be RhX(Ph3P)-(cyclo-1,5-octadiene) or preferably is a complex of formula (RhXZ2)n in which Z represents a mono-olefine and n is 2; or Z represents an acyclic conjugated di-olefine and n is 1. The particular compounds RhX(Ph3P)3 may also be prepared from the rhodium salt of X, by heating the rhodium salt with at least a four-fold molar excess of triphenyl phosphine in a suitable solvent. X, in the compounds may, for example, be a cyanide, cyanate, carboxylate or SnCl3- group but is suitably a halogen. The examples describe the preparation of RhCl(Ph3P)3, RhBr(Ph3P)3, RhI(Ph3P)3, RhCl(Ph2EtP)3, RhCl[(P-C6H4Cl)3P]3, and RhCl(Ph3A5)3. The compounds (RhXZ2)n above, when Z is a mono-olefine and X is chlorine, may be prepared by reacting RhCl3 in an alcohol solution with the mono-olefine. (RhCl(cyclo-octene)2)2 may be prepared in this way. When Z is an acyclic conjugated diolefine, the compounds may be prepared by digesting [RhCl(cyclooctene)2]2 with the appropriate diolefine. The invention also comprises a hydrogenation process comprising contacting a compound containing one or more olefinic or acetylenic bonds, and hydrogen with a rhodium complex of the invention.

The cook or chef knows at a glance when the meat is cooked to the customer's order so as to avoid serving the meat when it is over- or under-cooked.

Suitable aldehydes are, for example, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, n-butyraldehyde and benzaldehyde. Suitable olefinic starting materials are, for example, aliphatic mono-olefines such as cis- and trans-butene-2,2,4,4-trimethyl-pentene-2, n-octene-2; cyclo mono-olefines such as cyclohexene; arylalkenes; open-chain and cyclic dienes and polyenes; and acids, alcohols, ketones and esters containing a carbon-carbon double bond which is in a non-terminal position. An inert diluent, for example acetone, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate or acetic acid or the acid that is being produced, may be present. The process is advantageously carried out in the presence of one or more organic or inorganic salts of metals of variable valency, e.g. copper, manganese, nickel or cobalt, and/or an imitator which is able to yield free radicals during the course of the reaction such as hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides, dialkylperoxides, diacylperoxides, dialkylperoxy dicarbonates, peroxy esters and azo compounds. The process may also be carried out under the influence of ultra-violet light. Examples are given of the conversion of a mixture of (a) 2,4,4-trimethyl-pentene-2 and n-butyraldehyde to 2,3-epoxy-2,4,4-trimethyl pentene and butyric acid; (b) cis-butene-2 and acetaldehyde to cis- and trans-2,3-epoxybutane and acetic acid; (c) trans-butene-2 and acetaldehyde to cis- and trans-2,3-epoxybutane and acetic acid and (d) cis- and trans-octene-2 and benzaldehyde to epoxyoctanes and acids.",ICI LTD,COFFEY ROBERT STEVENSON;;LAWLEY HERBERT GEORGE,,https://lens.org/178-555-340-046-932,Granted Patent,no,0,2,4,5,0,C07D303/04;;C07D303/04;;C07C51/235;;C07C51/235;;C07C51/255;;C07C51/255;;C07D301/06;;C07D301/06;;Y10S204/903;;Y10S204/903;;Y10S204/905;;Y10S204/905;;Y10S204/909;;Y10S204/909;;Y10S204/911;;Y10S204/911;;Y10S204/912;;Y10S204/912;;Y10S204/913;;Y10S204/913,C07C51/235;;C07C51/255;;C07D301/06;;C07D303/04,C2C CBQ;;C2C CCQ;;C2C CZA;;C2C CZA;;C2C C1300;;C2C C20Y;;C2C C215;;C2C C215;;C2C C216;;C2C C216;;C2C C22Y;;C2C C220;;C2C C227;;C2C C24Y;;C2C C246;;C2C C246;;C2C C247;;C2C C247;;C2C C25Y;;C2C C253;;C2C C253;;C2C C265;;C2C C265;;C2C C266;;C2C C294;;C2C C294;;C2C C30Y;;C2C C30Y;;C2C C30Y;;C2C C30Y;;C2C C304;;C2C C304;;C2C C305;;C2C C366;;C2C C366;;C2C C367;;C2C C367;;C2C C37X;;C2C C37X;;C2C C409;;C2C C409;;C2C C410;;C2C C410;;C2C C43X;;C2C C43X;;C2C C458;;C2C C458;;C2C C46Y;;C2C C46Y;;C2C C490;;C2C C490;;C2C C628;;C2C C628;;C2C C65Y;;C2C C668;;C2C C69Y,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A magnetic recording system is provided having a write head employing a combination of magnetic write field gradient and thermal gradient to write data on a thermal spring magnetic recording media. The write head comprises a magnetic element using a write current to induce a magnetic write field at the magnetic media and a thermal element using a very small aperture laser to heat a portion of the media. The thermal spring magnetic media comprises comprises first and second stacks providing two exchange coupled ferromagnetic layers having different Curie temperatures. The first stack has a high magneto-crystalline anisotropy, a relatively low saturation magnetization and a low Curie temperature. The second stack has a relatively low magneto-crystalline anisotropy, a high saturation magnetization and a high Curie temperature. The magnetic field gradient and the thermal gradient are arranged to substantially overlap at the trailing edge of the heated portion of the magnetic media allowing data at high density with high thermal stability to be recorded on the rapidly cooling thermal spring magnetic recording media.

   A magnetic recording system is provided having a write head employing a combination of magnetic write field gradient and thermal gradient to write data on a thermal spring magnetic recording media. The write head comprises a magnetic element using a write current to induce a magnetic write field at the magnetic media and a thermal element using a very small aperture laser to heat a portion of the media. The thermal spring magnetic media comprises first and second stacks providing two exchange coupled ferromagnetic layers having different Curie temperatures. The first stack has a high magneto-crystalline anisotropy, a relatively low saturation magnetization and a low Curie temperature. The second stack has a relatively low magneto-crystalline anisotropy, a high saturation magnetization and a high Curie temperature. The magnetic field gradient and the thermal gradient are arranged to substantially overlap at the trailing edge of the heated portion of the magnetic media allowing data at high density with high thermal stability to be recorded on the rapidly cooling thermal spring magnetic recording media.

A bias layer (45) separated from the magnetoresistive sensing element by a spacer layer (43) provides a magnetic field to bias the magnetoresistive sensing element at a desired non-signal point. The ferromagnetic and the nonmagnetic materials are mutually immiscible, or may be miscible or partially miscible and processed in a manner to control interdiffusion. The magnetoresistive sensing element is formed by alternatively depositing layers of ferromagnetic material and layers of nonmagnetic conductive material on a substrate and then annealing the structure. During the annealing cycle, the layers of nonmagnetic material above and below the ferromagnetic layers penetrate at grain boundaries and break the continuity of the ferromagnetic layers to form layers or planes of ferromagnetic particles embedded in a matrix of nonmagnetic material.",IBM,COFFEY KEVIN ROBERT;;HOWARD JAMES KENT;;HYLTON TODD LANIER;;PARKER MICHAEL ANDREW,,https://lens.org/019-516-867-898-35X,Patent Application,yes,0,10,13,13,0,B82Y10/00;;B82Y25/00;;G01R33/093;;G11B5/3903;;G11B2005/3996;;H01F10/3227;;H10N50/85;;G11B5/39;;B82Y25/00;;H01F10/3227;;G11B5/3903;;G11B2005/3996;;B82Y10/00;;G01R33/093;;H10N50/85,G01R33/09;;G11B5/39;;H01F10/08;;H01F10/14;;H01F10/32;;H01L43/08;;H01L43/10,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A latch and release assembly is operatively associated with a riser support structure. The latch and release assembly engages with front and rear anchor members of the interior floor structure and releasably locks in one of a range of releasably locked positions. The latch and release assembly engages with the front and rear anchor members and is releasably locked in an initial one of the range of releasably locked positions. The removable vehicle seat assembly is moved downwardly towards the interior floor structure in response to an application of a downwardly directed force thereto when the latch and release assembly is releasably locked in the initial one of the range of releasably locked positions such that the yieldingly deformable material is yieldingly compressed to a decreased thickness. The latch and release assembly moves progressively from the initial one of the range of releasably locked positions to a subsequent one of the range of releasably locked positions corresponding to the decreased thickness of the yieldingly deformable material during downward movement of the removable vehicle seat assembly. The latch and release assembly is engaged with the front and rear anchor members and releasably locked in the subsequent one of the range of releasably locked positions to thereby prevent upward movement of the removable vehicle seat assembly away from the interior floor structure and to maintain the yieldingly deformable material at the aforesaid decreased thickness.,ATOMA INT INC;;MULTIMATIC INC,COFFEY ROBERT THOMAS;;PASCOE DAVID MARK;;GRUBER RUDOLPH;;STALEY BRIAN WILSON;;VANDOREN FOSTER,,https://lens.org/042-165-744-468-132,Patent Application,yes,7,6,13,13,0,B60N2/01583;;B60N2/01591;;B60N2/01583;;B60N2/01591,B60N2/015,,0,0,,,,PATENTED

A conductive layer is deposited over the array filling in the spaces separating the magnetoresistive elements to provide electrical conductivity between the elements in the plane of the structure. <IMAGE>",IBM,COFFEY KEVIN ROBERT;;FONTANA ROBERT EDWARD;;HOWARD JAMES KENT;;HYLTON TODD LANIER;;PARKER MICHAEL ANDREW;;TSANG CHING HWA,,https://lens.org/152-156-843-797-314,Granted Patent,no,0,0,19,19,0,B82Y10/00;;B82Y25/00;;G01R33/093;;G11B5/3903;;G11B2005/3996;;G11B5/39;;B82Y25/00;;G11B2005/3996;;B82Y10/00;;G11B5/3903;;G01R33/093;;H10N50/85,G01R33/09;;G11B5/39;;H01L43/10,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A latch and release assembly is operatively associated with a riser support structure. The latch and release assembly is configured to be engaged with front and rear anchor members of the interior floor structure and releasably locked in one of a range of releasably locked positions. The latch and release assembly is constructed to be engaged with the front and rear anchor members and releasably locked in an initial one of the range of releasably locked positions. The removable vehicle seat assembly is moved downwardly towards the interior floor structure in response to an application of a downwardly directed force thereto when the latch and release assembly is releasably locked in the initial one of the range of releasably locked positions such that the yieldingly deformable material is yieldingly compressed to a decreased thickness. The latch and release assembly moves progressively from the initial one of the range of releasably locked positions to a subsequent one of the range of releasably locked positions corresponding to the decreased thickness of the yieldingly deformable material during downward movement of the removable vehicle seat assembly. The latch and release assembly is engaged with the front and rear anchor members and releasably locked in the subsequent one of the range of releasably locked positions to thereby prevent upward movement of the removable vehicle seat assembly away from the interior floor structure and to maintain the yieldingly deformable material at the aforesaid decreased thickness.,MAGNA INTERIOR SYS INC;;ATOMA INT INC,COFFEY ROBERT T;;PASCOE DAVID M;;GRUBER RUFOLF;;STALEY BRIAN W;;VAN DOREN FOSTER,ATOMA INTERNATIONAL INC (1998-08-26);;MULTIMATIC INC (1997-08-02),https://lens.org/080-121-899-490-493,Granted Patent,yes,16,36,13,13,0,B60N2/01583;;B60N2/01591;;B60N2/01583;;B60N2/01591,B60N2/015,296/65.03;;296/65.01,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The magnetoresistive sensing element is formed by alternatively depositing layers of ferromagnetic material and layers of nonmagnetic material on a substrate and then patterning the resulting structure using photolithographic techniques to provide a planar array of magnetoresistive elements. A conductive layer is deposited over the array filling in the spaces separating the magnetoresistive elements to provide electrical conductivity between the elements in the plane of the structure. <IMAGE>",IBM,COFFEY KEVIN ROBERT;;FONTANA ROBERT EDWARD;;HOWARD JAMES KENT;;HYLTON TODD LANIER;;PARKER MICHAEL ANDREW;;TSANG CHING HWA,,https://lens.org/035-479-320-534-00X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,19,19,0,B82Y10/00;;B82Y25/00;;G01R33/093;;G11B5/3903;;G11B2005/3996;;G11B5/39;;B82Y25/00;;G11B2005/3996;;B82Y10/00;;G11B5/3903;;G01R33/093;;H10N50/85,G01R33/09;;G11B5/39;;H01L43/10,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The diluent injection system delivers required diluent-to-fuel ratios over the emissions compliance operating range of the gas turbine. The method for diluent injection is coupling the injection system to a gas turbine compressor discharge purge system, such that the diluent fluid is mixed with compressor discharge air. The mixed compressor discharge purge air and diluent stream are injected into the gas turbine combustor through a non-fueled combustion fuel nozzle passage to achieve emissions guarantee compliance.",GEN ELECTRIC,LAWSON WILLIAM JAMES;;RODRIGUEZ CARLOS ANDRES;;SLOBODYANSKIY ILYA ALEKSANDROVICH;;COFFEY DANIEL ROBERT;;BLAISDELL MICHAEL WAYNE,GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY (2010-04-12),https://lens.org/155-653-757-678-606,Patent Application,yes,10,18,4,4,0,F02C3/20;;F02C3/20;;F02C3/30;;F02C3/30;;F02C7/232;;F02C7/232;;F23L7/00;;F23L7/00;;F23R3/36;;F23R3/36;;F23R2900/00002;;F23R2900/00002,F02C3/30,60/775;;60/39.55,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The ideal conditions for preparing an amorphous vanadium oxide/noble metal thin film are identified. TCR and resistivity results showed that the additions of gold (Au) and platinum (Pt) into VO x reduced the resistivity. However, only gold (Au) was found to improve TCR value. Reducing the amount of oxygen in the thin film, further improved the ratio between TCR and resistivity.

The method is useful for evaluating cells from patients at risk for recurrence of prostate cancer following surgery for prostate cancer. Specifically, the method uses specific Markovian nuclear texture factors, alone or in combination with other biomarkers, to determine whether the cancer will progress or lose organ confinement. In addition, methods of predicting the development of fatal metastatic disease by statistical analysis of selected biomarkers is also disclosed. The invention also contemplates a method that uses a neural network to analyze and interpret cell morphology data. Utilizing Markovian factors and other biomarkers as parameters, the network is first trained with a sets of cell data from known progressors and known non-progressors.
