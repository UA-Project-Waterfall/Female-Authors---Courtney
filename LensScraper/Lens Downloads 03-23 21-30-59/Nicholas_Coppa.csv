A closed loop feedback controller causes the interaction of a shaped flaser pulse with a substrate. The substrate can be one or more solid, liquid or gas or any combination thereof. Nanoparticles are produced and their characteristics are measured. The measured characteristics are compared with the desired nanoparticle characteristics. If the measured and desired characteristics are not equivalent, the closed loop feedback controller modifies the shape of the laser pulse and the next cycle begins. With successive loop of the control process the difference between the desired and measured characteristics converges until they are equivalent. At the end of the process a relationship is developed between the desired nanoparticle characteristics and the laser pulse shape. A catalog of all pulse shapes generated and the resulting nanoparticle characteristics is generated each time the processor is cycled whether or not the nanoparticle characteristics are those desired.",COPPA NICHOLAS V;;LEVIS ROBERT J,COPPA NICHOLAS V;;LEVIS ROBERT J,,https://lens.org/000-780-418-633-113,Granted Patent,yes,4,21,1,1,0,B23K26/03;;B23K26/03;;B23K26/0624;;B23K26/0624;;B23K26/064;;B23K26/064;;B23K26/361;;B23K26/361;;B23K26/40;;B23K26/40;;B23K2101/04;;B23K2101/04;;B23K2103/10;;B23K2103/10;;B23K2103/50;;B23K2103/50;;B29B9/16;;B29B9/16;;B29B2009/125;;B29B2009/125,B29C35/08;;B29B9/00,264/5;;264/400;;264/406,13,13,008-992-078-113-618;;089-315-624-734-332;;032-391-629-249-199;;139-358-016-359-884;;102-707-711-999-402;;001-972-827-151-935;;076-752-281-658-73X;;024-988-393-547-174;;015-212-412-755-91X;;077-506-861-664-362;;064-550-398-462-705;;051-677-963-541-200;;081-392-459-681-158,10.1002/adma.200401126;;10.1016/s0169-4332(97)00651-x;;10.1016/s0021-8502(99)00067-1;;10.1351/pac200678122205;;10.1016/s0169-4332(97)00653-3;;10.1016/j.jaap.2007.11.009;;10.1016/j.apsusc.2008.07.207;;10.1063/1.3040082;;10.1007/s00339-008-4584-1;;10.1021/jp0134906;;10.1126/science.1059133;;11283357;;10.1039/b402246g;;10.1016/b978-012513760-7/50013-7,"J.

The solid is sublimated to vapor, and is condensed in a low temperature condenser 12 positioned upward a freeze drying chamber and coupled with the freeze drying chamber by a conduit 70. The low temperature condenser is prevented from being contaminated owing to matter such as radioactive material separated from the solution by vertically positioning the low temperature condenser with respect to a freeze dryer 1. The system is filled with inactive gas. Thereby, inactive gas flows powerfully downward toward the freeze drying chamber, and low temperature contamination due to such matter is further prevented.",BOC GROUP INC;;UNIV CALIFORNIA,COPPA NICHOLAS V;;STEWART PAUL;;RENZI ERNESTO,,https://lens.org/077-703-621-914-054,Patent Application,no,0,2,11,11,0,F26B5/06;;F26B5/06,G21F9/08;;F26B5/06;;G21F9/14,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
