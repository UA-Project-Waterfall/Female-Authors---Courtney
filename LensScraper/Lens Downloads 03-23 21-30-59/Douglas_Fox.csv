The invention relates to desalination apparatus which utilises solar energy and is thereby capable of continuously providing sufficient pure water for drinking, irrigation, etc. economically. A lagoon for seawater is heated by solar energy and the seawater is transferred to a vacuum boiler (30), steam being delivered through a turbine (54) to a condenser (22). The turbine (54) generates the power necessary for the running of the apparatus. Pure water is collected from the condenser (22) and the seawater remaining in the boiler (30) is returned to the lagoon through flexible tubes (14) arranged on a terraced support sloping down to the lagoon, the tubes (14) defining a collector for solar energy. The salinity balance in the seawater returned from the boiler (30) is maintained continuously by a flow circuit (44, 48) so arranged as to require no additional power consumption.",WATSON DEV LTD JOHN,SANDERS-FOX DOUGLAS,,https://lens.org/172-385-620-354-051,Patent Application,yes,9,2,3,6,0,C02F1/14;;Y02A20/124;;Y02A20/142;;Y02A20/211;;Y02A20/212,C02F1/14,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Each chamber F includes a sweeper wall 26 mounted in the rotor, and is bounded by inclined side walls 16 curved impact members 15, top wall segments 18, releasable covers 18 and a releasable bottom 12. The rotor compirses upper and lower discs 22, 23 bolted at 24 Fig. 3 and circumferentially-spaced impeller blades 25. The sweeper walls 26 are secured between the discs 22, 23 by bolts 27, Fig. 1, and may be resiliently mounted, e.g. on rubber. The casing has a central opening closed by a cover 28. The parts 16, 18, 26 may have ribbed or toothed surfaces. In operation, material enters the rotor from a box 29 via openings 30, is hurled by the blades 25 against the walls 15 and falls out via openings 31. The size of the product is determined by the speed of rotation of the rotor. Fan blades 32 draw in air via slots 33 and thus balance the internal pressures and prevent passage of excess dust across the parts. Entry of tramp metal causing an undesired out-of-balance effect may be used to operate an inertia switch stopping the apparatus and/or giving an alarm signal.

VICKERS - ARMSTRONGS (ENGINEERS), Ltd. Sept. 15, 1954 [Sept. 21, 1953], No. 25962/53. Classes 78 (1) and 78 (3). A vertically-movable platform used for transporting stacks of crates from floor to floor in a building is moved stepby-step near the upper floor in order that the crates in each layer of the stack on the platform can be manually moved horizontally on to a conveyer or from a conveyer to form a stack on the platform. At the lower floor the crates, which are stacked on pallets, are brought by fork-truck to the platform. As the truck approaches the platform it is constrained by guide rails 12 to pass over a contact device 13, depression of which causes the door 5 to open. The truck is moved on to deposit the pallet on the platform. On withdrawal of the truck the contact device 13 is released, the lift door closes and a red signal light 16 goes out. The attendant then starts the hoisting mechanism and the lift rises until the top layer of crates is slightly above the conveyer 7. This layer is removed by an attendant who, when the removal is complete, actuates a pedal switch 14 to energize a relay causing the lift to rise one step, i.e. through the height of a crate. These operations are repeated until the lift is empty. When an attendant at the other side of the structure 6 actuates a pedal switch, the lift is lowered one step. It is then loaded with a layer of crates and the operation completed until the stack is complete. The lift is then lowered to floor 1 on reaching which it causes a green signal light 16 to come on to indicate that the lift requires unloading.

[Also in Group XXIX] In, e.g., a rotary counter-pressure bottling machine, an automatic valve for admitting liquid to the tank 5, Fig. 1, comprises a pressure sensitive device such as a diaphragm 26 for operating a liquid admission valve 1, which responds to a pressure derived from a source of substantially constant pressure external to the tank and which is controlled by a valve device 44, Fig. 4, sensitive to liquid level in the tank. Liquid enters at 14 to the inlet of the valve 1 and passes a snift valve whereby gas in the liquid enters a chamber 13 and depresses an annular float 16 carrying a valve 15 so that the gas escapes via the valve a hollow central float guide 17 and a cock 20. The valve 15 is closed by the float as liquid re-enters the chamber 13. A source of pressure air is supplied at 29 past a pressure reducing valve 30 and a valve 31 to a valve chamber 32 which leads via a line 33 to a diaphragm chamber 27. The valve chamber contains a needle air-throttle valve 34 and an adjustable spring-loaded, leak-off valve 44 operated through a push rod 38 by twin floats 35 responsive to the liquid level in the tank, so that as the level falls due to the bottles being filled via pipes 11 and filling head 12, the leak-off valve closes and air pressure moves the spring loaded diaphragm to open the valve 1 and admit liquid to the tank via the inlet pipe 7 and annular conical opening 8.

The sweep start parameter is the value of input data applied to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) which would cause the DAC to produce an output voltage equal to the sweep signal starting level, and the sweep gain indicates the rate of increase in DAC input data required to produce a DAC output signal with a rate of increase similar to the slew rate of the sweep signal. The horizontal position of the point along the trace is the beam position on the screen at the moment the sweep signal magnitude reaches the magnitude of the DAC output signal. The delay time is computed as the difference between the DAC input data resulting in this DAC output signal magnitude and the sweep start parameter, the difference being divided by the sweep gain parameter.",TEKTRONIX INC,STEVENS DOUGLAS C;;FOX HENRY G,,https://lens.org/116-863-398-389-183,Granted Patent,no,0,0,5,5,0,G01R13/24;;G01R13/24,G01R13/24;;G01R13/30;;G01R29/00,375-35,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The sweep start parameter is the value of input data applied to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) which would cause the DAC to produce an output voltage equal to the sweep signal starting level, and the sweep gain indicates the rate of increase in DAC input data required to produce a DAC output signal with a rate of increase similar to the slew rate of the sweep signal. The horizontal position of the point along the trace is the beam position on the screen at the moment the sweep signal magnitude reaches the magnitude of the DAC output signal. The delay time is computed as the difference between the DAC input data resulting in this DAC output signal magnitude and the sweep start parameter, the difference being divided by the sweep gain parameter.

The primary objective of a high performance air filter is to provide maximum particle removal while maintaining an acceptable pressure drop. Conventional fibrous filters obtain improved particle removal efficiency by using filaments having small diameter, which can be packed closely together. This close packing results in smaller voids between the fibers, which increases the probability that particles will be intercepted by a fiber. This increase in particle removal is, however, accompanied by an increase in pressure drop. Excessive pressure drops can restrict air flow and shorten filter life. This invention provides filtration material comprising a web comprising continuous, meltblown fibers and staple, electrically charged fibers randomly dispersed among the continuous fibers. The filtration material can be formed in planar configurations and in configurations other than planar. Non-planar configurations can extend the useful working area for a given filter element's cross-section without requiring an additional corrugating or pleating process step. The filtration material exhibits high strength and low pressuredrop.",,SUNDET DOUGLAS C;;FOX ALBERT H,,https://lens.org/176-307-953-886-584,Granted Patent,no,0,0,15,15,0,B01D39/1623;;B01D39/2017;;B01D2239/10;;D04H1/42;;Y10S428/903;;Y10S55/39;;D04H1/56;;Y10T428/2495;;Y10T428/2904;;Y10T428/24612;;Y10T428/24686;;Y10T442/619;;D04H5/08;;D04H5/12;;Y10T428/2495;;Y10T428/2904;;Y10T428/24612;;Y10T428/24686;;Y10T442/619;;B01D39/2017;;B01D39/1623;;D04H1/42;;B01D2239/10;;Y10S428/903;;Y10S55/39;;D04H1/56,B01D39/14;;B01D39/16;;B01D39/20;;B03C3/28;;D04H1/42;;D04H1/56;;H05K7/20,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The pump modules have bladders which are operated by fluid, preferably gas, under pressure supplied through two separate internal passages in the modules to pump liquid upwardly through transfer modules. The pressure-operated valve is located below the bottom of the pump module and normally closes off the two gas passages. When gas under pressure above operating pressure is supplied through one of the passages, to establish a sufficient pressure differential between the passages, the valve opens to connect the passages. Heated gas can then be circulated to increase the temperature of internal oil passages extending through the modules to prevent paraffin formation. The two gas circuits can also be connected to enable removal of condensate.

The primary objective of a high performance air filter is to provide maximum particle removal while maintaining an acceptable pressure drop. Conventional fibrous filters obtain improved particle removal efficiency by using filaments having small diameter, which can be packed closely together. This close packing results in smaller voids between the fibers, which increases the probability that particles will be intercepted by a fiber. This increase in particle removal is, however, accompanied by an increase in pressure drop. Excessive pressure drops can restrict air flow and shorten filter life. This invention provides filtration material comprising a web comprising continuous, meltblown fibers and staple, electrically charged fibers randomly dispersed among the continuous fibers. The filtration material can be formed in planar configurations and in configurations other than planar. Non-planar configurations can extend the useful working area for a given filter element's cross-section without requiring an additional corrugating or pleating process step. The filtration material exhibits high strength and low pressure drop.",MINNESOTA MINING & MFG,SUNDET DOUGLAS C;;FOX ALBERT H,,https://lens.org/062-518-415-088-004,Patent Application,no,0,0,15,15,0,B01D39/1623;;B01D39/2017;;B01D2239/10;;D04H1/42;;Y10S428/903;;Y10S55/39;;D04H1/56;;Y10T428/2495;;Y10T428/2904;;Y10T428/24612;;Y10T428/24686;;Y10T442/619;;D04H5/08;;D04H5/12;;Y10T428/2495;;Y10T428/2904;;Y10T428/24612;;Y10T428/24686;;Y10T442/619;;B01D39/2017;;B01D39/1623;;D04H1/42;;B01D2239/10;;Y10S428/903;;Y10S55/39;;D04H1/56,B01D39/14;;B01D39/16;;B01D39/20;;B03C3/28;;D04H1/42;;D04H1/56;;H05K7/20,D10280002    M,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Bottling. VICKERS-ARMSTRONGS, Ltd. May 19, 1953 [June 16, 1952], No. 15128/52. Class 125 (2). In counterpressure rotating-table filling machines wherein each filling head includes a liquid valve 23 at the bottom of the filling tube 13 and a counterpressure valve 37 within the filling head casing 12, these valves being moved vertically in appropriate sequence through push rods 27, 38 by a tappet plate 31 rotated about a vertical axis by a star wheel 51 engaged by stationary stops around the machine, vertical movement of the plate 31 being effected by screw threads 48, each valve has a safety ball valve in series with it to close automatically upon a surge of liquid or counterpressure. Alternatively, the plate 31 may have its operative surface 30 formed as a face cam. The machine may be of the annular tank type. As shown, however, a pipe 7 leads liquid from a central reservoir to each head into which the liquid enters through a chamber 32, port 35 and chamber 11 communicating with the filling tube 13. A rush of liquid due to e.g. a burst bottle causes a phosphor bronze ball 33 to close the port 35. Closing of liquid valve 23 at the end of a cycle causes a collar 36 on stem 27 to knock the ball 33 out of seating 35. Counterpressure from a central water-column levelling vessel is transmitted through pipes 10 to a chamber 43 in each head. Thence, it passes through a port 42, a valve chamber 14 and conduits 15, 16 and 22 to the bottle. Valve 37 is at the lower end of chamber 42 and a ball 44 closes the port 42 in the event of a rush of gas. A shoulder 46 is so disposed on the rod 38 that the ball is knocked out of the port when the valve 37 is in its half open position or as it is moved from fully open to closed position. The valves are closed by springs 25, 41. In operation, the bottle is raised to engage member 20 which rises to cause gasket 18<SP>1</SP> to seat against gasket 17<SP>1</SP>. Star-wheel 51 is actuated to move valve 37 to half-open position to supply counterpressure. On further actuation of star-wheel 51, valve 37 is fully opened and the liquid valve 23 is also opened. The star-wheel is then, after filling, restored to its original position to allow the valves to close and the filled bottle is lowered.

Respiratory appliances. CAPE ENGINEERING CO Ltd and BYFIELD INVESTMENTS Ltd. Oct. 12, 1962 [Oct. 14, 1961], No. 36947/61. Heading A5T. A respiratory apparatus, which may be used for administering of anaesthetic or for forced breathing, has means for changing from automatic to manual operation or vice versa at will. The changeover is primarily effected by a selector valve assembly comprising three gauged valves 14, 13, 66 and, in the position shown oxygen or. other gas, received through flowmeters 2 or from an emergency supply 65, is fed into a duct 6 and any excess is accommodated in a bag 3. A positive pressure bellows, actuated by a shaft 81, forces it in the direction of the arrows 8 part a mechanically controlled valve 12 and connection 15 to the patient and subsequently, also actuated by the shaft 31, a valve 18 is opened and a second bellows 21 withdraws the gas from the patients lungs, through a carbon dioxide absorber 23 for recirculation, any excess in this case being accommodated in a bag 25. The timing of the breathing cycle is adjusted by a variable ratio gear-box 32 connected to the driving motor 30 and the volume passed at each cycle is adjusted by changing the position of the fulcrum of the lever 40 which extends between the bellows 9 and its actuating crank 37. When the selector valve assembly 66, 13, 14 is rotated anti-clockwise through 90 degrees a switch, not shown, stops the motor 30 and gas from inlet pipe 1 passes directly, through pipe 68, to the part of the circuit to the right of the valves 13, 14, which is now isolated from the rest of the equipment. In addition, a rebreathing bag 60 is connected through non-return valves to this effective part of the circuit so that by manually squeezing and releasing the bag 60 an operator can force gas into the patient's lungs, in the direction of the arrow 8, and withdraw it, through the carbon dioxide absorber 23, as indicated by the arrow 17. Spring loaded relief valves 28, 74, 75 are provided to prevent the building up of excessive pressures and a valve 20 limits the degree of suction which can be applied to the patient.",CAPE ENGINEERING COMPANY LTD;;BYFIELD INVESTMENTS LTD,FOX DOUGLAS ERIC RICHARD;;WAINE THEODORE EDWARD,,https://lens.org/135-336-119-995-274,Granted Patent,no,0,14,1,1,0,A61M16/0009;;A61M16/00;;A61M16/0075,A61M16/00,A5T TAD           TAD;;A5T T211          Y;;A5T T309          Y;;A5T T311          Y;;A5T T400          Y;;A5T T441          Y;;A5T T443          Y;;A5T T447          Y;;A5T T611          Y;;A5T T613          Y,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

FOX & CO., Ltd., D. Aug. 18, 1955 [Sept. 24, 1954], No. 27730/54. Class 125(2). In rotating table counterpressure bottling machines having filling tubes 26 the lower ends of which are closed by pear valves 27 closed by springs 30 and opened by fluid pressure acting on a piston 29, a single rotatable plug cock 14 actuated step by step by stationary trips supplies counterpressure and fluid pressure for actuating pistons 29 to each pair of filling tubes 26, a check valve 21 being provided for cutting off the counterpressure if a bottle should burst, but being prevented from closing during the application of counterpressure. As shown, extensions 102, 103 of a central body 10 are each provided with a depending filling tube 26 and the body 10 contains a vertical bore 11 containing a vertical plug cock 14 the shaft of which is extended upwardly and the end thereof is connected with a certain amount of lost motion to a star wheel 151 so that shock occurring when the trips actuate the star wheel is largely absorbed. Counterpressure is supplied through passages 19, 17 to the space 11 and bottling liquid through passages 20, 18 and a pair of passages 36 to chambers 24 communicating with the filling tubes 26. In operation, the parts are initially in a first stage in which the pear valves 27 are closed by springs 30 and the ports of cock 14 are also closed ; during this stage each bottle is raised to contact and raise a guide bell 32, a gasket 322 on which seats an annulus 253 fixed to the bottom of extensions 102, 103. The cock 14 is then rotated by the first trip to the second stage in which counterpressure can flow through passages 37 in the cock and passages 33, 34, 341 to the bottle ; during this stage the check valve 21 in the counterpressure supply is held from its seat by a projection 143 on the cock. The second trip then rotates the cock to the third stage in which the passages 37 still connect space 111 to passages 33 and also connect the space through passages 31 to space 221 above the piston 29 so that the counterpressure forces down the piston and opens valve 27 to allow liquid to flow into the bottle. During this stage, check valve 21 can move to its seat should a bottle burst and the passages are vented to atmosphere through the burst bottle so allowing spring 30 to close valve 27 ; also during this stage displaced gas flows from the bottle in reverse direction through passages 341, 34 and 33. The third trip then moves cock 14 to the fourth stage in which passages 38, 39, 40 therein connect passages 31, 33 to atmosphere so that spring 30 closes liquid valve 27 and the bottle head space is snifted. The cock is then turned to its initial position and the filled bottles are lowered.

Utilizing a multiple regression correlation technique in a predictive model, a correlation of weather variables with store information for specific locations and times is performed to quantify a weather impact model in terms of unit or dollar sales volume change, or any other commercially useful benchmark (704). The Executive Information System determines these relationships with location and time specificity. Using the relationship between historical weather and historical sales, the system 'deweatherizes' the historical weather to create a normalized historical sales relative to weather based on the 30 years average normal weather (720). The deweatherized data may be used in conjunction with a user-provided managerial plan to produce a revised managerial plan (207). Alternatively, the revised plan can be 'weatherized' by the system by applying forecasted weather to the weather impact model to generate a weather-modified managerial plan (204).",STRATEGIC WEATHER SERVICES,FOX FREDERICK D;;PEARSON DOUGLAS R;;RHOADS MICHAEL A;;ZALESKI PETER A,,https://lens.org/037-748-862-937-802,Patent Application,yes,2,1,4,4,0,G06Q10/06;;G06Q10/06,G06Q10/06,,1,0,,,"INTERCITY, ""The Weather Business"", February 1991, pages 29 and 31-32.",PENDING

The EIS system determines these relationships with location and time specificity. Using the relationship between historical weather and historical sales, the EIS system ""deweatherizes"" the historical weather to create a normalized historical sales relative to weather based upon normal weather (the 30 year average). This deweatherized data may be used in conjunction with a user-provided managerial plan to produce a revised managerial plan.

Using the relationship between historical weather and historical sales, the system ""deweatherizes"" the historical weather to create a normalized historical sales relative to weather based on the 30 years average normal weather (720). The deweatherized data may be used in conjunction with a user-provided managerial plan to produce a revised managerial plan (207).

The primary objective of a high performance air filter is to provide maximum particle removal while maintaininng an acceptable pressure drop. Conventional fibrous filters obtain improved particle removal efficiency by using filaments having small diameter, which can be packed closely together. This close packing results in smaller voids between the fibers, which increases the probability that particles will be intercepted by a fiber. This increase in particle removal is, however, accompanied by an increase in pressure drop. Excessive pressure drops can restrict air flow and shorten filter life. This invention provides filtration material comprising a web comprising continuous, meltblown fibers and staple, electrically charged fibers randomly dispersed among the continuous fibers. The filtration material can be formed in planar configurations and in configurations other than planar. Non-planar configurations can extend the useful working area for a given filter element's cross-section without requiring an additional corrugating or pleating process step. The filtration material exhibits high strength and low pressure drop.

    An apparatus and method of reclaiming a disk substrate. The cost of reclaiming a disk substrate can be lower, and the quality higher, than making a new one from a blank. A layer of a data storage disk is stripped, e.g., by acid/oxidizing bath immersion. The stripped disk is polished in a carrier between polishing pads, with the relative velocity of the polishing pads as seen by the disk being precisely controlled so that an equal amount of stock is removed from each side. Preferably, several stripped disks are sorted into groups based on disk thickness, and disks from one of the groups are simultaneously polished in the carrier. Sorting improves stock removal uniformity from disk to disk. The polished disks are cleaned and, preferably, ordered in a cassette for stacking in a storage device based on disk thickness to more easily meet a mean center specification.

   Corn oil and corn meal obtained from high oil corn are included in useful products. The corn oil is extracted from the high oil corn to form the corn meal. The corn oil generally comprises levels of nutrients not found in commercially available corn oils, since most or all of the corn grain, rather than just the germ, is exposed to the extraction process. The corn grain generally includes the steps of flaking corn grain having a total oil content of at least about 6 wt. % and extracting a corn oil from the flaked corn grain. The corn oil is useful for making nutritionally enhanced edible oil or cooking oil, lubricants, biodiesel, fuel, cosmetics and oil-based or oil-containing chemical products. The extracted corn meal is useful for making enhanced animal feed rations, snack food, blended food products, cosmetics, and fermentation broth additive.
