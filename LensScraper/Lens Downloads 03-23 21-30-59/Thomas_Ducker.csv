Taylor, T. D. April 2. Telegraphs.-The siphon of a siphon-recorder is vibrated mechanically by a rotating hexagonal or angular cam driven at high speed from the paperfeed mechanism. The shaft B, carrying the hexagonal cam A, is mounted in bearings C in the adjustable bracket K, and is rotated by a flexible band Q passing over a pulley E clamped to one of the wheels of the gearing G that drives the paperfeed wheels H. The cam A revolves between the paper J and the siphon I at a speed of about five hundred revolutions per minute. Reference is made to prior arrangements in which the siphon is vibrated by means of sound-discharges, or by a spring set in motion by an indented wheel, or by an electrically-operated thread.",TAYLOR THOMAS DUCKER,TAYLOR THOMAS DUCKER,,https://lens.org/190-733-643-811-412,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Electric copying machines. BLACKBURN AIRCRAFT Ltd. Sept. 18, 1961 [July 27, 1961], No. 27328/61. Class 38 (6). The stylus A of a template-following copying machine is supported for both axial and angular movement by a spherical bearing S; and through a ball and cone coupling, Fig. 2 (not shown), rocks a pivoted lever B. Movement of lever B moves a T-shaped contact plate G through a push-rod E. Plate G is pivoted at H and restrained by a tension spring M which urges the stylus A outwards. Plate G carries 6 contacts which co-operate with contacts on a further spring-loaded plate J carried by a pivot K at right-angles to pivot H. The contacts 1 close initially on outward movement of the stylus, governing movement of the cutter into the workpiece, and the contacts 2 close on angular movement of the stylus causing rocking of the lever B to control the cutter to move both inwards and sideways. Axial inwards displacement of the stylus further displaces the lever B to close the contacts 3 and move the cutter sideways, and still further displacement of lever B on angular movement of the stylus closes contacts 4 to move the cutter both sideways and outwards, with further inwards axial movement of the stylus causing contacts 5 to close and move the cutter outwards. Any further axial movement of the stylus closes contacts 6 to stop further movement of the cutter.",BLACKBURN AIRCRAFT LTD,BANCROFT THOMAS;;WALKER SAMUEL;;DUCKER GEOFFREY BOWER;;LUCAS JAMES EDWARD,,https://lens.org/170-554-216-956-036,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,3,0,B23Q35/32;;Y10T409/303528;;Y10T409/303528;;B23Q35/32,B23Q35/32,G3N NG2           G2;;G3N N2            D;;G3N N252          D;;G3N N292          G2;;G3N N353          D,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
