The filament assembly or subassemblies thus produced are further stabilized by folding, bundling, twisting or intertwining, e.g. to form braids ( 10 ), and are then bonded to a carrier layer or sandwiched between outer layers ( 12, 14 ), e.g. by hydroentanglement, melt blowing, spinbonding etc. The stabilized filament assemblies may be arranged spaced transversely and may be cut just prior to bonding so as also to provide longitudinally spaced three dimensionally thicker regions, ready for conversion to finished products such as absorbant feminine hygiene products or medical swabs or the like.",LOHMANN GMBH & CO KG,BARTH GEORG MARTIN;;CARUS EDMUND HUGH;;GREEN,,https://lens.org/111-499-372-327-910,Granted Patent,no,0,0,20,20,0,B32B5/26;;B32B7/04;;D02G1/00;;D04H3/04;;D04H3/07;;D04H3/11;;D04H3/14;;D04H13/00;;Y10T428/2913;;Y10T442/643;;Y10T442/608;;Y10T442/659;;Y10T428/2913;;Y10T442/643;;Y10T442/608;;Y10T442/659;;B32B2307/73;;B32B2305/20;;B32B2262/04;;B32B38/06;;B32B2038/0028;;B32B5/26;;D04H3/14;;D04H3/04;;B32B7/04;;D02G1/00;;D04H3/07;;D04H13/00;;D04H3/11,B32B5/26;;D02G1/00;;D04H3/04;;D04H3/07;;D04H3/11;;D04H3/14;;D04H13/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
