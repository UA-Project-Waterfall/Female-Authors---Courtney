    A system for measuring the weight of a seat occupant is used to control airbag deployment. The system includes a plurality of weight sensors that have a first end mounted to a seat riser and a second end mounted to a seat frame or track member. The weight sensors have a central bendable portion that extends between the first and second ends. A groove is formed in one of the external surfaces of the central bendable portion to localize strain. A full bridge strain gage assembly is mounted on a surface of each of the weight sensors, opposite from the groove, for generating a weight signal in response to measuring deflection of the central bendable portion. A central processor determines seat occupant weight based on the weight signals and an airbag control module communicates with the processor. The control module controls deployment force of the airbag based on seat occupant weight.

   A system for measuring the weight of a seat occupant is used to control airbag deployment. The system includes a plurality of weight sensors that have a first end mounted to a seat riser and a second end mounted to a seat frame or track member. The weight sensors have a central bendable portion that extends between the first and second ends. A groove is formed in one of the external surfaces of the central bendable portion to localize strain. A full bridge strain gage assembly is mounted on a surface of each of the weight sensors, opposite from the groove, for generating a weight signal in response to measuring deflection of the central bendable portion. A central processor determines seat occupant weight based on the weight signals and an airbag control module communicates with the processor. The control module controls deployment force of the airbag based on seat occupant weight.

    A pile fabric may be employed in automotive, furniture upholstery and other applications. Pile surfaces on such fabrics may be provided in tufts, or collections of fiber bundles, arranged in rows upon a base portion. Fabrics and methods of making fabrics which minimize the average amount of void space between respective tufts or rows are disclosed. Fabrics which provide more effective overall fabric coverage upon base portions of the fabric are described. A method of heat shocking fibers during the drawing of said fibers to pre-stress the fiber and thereby produce a fabric having greater bloom or bulk is disclosed. Providing differential heat history to predetermined portions of the fiber may be a suitable manner of obtaining a fiber which can be used to form a fabric having greater bulk.

Opposite sides of the cart defining the access openings are sealed by pivoting doors which open towards each other and against a common endwall. One of the doors is hinged in conventional manner as by the use of pairs of cooperating, vertically spaced brackets and hinge pins. A pin is pivoted in a portion of each bracket extending beyond the common endwall so that the one door can be swung through a 270.degree. range to seat flushly against the endwall. The invention contemplates the provision of a lengthened bracket associated with the door opposite the first door. The second door is pivoted about a point further from the plane of the endwall than the pivot on the first door. The second door can thus be folded in parallel, overlapping relationship with the first door whereas it would otherwise interfere with the corner at the free end of the first door.",CARTER HOFFMAN CORP,PINNOW CURTIS C;;GILL BRIAN,CARTER-HOFFMAN CORP.

   Weight sensor assemblies for measuring weight on a vehicle seat are mounted at the connecting points between a seat bottom frame and a seat mounting member. The weight sensor assemblies each include a beam member having a bendable center body portion for supporting a stain gage. The strain gage and associated traces are screen printed on the surface of the beam. The beam acts similar to a dual constrained cantilever beam, concentrating the bending at a reduced neck section that narrows in the middle of the center body portion. The strain gage measures strain resulting from bending in the center body portion caused by a weight force being applied against the seat.

For each routine declaration found, an entry in a first table in a database is generated and a routine identifier for the routine entered. In response to each identifier entered, the routines corresponding thereto are searched for calls to other routines. For each call, entry in a second table is generated in which, in a first field, the identifier of the routine being searched is written, and in a second field, an identifier for the called routine is written. The user may select for outputting the routines called by a particular routine, in which case, the entries are accessed via the first field and the contents of the second field are output.

   In a first embodiment of the invention, a method and system of recording successive holograms in a recording medium is presented. The method utilizes a multilayer holographic storage media comprising a reflective substrate layer, a polarization shifting layer disposed above the reflective substrate layer, and a photorecording medium layer disposed above the polarization shifting layer. A reference beam and an encoded object beam are propagated at a first direction to a first area of the photorecording medium layer, where the reference beam and encoded object beam have a same first polarization and interfere to produce a first interference grating. The reference beam and the encoded object beam are reflected with the reflective substrate layer to produce a reflected reference beam and reflected encoded object beam incident the photorecording medium at a second direction, where the reference beam polarization and a encoded object beam polarization are altered with the polarization shifting layer so that the reflected reference beam and reflected encoded object beam have a same second polarization. The reflected reference beam and reflected encoded object beam interfere to produce a second interference grating, with the first polarization and second polarization being different. Successive holograms are recorded by translating the multilayer holographic storage media or reference and object beam along a shift multiplex direction, where the reference beam and object beam are propagated to successive areas of the photorecording medium.

    A vehicle seat assembly  12  is mounted to a vehicle base member  24  such as a riser or a vehicle floor. Weight sensor assemblies  32  for measuring weight on the vehicle seat are mounted to a seat structural component. The weight sensor assemblies  32  each include plate  44  having a bendable center body portion  46  for supporting a strain gage  48  . The strain gage  48  measures bending in the center body portion  46  caused by normal weight force applications on the vehicle seat  12  .

The beam member  34  prevents permanent deformation of the plate  44  and strain gage failure by allowing the weight sensor  32  to deflect upwardly away from the vehicle floor. An overload stop  68  reacts between the seat structural component and the vehicle floor to prevent seat separation under overload conditions.

    A terminator assembly for a twinax wire. According to this embodiment, a PCB is provided which receives the twinax wire and provides a positive connection between a grounding bar of the PCB and the drain wide of the twinax pair. The drain wire is extended in an orthogonal direction to the twinax pair, and is engaged using an interference fit with the grounding bar. The grounding bar assembly also provides improved shielding for the twinax pair, where the integral shielding of the twinax wire has been removed to provide the connection. In an alternate embodiment, the terminating end of the twinax wire itself is encased in a termination clip.

If the sensed orientation of the equipment is not within the acceptable range, the control logic transmits a notification signal so that corrective action can occur. As an example, the notification signal may be used to notify a user of the improper orientation.

   A method for making a thermal insulating material includes the steps of: providing a chamber, placing hollow geometric shapes in the chamber, closing the chamber, evacuating air from the chamber, feeding a slurry into an adjacent slurry chamber, pressurizing the slurry chamber and forcing the slurry in to the sphere chamber around the spheres against a fibrous material adjacent a side wall of the sphere chamber. The fibrous material allows capillary wicking of the liquid from the slurry around the spheres. Due to this pressure the spheres and slurry are semi dried into a green state.

   An air bag sensor module fastening device for a vehicle is provided includes a vehicle mounting structure having an internally threaded member. A sensor is secured to a base for sensing vibrations caused by a crash of the vehicle. The base has an aperture extending therethrough that is aligned with the internally threaded member. The aperture includes a retaining portion. A fastener for securing the base to the vehicle mounting structure has a shaft with a head and a threaded portion opposite the head. The threaded portion is temporarily retained within the retaining portion in a shipping position. The threaded portion has a minor diameter and the shaft portion has a shaft diameter less than the minor diameter. As a result, the shaft will not be in an interference fit relationship with the retaining portion so that the compressive load of the fastener alone secures the base to the vehicle mounting structure. The threaded portion is disposed outside of the retaining portion in an installed position in which the threaded portion is received in the internally threaded member to secure the base to the vehicle mounting structure. In this manner, the threaded portion will engage only the internally threaded member so that the base is secured to the vehicle mounting structure by the compressive load of the fastener alone.

    An air bag sensor module fastening device for a vehicle is provided includes a vehicle mounting structure having an internally threaded member. A sensor is secured to a base for sensing vibrations caused by a crash of the vehicle. The base has an aperture extending therethrough that is aligned with the internally threaded member. The aperture includes a retaining portion. A fastener for securing the base to the vehicle mounting structure has a shaft with a head and a threaded portion opposite the head. The threaded portion is temporarily retained within the retaining portion in a shipping position. The threaded portion has a minor diameter and the shaft portion has a shaft diameter less than the minor diameter. As a result, the shaft will not be in an interference fit relationship with the retaining portion so that the compressive load of the fastener alone secures the base to the vehicle mounting structure. The threaded portion is disposed outside of the retaining portion in an installed position in which the threaded portion is received in the internally threaded member to secure the base to the vehicle mounting structure. In this manner, the threaded portion will engage only the internally threaded member so that the base is secured to the vehicle mounting structure by the compressive load of the fastener alone.

The method also involves employing the rotation induced in trapped particles by optical vortices to assemble clusters of particles into functional micromachines, to drive previously assembled micromachines, to pump fluids through microfluidics channels, to control flows of fluids through microfluidics channels, to mix fluids within microfluidics channels, to transport particles, to sort particles and to perform other related manipulations and transformations on matter over length scales",UNIV CHICAGO,CURTIS JENNIFER E;;KOSS BRIAN A;;GRIER DAVID G,,https://lens.org/140-873-328-554-277,Patent Application,yes,5,10,12,12,0,B01L3/50273;;B01L3/502761;;B01L2200/0647;;B01L2200/0668;;B01L2400/0409;;B01L2400/0454;;F04B19/006;;G01N30/00;;G01N30/02;;G02B21/32;;G03H1/0005;;G03H1/08;;G03H1/2294;;G03H2001/0077;;G03H2001/085;;G03H2225/32;;H05H3/04;;B01F33/251;;B01F35/3205;;G01N15/149;;H05H3/04;;B01L3/50273;;G03H1/2294;;B01L2200/0647;;F04B19/006;;B01L2400/0409;;G01N30/02;;B01L2200/0668;;B01L2400/0454;;G03H2225/32;;G02B21/32;;G03H1/08;;G03H2001/0077;;G01N30/00;;G03H2001/085;;B01L3/502761;;G03H1/0005;;B01F33/251;;B01F35/3205;;G01N15/149,G01N15/02;;B01J19/12;;H01J40/14;;G01N30/00;;G01N30/02;;G01V8/00;;G06M7/00;;G21K1/00;;H05H3/04,250/221;;250/222.2,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A method for creating large numbers of high-quality optical traps in arbitrary three-dimensional configurations and dynamically reconfiguring the traps under computer control. The method uses computer-generated diffractive optical elements to convert one or more optical tweezers into one or more optical vortices. The method involves combining the optical vortex technique with the holographic optical tweezer technique to create multiple optical vortices in arbitrary configurations. The method also involves employing the rotation induced in trapped particles by optical vortices to assemble clusters of particles into functional micromachines, to drive previously assembled micromachines, to pump fluids through microfluidics channels, to control flows of fluids through microfluidics channels, to mix fluids within microfluidics channels, to transport particles, to sort particles and to perform other related manipulations and transformations on matter over length scales

The collar removal tool can be an accessory attachment that couples to the power tool. The collar removal tool can be designed to grip the fastener collar via a collet mechanism that is self-tightening using the power tool. The collar may be removed with the tool running in the reverse rotation, which is the same direction of rotation required to tighten the collet on the collar by raising the collet up into a collet holder. After the collar is loosened and removed from the bolt, the tool can be run in the forward direction and the collar mechanism can automatically loosen the collet on the collar.

   A method for creating large numbers of high-quality optical traps in arbitrary three-dimensional configurations and dynamically reconfiguring the traps under computer control. The method uses computer-generated diffractive optical elements to convert one or more optical tweezers into one or more optical vortices. The method involves combining the optical vortex technique with the holographic optical tweezer technique to create multiple optical vortices in arbitrary configurations. The method also involves employing the rotation induced in trapped particles by optical vortices to assemble clusters of particles into functional micromachines, to drive previously assembled micromachines, to pump fluids through microfluidics channels, to control flows of fluids through microfluidics channels, to mix fluids within microfluidics channels, to transport particles, to sort particles and to perform other related manipulations and transformations on matter over length scales

    The invention permits a user, such as a network administrator, to remotely initiate and control the diagnostics of a node of a networked computer system. This diagnostic control is performed by the user selecting a diagnostic routine that is to be executed. This diagnostic routine instructs the managed node to collect configuration or other data and report this data back to the diagnostic control, which is then reported back to the user. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the system includes a management client executing a user interface, such as a Web browser. The system also includes a management server executing a Web server, wherein the Web server is configured to be invoked by the user interface (e.g., by specifying a URL). The management server further includes software for dynamically serving data to the Web server, and at least one diagnostic control (e.g., COM object) that defines a plurality of diagnostic steps to perform on a managed object. Finally, the system includes a managed object (e.g., a network node) having data control software configured to collect data from the managed object in response to specific requests made by the diagnostic control. Preferably, the data control software is configured reports the collected data back to the diagnostic control over the computer network.
