The chamber was maintained at 100~200 Pa with a constant flow of pure Argon. In this experimental condition, the high temperature region ZnO powder was evaporated and the nanowires of ZnO were grow by reacting with gold catalysts at the downstream side of furnace. Therefore, different sizes of ZnO nanowires can be controled through the size of metal catalysts.And the length of the ZnO nanowires was increaced with increasing growth time.The diameter and length of ZnO nanowires controlled method can apply in selective growth of ZnO nanowires devices.

The substrate is improved in hardness and flexibility by an additive; original gum plastication and banburying (or opening milling) processes are used to uniformly spreading lead powder or boron carbide in the rubber substrate; and finally oxidization and crosslinking reaction are performed to form the radiation resistant rubber material having arbitrary plasticity, excellent shielding performance, excellent flexibility and excellent structural adaptability. The preparation process of the invention adopts a 'peroxidation' method rather than a 'vulcanization' method in the crosslinking reaction for forming the flexible shielding material, so the shielding material is free from sulfur and suitable for use in the field of nuclear power. Tests show that the shielding material has a lead weight content of 78 percent, a boron carbide weight content of more than 35 percent, a hardness of 43 DEG (Shore A) and a tensile elongation of 0.32mmPb and meets requirements of GB16363-1996 X Ray Protective Material Shielding Performance and Test Method in terms of other performance data.",NUCLEAR POWER INST CHINA,SHIQUAN TAO;;XIAOMIN WANG;;MING FU;;LUQIANG QIU;;FANG LI;;KAI KANG,,https://lens.org/028-167-147-681-041,Patent Application,no,0,5,2,2,0,,C08L9/06;;C08J3/24;;C08K3/26;;C08K13/02,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The mechanism can also include a component to move semiconductor wafers through the chemical in the container in a Ferris wheel-like motion. The component may include wafer holders for the wafers that are swivably mounted about an axis of rotation. As the one or more wafer holders rotate about the axis of rotation through the chemical in the container, the wafer holders remain in a substantially constant vertical and horizontal orientation.

    A method including the acts of providing a semiconductor device having a plurality of misalignment ruler markers formed therein for measuring removable layer opening misalignment in the X and Y directions, a bond pad and the passivation layer with an opening therein down to the bond pad. A removable layer is formed over the semiconductor device and includes an opening therein down to the bond pad. Preferably this action includes depositing, patterning and developing a dry photoresist film layer over the semiconductor device with an opening therein down to the bond pad. The next act includes measuring the misalignment of the opening in the passivation layer by counting the number of misalignment ruler markers visibly exposed by the opening in the X-direction and also the Y-direction.

   A new method is provided for the processing of metals, most notably copper, such that damage to exposed surfaces of these metals is prevented. During a step of semiconductor processing, which results in exposing a metal surface to a wet substance having a pH value, a voltage is applied to the metal that is exposed. The value of the applied voltage can, dependent on the value of the pH constant of the wet substance, be selected such that the exposed metal surface is protected against alkaline effects of the wet substance.

   A new method is provided for the creation of a solder bump. Conventional methods are initially followed, creating a patterned layer of Under Bump Metal over the surface of a contact pad. A layer of photoresist is next deposited, this layer of photoresist is patterned and developed creating a resist mask having a T-shape opening aligned with the contact pad. This T-shaped opening is filled with a solder compound, creating a T-shaped layer of solder compound on the surface of the layer of UBM. The layer of photoresist is removed, exposing the created T-shaped layer of solder compound, further exposing the layer of UBM. The layer of UBM is etched using the T-shaped layer of solder compound as a mask. Reflow of the solder compound results in creating a solder ball.

    A new method is provided for the creation of a solder bump. Conventional methods are initially followed, creating a patterned layer of Under Bump Metal over the surface of a contact pad. A layer of photoresist is next deposited, this layer of photoresist is patterned and developed creating a resist mask having a T-shape opening aligned with the contact pad. This T-shaped opening is filled with a solder compound, creating a T-shaped layer of solder compound on the surface of the layer of UBM. The layer of photoresist is removed, exposing the Created T-shaped layer of solder compound, further exposing the layer of UBM. The layer of UBM is etched using the T-shaped layer of solder compound as a mask. Reflow of the solder compound results in creating a solder ball.
