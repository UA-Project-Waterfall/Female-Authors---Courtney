A incerteza nas estampas de tempo de recepção é removida pela gravação do tempo de chegada no relógio de hardware do servidor de NTP, antes dos pacotes de entrada poderem ser atrasados por atravessarem as várias camadas de software em um sistema de timestamping. A incerteza nas estampas de tempo de transmissão é removida ao se proporcionar aos pacotes de saída uma timestamp no futuro usando uma estimativa de uma latência de transmissão calculada pelo filtro estimador de latência. Subseqüentemente, o tempo de partida real é usado para se recalcular e atualizar a timestamp da latência de transmissão.
