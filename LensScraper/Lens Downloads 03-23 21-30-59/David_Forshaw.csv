The apparatus instructs a user to connect the extraction device to reagent receptacle 120a, the reagent having not previously been used. When connected, the extraction device takes reagent out of the receptacle for use in the apparatus only if information read by the tag reader from a machine-readable tag attached to the receptacle (122, Fig. 3) indicates that the reagent is unused, and perhaps of a specified type (e.g. alcohol) and concentration. The tag may be rewritable; the apparatus may return reagent after use to the receptacle and update, using a tag writer, the information to indicate that the reagent has been used. The tag and reader may be of RFID type, perhaps a passive RFID tag powered by electromagnetic radiation from an external source. The apparatus may house multiple reagent receptacles and extraction devices in storage area 105.",THERMO SHANDON LTD,PETER DANIEL ROBINSON;;MICHAEL JAMES FORSHAW;;DAVID JOHN CHAN;;MARK BAKER;;DAVID MCNULTY;;MARC NEILL MURPHY,,https://lens.org/150-599-788-236-61X,Patent Application,no,0,0,13,13,0,B01L9/52;;G01N1/312;;G01N35/00732;;G01N1/30;;G01N1/31;;G01N1/34;;G01N1/36;;G01N35/00663;;G01N35/00732;;G01N35/1002;;G01N2035/00673;;B01L9/52;;G01N1/312;;G01N1/34;;G01N1/36;;G01N35/00663;;G01N35/00732;;G01N35/1002;;G01N2035/00673,G01N1/30;;G01N1/31;;G01N1/34;;G01N1/36;;G01N35/00;;G01N35/10,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
