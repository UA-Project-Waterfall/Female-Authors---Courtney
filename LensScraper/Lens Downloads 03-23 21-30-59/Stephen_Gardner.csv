   Methods and apparatuses are provided for use in multi-pass printing, which, through the selective ordering of the application of inks to a print media, promote increased dot gain when desired and decreased dot gain when desired. For example, an adaptable print mode method is provided to select between a dark dot gain print mode and an object definition print mode. The dark dot gain print mode causes at least one dark color ink to be selectively applied to a dry portion of a print media. Thereafter, at least one light color ink is selectively applied to the portion of the print media while it is still wet from the application of the dark color ink(s). Conversely, the object definition print mode is configured to cause at least one light color ink to be selectively applied to a dry portion of the print media, and thereafter at least one dark color ink is selectively applied to the portion of the print media while it is still wet from the application of the light color ink(s).

    A system and method to create child objects from parent objects in an action diary. Child objects are created with increasing specificity regarding a system situation. A method is provided for associating an action diary based on the parent class of an object, even if there are no instances of objects of the parent class. A knowledge expert creates an action diary and associate that diary with a parent class object. The children of that class have the class generic action diary available to assist the operator in handling new situations. As the operators improve the handling of a specific situation, a new action diary is created by including information and actions in from the original action diary and can be associated with the specific child object. Thus the evolution of knowledge can orderly proceed from a general type to a specific.

The control includes an actuating lever mounted on the tractor chassis, and control cables extending between the actuating lever and the clutch, and between the actuating lever and the transmission forward-reverse shift linkage. Movement of the actuating lever in the forward direction shifts the transmission linkage to the forward position and releases the clutch to engage the driving and driven pulleys with one another. Further forward motion of the actuating lever causes a greater coupling of the driving and driven pulleys to cause the lawn tractor to move forward faster. Returning of the actuating lever to a neutral position disengages the clutch and moves the transmission shift linkage to neutral. Movement of the actuating lever in a reverse direction shifts the transmission linkage into reverse gear, and couples the driving and driven pulleys together.

The two gear stages are interconnected with a mechanical fuse or shearout (40) designed to fail under excess shear loads and protect components downstream of the input shaft (10) from excess torque in the event of a system jam. The shearout (40) is essentially a quill shaft with external splines at both ends and an hourglass-shaped shear neckdown in the middle. The purpose of the no-back brake (50) is to prevent air loads from causing slat movement in the event of a torque tube disconnect. Referring to Figure, the no-back consists of a set of ball ramp (22) and brake plate components connected to the gearbox's output shaft. The ball ramp device converts part of the back driving torque into the axial force required to clamp the brake stack components (30) and restrain the output shaft.

In some examples, there is provided a method for implementing ad hoc groups in a policy hierarchy environment, the method including: receiving a key orchestration operation request at a client associated with a node, a group, and a user; applying a sum of policies associated with the node to the request; applying a sum of policies associated with the group to the request; applying a sum of policies associated with the client to the request; applying a sum of policies associated with the user to the request; and evaluating the key orchestration operation request based on each of the sum of policies of the node, the group, the client, and the user.",FORNETIX LLC,EDWARDS STEPHEN;;STUEVE GERALD J;;GARDNER GARY C;;WHITE CHARLES,FORNETIX LLC (2016-09-28),https://lens.org/186-041-542-902-284,Granted Patent,yes,221,0,7,99,0,G06F21/604;;G06F21/6209;;H04L63/20;;H04L63/20;;H04L9/0836;;H04L9/088;;H04L63/061;;H04L63/062;;H04L63/064;;H04L63/0853;;H04L63/104,H04L29/06;;G06F21/60;;G06F21/62;;H04L9/08,,70,2,121-168-075-305-13X;;024-721-671-977-05X,10.1007/bfb0052240;;10.1109/srds.2006.15,"Wang et al., An Efficient File Hierarchy Attribute-Based Encryption Scheme in Cloud Computing, IEEE (Year: 2016).;;International Search Report and Written Opinion dated Aug. 30, 2016, from related application No. PCT/US2016/022363.;;International Search Report and Written Opinion dated Aug. 30, 2016, from related application No. PCT/US2016/022366.;;PCT International Search Report and Written Opinion dated Jul. 12, 2016, from related application No. PCT/US2016/022360.;;PCT International Search Report and Written Opinion dated Jun. 29, 2016, from related application No. PCT/US2016/022357.;;Chae, et al, “A Key Recovery Attack on Discrete Log-based Schemes Using a Prime Order Subgroup”, ICRC 2010, pp. 249-262.;;International Preliminary Report on Patentability dated Sep. 21, 2017, from application No. PCT/US2016/022357.;;International Preliminary Report on Patentability dated Sep. 21, 2017, from application No. PCT/US2016/022360.;;International Preliminary Report on Patentability dated Sep. 21, 2017, from application No. PCT/US2016/022363.;;International Preliminary Report on Patentability dated Sep. 28, 2017, from application No. PCT/US2016/022366.;;U.S. Office Action dated Oct. 27, 2017, from U.S. Appl.

The invention finds particular application in the transmission of dual polarisation quadrature phase shift keying (DP-QPSK) signals. The integrated optics block 100 for the transmitter integrates a beam splitter 102, a polarisation rotator 106 and a polarisation combiner 104. The beam splitter 102 splits an input optical signal, Lz in, into a first input signal 218 for input to an optical modulator unit 206 and a second signal 220 which is suitable for use as a local oscillator signal of a co-located receiver. The polarisation rotator rotates the polarisation a second modulated light signal 224 output from the optical modulator unit 224 through 90 degrees so that its polarisation is orthogonal to that of a first polarisation signal 222 output from modulator unit. The first modulated signal and the phase rotated second modulated signal are combined in polarisation combiner 109 to form an output signal, S out, for transmission to a remote receiver (Fig. 10). The integrated optics block may be fabricated from a plurality of prisms and a waveplate.

The sensor system includes at least two sensor electrodes and a capacitance sensing circuit. When a non-capacitive object, such as a pest, approaches the sensor electrodes, the capacitance of the sensor electrodes increases due to the object having a higher dielectric constant than air.

These three-dimensional physical objects have improved mechanical properties over existing direct manufactured objects. The direct manufacturing process includes an extrusion process, a polymer application process, and a solidification process. The extrusion process deposits a thermoplastic polymer in a series of sequential layers wherein the series of sequential layers are deposited in predetermined patterns. The polymer application process applies compatible polymer(s) after the deposition of each thermoplastic layer.

Electrolytically reducing halide content of chromate solutions. DIAMOND SHAMROCK CORP. Feb.13, 1968 [Feb. 15, 1967], No. 6980/68. Heading C7B. The halide content of an aqueous chromate solution is reduced by subjecting the solution to electrolysis in a diaphragm-less electrolytic cell whereby at least a portion of the halide e. g. fluoride, chloride or bromide is converted to gaseous halogen and liberated from the solution. The aqueous chromate solution may contain up to 90% by weight of chromate and electrolysis may be conducted at a current density of 0À1-0À2 amps/ sq. inch. The anode may be of titanium coated with platinum or lead peroxide, of lead, or of graphite coated with lead peroxide, and the cathode may be of steel. The anode-cathode gap may be 0À15-0À5. The process may be carried out using a bank of multiple cells connected in series with respect to both the solution and current flow. The process may also be carried out using a cylindrical steel cell, the shell of which forms the cathode, the anode being formed by a circular foraminous platinum-coated titanium screen, and the cell being fitted with a mechanical stirrer.",DIAMOND SHAMROCK CORP,SCHOENDORFER GEORGE FRED;;MORSCHHAUSER ROGER JOHN;;GARDNER THOMAS STEPHEN;;THOMPSON DONALD LEE,,https://lens.org/108-234-004-587-805,Granted Patent,no,0,0,4,5,0,C07C281/20;;C07C281/20;;C01G37/14;;C01G37/14;;C07C2601/14;;C07C2601/14,C01G37/14;;C07C281/20,C7B BA2C2         BA2C;;C7B BA9           BA2C;;C7B BBC           BC;;C7B BBC           DM12;;C7B BBRX          BRX;;C7B BDM           BC;;C7B BDM           DM12;;C7B BDS           DS10;;C7B BDWA          DWA;;C7B BR            R;;C7B BRB           RB;;C7B B102          BC;;C7B B102          DM12;;C7B B102          DS10;;C7B B102          R;;C7B B125          BC;;C7B B125          DM12;;C7B B148          DM12;;C7B B2A           -;;C7B B2X           -;;C7B B503          BC;;C7B B503          DS10;;C7B B510          BC;;C7B B510          DS10;;C7B B511          DS10;;C7B B512          DS10;;C7B B513          BC;;C7B B513          DS10;;C7B B525          BC;;C7B B525          DS10;;C7B B527          BC;;C7B B608          DS10;;C7B B613          DS10;;C7B B755          DS10;;C7B B756          DM12;;C7B B756          DS10;;C7B B756          R;;C7B B760          DM12;;C7B B760          DS10;;C7B B760          R;;C7B B8            -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Gas phase epitaxial growth techniques are utilized at low temperatures to produce indium phosphide layers having a resistivity greater than approximately 10.sup.7 ohm-cm. According to the preferred embodiment carbon tetrachloride is used as a dopant at flow rates above 5 sccm to grow the layers with substrate growth temperatures ranging from approximately 460.degree. C. to 525.degree. C. This temperature range provides an advantage over the transition metal techniques for doping indium phosphide since the high temperatures generally required for those techniques limit the ability to control growth. Good surface morphology is also obtained through the growth according to the present invention.

   A generic interface layer for providing a generic interface to a hardware environment for a program executing on the hardware environment. The generic interface layer is interrupt-driven. It includes driver code for devices in the hardware environment that is executed in response to software interrupts from the program and interrupt handling code for handling interrupts from the hardware environment. The interrupt handling code responds to an interrupt by calling a callback in the program. The generic interface layer includes a loader for loading the program and a debugger for controlling execution of the program. 

   Execution of code in the generic interface layer may be coordinated by the system timer interrupt code that is executed in response to a system timer interrupt. Code that is executing in the generic interface layer may register itself or other code with the system timer interrupt code, which then executes the code in response to a system timer interrupt. One use of the technique is to permit driver code to register other code and then quickly return to the program and thereby prevent long suspension of the program. 

   Also disclosed is a technique for managing a statically-allocated array of buffers for receiving LAN packets to reduce the frequency of an out of resource condition.

    A generic interface layer for providing a generic interface to a hardware environment for a program executing on the hardware environment. The generic interface layer, is interrupt-driven. It includes driver code for devices in the hardware environment that is executed in response to software interrupts from the program and interrupt handling code for handling interrupts from the hardware environment. The interrupt handling code responds to an interrupt by calling a callback in the program. The generic interface layer includes a loader for loading the program and a debugger for controlling execution of the program. 

    Execution of code in the generic interface layer may be coordinated by the system timer interrupt code that is executed in response to a system timer interrupt. Code that is executing in the generic interface layer may register itself or other code with the system timer interrupt code, which then executes the code in response to a system timer interrupt. One use of the technique is to permit driver code to register other code and then quickly return to the program and thereby prevent long suspension of the program. 

    Also disclosed is a technique for managing a statically-allocated array of buffers for receiving LAN packets to reduce the frequency of an out of resource condition.

   A reporting system for collecting, communicating and analyzing information from a plurality of pest monitoring locations is disclosed. The monitored locations include activity sensing pest devices. These devices can include traps and/or passive and active monitoring devices not having a trapping or killing functionality. While traps may constitute the majority of activity sensing pest devices in a given pest control program, devices which only monitor pest activity may be preferred in some locations and applications. The system includes automatic reporting from the plurality of activity sensing pest devices and also includes physical inspection data. Preferably an automatic real-time communication system is used, with the preferred communication system being a radio-frequency (RF) or other over-the-air system.

   The present invention is a display apparatus that provides protection against damage for a metallic layer. The display apparatus includes a light modulating layer, a polarizer, and a light directing film. The light directing film includes a prismatic structure having two sides, where one side includes saw tooth formations having tilted surfaces and a metal layer on the side of the prismatic substrate having the saw-tooth formations. A tilt angle of the tilted surfaces offsets an optimal viewing angle for the display from a glare angle for the display. In a first embodiment of the invention, the light directing film of the display apparatus further includes an inorganic protective layer formed on the metal layer, wherein the inorganic protective layer inhibits molecular transfer to the metal layer and balances the color of reflected and transmitted light. The light directing film further includes a pressure sensitive adhesive layer between a polarizer and the inorganic protective layer. Alternatively, the light directing film of the display apparatus of the present invention includes a polymer protective layer formed over the metal layer to protect the metal layer from damage. The light directing film also includes a diffuse adhesive layer formed over the polymer layer, attached to the polarizer. The polymer protective layer protects the metal layer from the adhesive layer. The display apparatus may include both the inorganic protective layer and the polymer protective layer, in one embodiment.

A seal ring positioned in the bore adjacent the inlet port sealingly surrounds the poppet in its closed position. The seal ring is axially compressed between a retainer ring and a backup surface, and a ring nut threaded in the bore compressively engages the retainer ring. The ring nut is located entirely on the inlet port side of the outlet port so it does not inhibit flow to the outlet port when the poppet is open. A poppet guide bore in the bonnet extends inwardly from a bonnet end surface, and a pair of concentric recesses of different diameters also extend into the bonnet from the end surface. One recess receives a seal ring positioned in surrounding sealing relationship with the poppet, and the other recess receives a push-in retainer for retaining the seal ring in its recess. A small diameter stem on the poppet extends into a bonnet spring receiving bore and has a rounded end received by a conical recess in a guide disc. Close fitting cylindrical locating surfaces are used for providing accurate concentricity between the bonnet and body, and between the retainer ring and the bore.",NUPRO CO,BORK CARL R JR;;STEISS WILLIAM C;;TOBBE WILLIAM P;;SHUFFLEBARGER EARL D;;MATOUSEK STEPHEN;;GARDNER THOMAS J,,https://lens.org/170-952-875-517-401,Granted Patent,no,0,0,11,11,0,F16K1/46;;F16K17/04;;F16K41/04;;Y10T137/7868;;Y10T137/7929;;Y10T137/7925;;F16K17/04;;F16K41/04;;F16K1/46;;F16K17/04;;F16K15/063;;F16K15/025,F16K1/42;;F16K1/46;;F16K17/04;;F16K41/04,137-64,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    The present invention is a display apparatus that provides protection against damage for a metallic layer. The display apparatus includes a light modulating layer, a polarizer, and a light directing film. The light directing film includes a prismatic structure having two sides, where one side includes saw tooth formations having tilted surfaces and a metal layer on the side of the prismatic substrate having the saw-tooth formations. A tilt angle of the tilted surfaces offsets an optimal viewing angle for the display from a glare angle for the display. In a first embodiment of the invention, the light directing film of the display apparatus further includes an inorganic protective layer formed on the metal layer, wherein the inorganic protective layer inhibits molecular transfer to the metal layer and balances the color of reflected and transmitted light. The light directing film further includes a pressure sensitive adhesive layer between a polarizer and the inorganic protective layer. Alternatively, the light directing film of the display apparatus of the present invention includes a polymer protective layer formed over the metal layer to protect the metal layer from damage. The light directing film also includes a diffuse adhesive layer formed over the polymer layer, attached to the polarizer. The polymer protective layer protects the metal layer from the adhesive layer. The display apparatus may include both the inorganic protective layer and the polymer protective layer, in one embodiment.

   A smoothing structure containing indium is formed between the substrate and the active region of a III-nitride light emitting device to improve the surface characteristics of the device layers. In some embodiments, the smoothing structure is a single layer, separated from the active region by a spacer layer which typically does not contain indium. The smoothing layer contains a composition of indium lower than the active region, and is typically deposited at a higher temperature than the active region. The spacer layer is typically deposited while reducing the temperature in the reactor from the smoothing layer deposition temperature to the active region deposition temperature. In other embodiments, a graded smoothing region is used to improve the surface characteristics. The smoothing region may have a graded composition, graded dopant concentration, or both.

A seal ring positioned in the bore adjacent the inlet port sealingly surrounds the poppet in its closed position. The seal ring is axially compressed between a retainer ring and a backup surface, and a ring nut threaded in the bore compressively engages the retainer ring. The ring nut is located entirely on the inlet port side of the outlet port so it does not inhibit flow to the outlet port when the poppet is open. A poppet guide bore in the bonnet extends inwardly from a bonnet end surface, and a pair of concentric recesses of different diameters also extend into the bonnet from the end surface. One recess receives a seal ring positioned in surrounding sealing relationship with the poppet, and the other recess receives a push-in retainer for retaining the seal ring in its recess. A small diameter stem on the poppet extends into a bonnet spring receiving bore and has a rounded end received by a conical recess in a guide disc.
