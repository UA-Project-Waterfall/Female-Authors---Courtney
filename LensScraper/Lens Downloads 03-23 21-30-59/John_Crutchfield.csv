The systems and methods of the present invention can support the formatting function with hardware formatting logic. This hardware formatting logic can support multiple printhead platforms. The hardware formatting logic of the present invention can perform bit shifting, resolution reduction, bit per pixel reduction, data masking for shingling, and input data sourcing. The present invention can also include a system processor further including an embedded ARM processor which can fetch and execute instructions and/or firmware. These instructions can direct the embedded processor to configure a format block included within the system processor. The format block can be configured by the system processor via one or more control registers.

    The present invention relates generally to systems and methods for assessing blood flow in blood vessels, for assessing vascular health, for conducting clinical trials, for screening therapeutic interventions for adverse effects, and for assessing the effects of risk factors, therapies and substances, including therapeutic substances, on blood vessels, especially cerebral blood vessels, all achieved by measuring various parameters of blood flow in one or more vessels and analyzing the results in a defined matter. The relevant parameters of blood flow include mean flow velocity, systolic acceleration, and pulsatility index. By measuring and analyzing these parameters, one can ascertain the vascular health of a particular vessel, multiple vessels and an individual. Such measurements can also determine whether a substance has an effect, either deleterious or advantageous, on vascular health. In one of many embodiments, the present invention further provides an expert system for achieving the above.

    The present invention relates generally to systems and methods for assessing blood flow in blood vessels, for assessing vascular health, for conducting clinical trials, for screening therapeutic interventions for adverse effects, and for assessing the effects of risk factors, therapies and substances, including therapeutic substances, on blood vessels, especially cerebral blood vessels, all achieved by measuring various parameters of blood flow in one or more vessels and analyzing the results in a defined matter. The relevant parameters of blood flow include mean flow velocity, systolic acceleration, and pulsatility index. By measuring and analyzing these parameters, one can ascertain the vascular health of a particular vessel, multiple vessels and an individual. Such measurements can also determine whether a substance has an effect, either deleterious or advantageous, on vascular health.

    An improved signal converter is provided to interface between an IEEE 1284 (parallel) bus or device and an IEEE 1394 (serial) bus or device. The converter in its preferred embodiment is designed for use with printers, in which the printer communicates with the converter through either the converter's 1284 port or its 1394 port. In one system, the converter acts as a 1284-to-1394 converter to interface between a printer (on the 1394 port) and a host computer (on the 1284 port). In a second system, the converter acts as a peer-to-peer 1394-to-1284 converter to interface between a printer (on the 1284 port) and some type of 1394 compliant device (on the 1394 port), such as a digital camera. The converter includes a Link layer that is embedded within an ASIC, which preferably includes a microcontroller or a logic state machine, to facilitate asynchronous data transfer. The ASIC acts as an interpreter between the 1284 bus and the microcontroller interface of the Link layer, and is responsible for mode negotiation and mode operation as defined in the IEEE 1284 standard. In the 1284-to-1394 converter mode of operation, the converter provides a 1284 controller in a slave mode, thereby allowing the 1394 side of the microcontroller to act as the controlling master of the converter system. In the peer-to-peer 1394-to-1284 converter mode of operation, the converter provides a 1284 controller which operates as a master for the printer's slave controller, thereby initiating and controlling the flow of data on the 1284 interface. Since the converter is the master of the 1284 interface, it is also responsible for reading the alerts from the printer, once the printer is armed to provide such alerts.

The electrical system also provides for the headlights and taillights to be deactivated once the ignition switch is off. At least one relay is placed between the windshield wiper switch and the headlights and taillights. A current entering the relays from the initiation of the windshield wiper switch, induces a magnetic field across the inductor, closing the switches within the relays, thus illuminating the lights. If two relays are used, then the second relay maintains the activation of the headlights and taillights if the windshield wiper switch is deactivated.

An isolation circuit is coupled to the first cell, the second cell and the low power circuit to maintain a current isolation between the first cell and the second cell at least during delivery currents having a large magnitude that are delivered to the high power output circuit.",MEDTRONIC INC,CRUTCHFIELD RANDOLPH E;;BOONE MARK R;;CABELKA LONNY V;;KUEHN KEVIN P;;MEADOR JOHN T;;NORTON JOHN D;;SCHMIDT CRAIG L,MEDTRONIC INC (2015-04-16),https://lens.org/083-680-046-011-702,Patent Application,yes,2,8,5,10,0,A61N1/378;;A61N1/3931;;A61N1/3782;;A61N1/3981;;A61N1/3975;;A61N1/3956;;A61N1/378;;A61N1/3931;;A61N1/3782;;A61N1/3981,A61N1/39,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
