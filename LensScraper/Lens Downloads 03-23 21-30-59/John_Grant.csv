   Simply stated, the Brake NOW helmet mounted brake light represents a breakthrough in rider safety by effectively alerting drivers behind them of their intentions to slow down or stop. The simple concept of putting a highly visible LED brake light directly on the rider's helmet has never been addressed before. 

   New laws have been passed requiring helmets to be worn while riding on public streets. Helmet manufacturers have gone to great lengths to make their product more impact resistant. They have also added unique paint and color schemes to make their helmets more visible. Nothing, however, comes close to the degree of safety that the Brake NOW warning light affords. 

    Working exactly on the same theory that now makes it mandatory for automobile manufacturers to have a higher mounted, 3 ^{rd} brake light in every car and truckthe Brake NOW helmet mounted brake light accomplishes the same recognizable effect. Being seen equates to being safer

Grant, J. C. Feb. 4, 1918. Machines with two sets of types for coding and decoding. -A typewriter for printing code and original messages simultaneously is provided with two distinct sets of typewheels or shuttles which receive equal angular and equal axial movements at each key operation, one set being non- adjustable and the other set being adjustable in accordance with a code number. The adjustable type-wheels may be formed with a number of splines or castellations for engaging splines or castellations on the shaft. In the arrangement shown, anvils H, H<2> on a shaft C carry a set of four adjustable shuttles B<1> - - B<4> and a single non-adjustable shuttle A respectively. The shuttle A is provided with four rows of types arranged with like letters superposed. The shuttles B<1> - - B<4> have each one row of types with nine or more letters repeated at the ends to provide a sufficient range for the code. Before coding or decoding, the anvils are detached and the shuttles B<1> - - B<4> are set relatively forwards or backwards in accordance with the code number, and are then secured together and again coupled to the stop arm D of the action. Each of the shuttles is formed with a number of lettered or numbered holes b<2>, Fig. 3, for engaging a fork which secures the shuttles together. The stop arm D is formed with a finger d' which can engage one of a series of notches b<1> on each of the shuttles B<1> - - B<4> The finger d<1> engages also a single notch in the shuttle A. In a modification, the non-adjustable shuttle is mounted in a stationary anvil and bears only one row of type. The shaft C is moved axially at each key-operation in order to bring the shuttles B<1> - - B<4> successively into printing position. For this purpose, the shaft is supported by a cam W, Fig. 8, adapted to raise and then drop the shaft. The cam is provided with a ratchetwheel T engaging a detent Z and an operating pawl S on the shift-lever L<1>. The character-key levers may operate a universal bar on the lever L'. According to the Provisional Specification, the type-members may be successively moved into position by a spring or weight or by compressed air, a bell or buzzer being provided for indicating when the code figure has been completed; further, the type-wheels may be locked by a nut engaging a bayonet thread on the shaft.

Trimming type ; moulds.-Type-casting moulds of the kind described in Specification 20,953/00, are constructed to produce "" self-dressed "" types v, such as are shown in Figs. 10, 11, and 12, the tangs o being so placed that, when broken off the types v, the rupture takes place towards one side of the type, and within the body of the type. The mould shown in Figs. 1, 2, and 5 for producing the type shown in Fig. 10 is formed from blocks a, b, c, d, spaced apart to receive an adjustable slide f, which determines the set width of the type, and is of the body shape and size of the type with its tang. The mould is closed by the matrix m and a slide l, a shielded plate e being provided to receive the nipple. When the cast has been made, the slide l is withdrawn, and the slide f is raised to carry the type and its tang to the top of the block c, the slide l is then advanced, and the tang o is broken off against a lug p. The slide f is reduced in thickness at the top, and plates q, r are secured to the reduced part so as to produce a slide of the shape of the mould cavity ; or the slide may be reduced on one side to receive a plate, and the other side of the mould may be stepped. The block c may be provided with ridges to produce nicks g in the type, the slide f being grooved to fit the ridges. The type shown in Fig. 11 is produced in a mould wherein the blocks b, d are replaced by a single block formed with a ridge which produces a groove y between the type and the tang, the slide f being formed with a groove which fits the ridge in the block. The type shown in Fig. 12 is produced by a mould such as that used for producing the type shown in Fig. 11, but not having the ridge in the single block. The blocks may be water-cooled.",GRANT JOHN CAMERON,GRANT JOHN CAMERON,,https://lens.org/104-973-226-871-469,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,B41B5/04,B41B5/04,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

This can be combined with the calculated diffusion velocity for the node to produce a rate of change of vorticity with respect to time which can be used to calculate the velocity of the fluid at the node.",US ARMY,GRANT JOHN R,NAVY UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THE AS REPRESENTED BY THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY (1996-05-02),https://lens.org/034-302-517-081-18X,Granted Patent,yes,3,19,1,1,0,G01M9/08;;G01M9/08,G01M9/08,73/147,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The wheel b is loose on the shaft a, to which it may be clutched by means of a lever g. The c o u n t e r may be arranged to register with the engines running in either direction, by connecting a crank driven by the gearing to a longer crank on the counter ; the long crank then only oscillates while the other rotates. A pointer q indicates the speed, and a co-axial pointer 10 revolves so as to indicate the direction of revolution of the shaft a. The mechanism for operating the pointer q consists of bevel-wheels s<1>, s<2>, Fig. 2, rotated in opposite directions by the wheel s, the wheel s<1> being fixed to its shaft t, and the wheel s<2> loose on this shaft. These wheels carry pawls to actuate ratchet - wheels u<1>, u<2>, which are arranged with their teeth in the same direction, so that one wheel is driven white the pawl moves idly over the other.

Grant, A. J., [Haggarty, G. A.]. May 29. Telegraphs, mechanical.-In a ship's telegraph in which the signals are transmitted by rotating a shaft through a certain number of turns in one direction or the :other, a shaft b, Fig. 1, driven by a shaft a can be disconnected from it at will by means of a clutch comprising a sleeve c, which engages the shaft a by an internal thread d and the shaft b by a longitudinal feather. For this purpose, an actuating-sleeve j is moved into the position shown in Fig. 1. The instrument connected to the shaft b may thus be put out of action ; but when the sleeve j is moved to the right, the two shafts automatically engage at the'moment when the instruments connected to them show the same indication. Two levers fare pivoted on the sleeve c at g and carry pivoted locking-pins n, which play through holes in the sleeve. When the clutch is in the disconnecting position, as shown, the levers f are held out against the spring m by toggle-links h pivoted on the actuating-sleeve j when the sleeve j is moved to the right, the springs m cause the pins to press against the shaft a, and as soon as the two shafts are brought to their correct relative position by turning the shaft a, they are locked by the pins n dropping into recesses p in the shaft a. To show when the shafts are in a locking position, or in which direction they differ from it, the end of the sleeve c carries a pointer and the shaft a is marked with a circumferential line and with arrow heads. The togglelinks h have projections which bear on the sleeve j to limit their motion, and one of them has a rounded catch which engages a spring bolt u so as to lock the sleeve j automatically when it is moved into the disconnecting position. According to the Provisional Specification, there may be a second catch to hold the sleeve in its other extreme position.",GRANT ALLAN JOHN,GRANT ALLAN JOHN,,https://lens.org/028-442-396-924-845,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Grant, J. C. April 2. [Cognate Application, 25,031/09.] Single-type composing and casting machines; matrices.-Relates to machines for casting a line of individual type from aline of previously assembled matrices and consists in producing the type at one operation or pouring using character and space matrices having one or more integral mould walls. Fig. 1 shows a character matrix a employed in the machine in which the cavity is impressed upon a prominence 2, and a projection 3 equal in length to the height of the type to be produced is provided upon an attached separate thickness of metal and is employed to act as a wall of the mould cavity. The two parts of the matrix may be constructed of different materials. The shape of the matrix lugs prevents the prominence 2 from being damaged. Two-letter matrices of the type shown in Fig. 1 with a fount-discriminating notch for use with a double magazine, and multiple-letter matrices, all provided with the projections 3, are described, the prominences 2 being sometimes omitted. A single character may extend over adjacent matrices in the same or successive lines ; lines in bordered or tabular matter may similarly be produced. Assembly, justification, casting, and distribution are effected as described below. Assembling matrices.-The matrices are released from magazine channels for de'ivery into the assembly-box, by a key-operated power-relay escapement-mechanism as in the Mergenthaler machine. The escapement-dogs coact with the lugs 5 of the matrices. Fig. 2U shows the assembly box g in its normal positon with the matrices assembled on ledges 212, 221, 213 and with a matrix-arresting lug 210 and star-wheel z<1>. The ledge 221 is supported on pivoted arms 220, which may be thrown forward for providing access to the box. When a line of matrices has been assembled, the box is swung upon the shaft 211 through a right-angle. The matrices are then supported on ledges 213, 214, the ledge 214 being movable by means of a lever 215, and are swept onwards along raceways towards the casting position. Clamping and justifying matrices; spacers; justifying type.-Fig. 3 shows a wedge space-matrix b comprising two parts which are movable apart by a wedge 26, a prominence 22 on one part co-operating with a recess 23 in the other. According to the Provisional Specification, the wedges may move in the direction of the length of the cast type. Ordinary space or quad matrices, similar to the character matrices but with higher prominences 2, are also employed. Four separate methods of line-justification are described. According to the first three methods, as the width of the type is not dependent upon the thickness of the matrix, each matrix is made double or proportionately greater in set-width than it normally would be, and all the wedge space-matrices, unlike the character matrices, have a constant additional width. In the fourth method however, the additional width of character and wedge space-matrices alike is a single constant. This constant is the entire width of the projection 3, which is not the case in the other methods. Figs. 22 and 23 show the mechanism employed for the first method of justification. The wedge space-matrices are released from a magazine 104 by the operation of a key which simultaneously actuates an anchor escapement i and allows a screw j<1> to move a jaw 107 through a distance equal to the constant upon each wedge space-matrix. The parts are hereinafter described in connexion with matrices which are double their normal width, and so the jaw 107 is initially set for a line double the length of the line of type to be cast. When the assembled line nearly attains the proper measure, a special bell-ringing gear h is actuated, and on its completion, the operator moves a starting-handle which rotates the box g to its upper position, as shown in Fig. 22, and actuates the various parts of the machine. The matrices are swept from the box g along raceways 109 over a table k<1>, and the box returns to normal position for the composition of the next line. The motion of the gear j<1> in moving the jaw 107 from its zero position is communicated by a gear j<2> to a measuring vice-jaw 110, but, when the box g returns to normal position, the gear j<1> also returns the jaw 107 without returning the jaw 110. The line of matrices is held between the jaws 110, 111, which are movable transversely into the raceway, and the table k<1> is moved upwards to expand the wedge space-matrices by means of screw-mechanism 251, 253 as shown. A similar table x<1> for justifying the matrices at the mould is simultaneously moved upwards to half the extent of the table k<1>. The wedges of the space-matrices are next pushed down to their normal position by means of a pusher 112, the table k<1> having first been moved down, and the matrices are further swept along between the transversely-movable mould end jaws 115, 116. During this movement, the wedges are moved up by a lever to the level of the table x<1>, upon which they then come to rest. A screw 70, driven through an adjustable connexion 87, 88, is next rotated to close the jaw 116 upon the line of matrices, which are then held in position to cast a line of separate correctly justified type. The jaws 107, 110 can be set for various lengths of line. The jaw 110 returns to a position corresponding to that to which the jaw 107 has moved in the composition of the succeeding line. In the second method of justification, not only the measuring- jaw 110 but the left-hand mould jaw 116 are moved by gearing from the assembly-jaw 107. The right-hand jaws 111, 115 are movable towards the left by means of a wedge action produced by a rising table, the movement of the jaw 115 being half that of the jaw 111. The wedges of the space-matrices are not pushed up to justify the line when it has been moved from the assemblybox, but the line is clamped by the movement of the jaw 111. The line being afterwards conveyed between the mould-jaws 115, 116 which have been set as described, the wedges of the space-matrices are pushed up to produce the correct justification for the casting operation. In the third method of justification, mechanism for which is shown in Fig. 49, the assembly-jaw 160 is fed by a screw 164 and escapement i from its zero position at each release of a wedge space-matrix through a distance equal to the space-matrix constant, the mould-jaw 169 being geared to move through the same distance. When the line is complete, actuation of the starting-handle raises an abutment 162 into the delivery end of the box g, the abutment being either narrow or forked to coact with a double or narrow star-wheel z<2>, and the screws 164, 165 are locked against rotation by a stop 172 engaging a coupling 173, 174. Rotation of a shaft 178 next causes gearing to rotate pinions 58, 59, which operate nuts in the jaws 160, 169 so as to move these jaws, the jaw 169 moving half as far as the jaw 160. The jaw 160 clamps the line of matrices against the abutment 162, and, the assembly-box being then rotated, the coupling 173, 174 is released, the screw 164 moved back to its zero position for a fresh line, the abutment 162 returned, and the completed line swept in front of the mould. The jaws 160, 169 may be moved by means of wedges. The wedges of the spacematrices are then pushed up by the table x<3> to expand the line between the jaws 169, 170 ready for the casting operation. The screw 164 is returned to its zero position by means of gearing 187 from a sector 186 which records the addendum of the space constants. After the cast, the jaw 169 is slackened by means of gearing from a sector 189, and is then allowed to return to a position determined by the sector 186, which corresponds to an addendum of wedge space-matrix constants in the new line being composed. The jaws 160, 169 are now moved to the left through the distance which they were closed to the right during the justification of the preceding line. This brings the jaws themselves to what would be their zero position had they not been moved during the composition of the new line, and is accomplished by re-coupling the parts 173, 174 and rotating the shaft 178 back to its original position. Back-spacing gear zy for the jaws 169, 160, used for example when a wedge space-matrix is removed from the line, may also be employed in the first and second methods of justification. The escapement i is arranged so that it may be driven backwards. A pointer-and-scale device shows the length of the line in the assembly-box. In the fourth method of justification, each key depression, whether for character or space-matrix, causes a movement of the jaw in the assembly-box. When the line is complete it is moved opposite the mould, and the wedges of the space-matrices are elevated to clamp the line between the mould-jaws, the left-hand one of which has been moved simultaneously with the assembly-jaw by a ratchet escapement. In the meantime, the assembly-jaw has been returned to zero position for the new line, and, after the cast, the mould-jaw is returned by special means to a position determined by that of the assembly-jaw. In this method of justification, tLe movable mould-jaw is wide enough to cover that part of the tang orifice which in some cases may not be occupied by matrices. The escapement of the various justification mechanisms is driven through a friction clutch which may be disengaged to allow backward rotition of the escapement. Moulds.-Fig. 26 shows the upper and lower vertically movable mould blocks 113, 114 between which the projections on the matrices and the mould end vice-jaws extend to divide the mould into as many divisions as there are matrices.

Determining and plotting bearings and courses.- Apparatus for use in manoeuvring ships comprises a plotting surface c, surrounded by circular scales a, b, a pivoted radial arm d which sweeps the scales, and a T-shaped cursor y carried by the arm and having two scales e, f marked with equal divisions. For convenience in laying off bearings or courses by the transverse limb of the cursor, the quadrants of the outer scale in which the radial arm must be set are indicated on the plotting table. Thus the N to E and the S to W quadrants are each marked N & W or S & E, and the other two are marked N & E or S & W. To prevent the scale f from being raised from the plotting surface by the central pivot, a spring hinged section g<1> is provided at its centre. The circular scales a, b are mounted so that they can be set in May position. The following illustration is given of the method of using the apparatus. The flag-ship is steaming N. 15‹ W. at 14 knots. The forming ship has a speed of 16 knots and is 6 knots away on the starboard beam of the flap-ship. What course should the forming ship steer to bring her 2 knots in advance of the flag-ship ? (1) Assuming the flag-ship to be at the centre of the board, her course is plotted by turning the radial arm d to a quadrant marked N & W, setting the index b<1> to the 15‹ division of the outer scale b, and drawing a line from the centre of the board along the edge of the plotting scale f. (2) On this line a point D 2 knots from the centre and a point G 14 knots from the centre are marked. (3) The arm d is swung counter -clockwise through an angle of ninety degrees and the present positio P of the forming ship is marked. (4) A line is drawn through G parallel to the line joining D, P, by setting the plotting scale along the line D, P and sliding the cursor the required distance. (5) The cursor is slid out 16 divisions on the scale e. (6) The plotting scale is turned until the zero division lies on the line through the point G. There will be two positions fulfilling these conditions. The correct one is easily determined by inspection.

The fluid diodes may be of the scroll, vane or vortex type. The inlet connection may include a head tank (122) Fig. 3 (not shown), connected to the chamber' by a U-tube (112), and partially filled with liquid e.g. a noxious liquid, below a gas space (123 ), a tank inlet (124) includes the second fluid diode 18. The tank, U-tube and chamber 11 form an oscillatory liquid column whereby the means 15, consisting of a heating element embedded in a cover 14, vapourises liquid in contact with lower surface 16 so causing a pulse which pumps the liquid. The vapourised liquid condenses on expanding away from surface 16, and contacts surface 16 again to give a further pulse, a condenser may be provided to increase the pulse rate. The pulsing means may be electrolytic or mechanical e.g. a piston or it may include an air pulse acting through an intermediate fluid, compatible with the fluid to be pumped, (see Specification 831383). When an intermediate fluid is used this may be separated by a diaphragm from the fluid to be pumped. The pumping arrangement may be incorporated in a system employing four diodes in a manner analoguous to electrical diodes in a full wave A.C. rectifying system Fig.4 (not shown). Alternate positive and negative pulses e.g. air pressure are applied across one pair of terminals (315, 317) and inlet and outlet connections act as the other pair of opposed terminals (212, 213).",ATOMIC ENERGY AUTHORITY UK,GOLDER JACK ALEXANDER;;GRANT JOHN,,https://lens.org/139-245-064-329-144,Granted Patent,no,0,7,1,1,0,F04F1/04,F04F1/04,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Aqueous dispersions of silica particles are made as follows: aqueous silicic acid, having an acid pH, is added to a heated vessel containing a heel comprising a dispersion of silica particles of size greater than 500Š in aqueous alkali metal silicate solution, and water is evaporated, preferably at atmospheric pressure, from the vessel during addition of the acid, which is best added over a period of 7 to 9 hours. The resulting sol comprises particles of disymmetry diameter greater than 500Š. The initial composition of the heel is such that the molar ratio M 2 O (where M is an alkali metal) to overall silica is 1 : 5 to 40. The quantity of aqueous silicic acid is such that the silica particles in the initial heel represent not less than 1 % of the total silica content of the product, and such that the ratio M 2 O: overall SiO 2 in the product is 1 : 50 to 300. Sols containing 20-55% silica by weight may be made by the process described above (which is for sols containing up to 20% SiO 2 ) followed by evaporation to the required concentration.

A hydraulic circuit supplies hydraulic oil to the cylinders, and provides an oil flow path between working ends of the cylinders so as to transfer a slug of pressurized hydraulic oil between the working ends. In one embodiment, reaching movement is controlled by a pump connected to control transferring of the slug between the hoist and stick cylinders. The pump determines which cylinder receives which portion of the slug of oil, and thereby controls the angle between the booms, thereby producing reach.
