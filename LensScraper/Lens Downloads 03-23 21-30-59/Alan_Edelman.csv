   A technique for providing routing of various multimedia events throughout the course of a multimedia presentation using a computer with a storage and a display. A variety of multimedia objects are defined in the storage and grouped in logical relationships to enable multimedia presentations. A display is used to create the presentations interactively by positioning objects representative of the multimedia events and joining them with geometric figures, such as line segments. Each object can then be directly manipulated via a mouse or other pointing device to position a multimedia object to a particular position, or adjust the playback rate of a multimedia object.
