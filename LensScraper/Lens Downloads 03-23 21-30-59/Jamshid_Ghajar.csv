The display presents to the subject multiple stimuli, including a predictable, smoothly moving object, repeatedly moving over a same path. The video cameras sense eye movements of the subject, while the subject visually follows the object on the display. The computer analyzes the subject's eye movements to determine, for example, accuracy and variability of the subject's visual pursuit of the display of the smoothly moving object, and determines, based on the analysis, if the subject has a cognitive impairment. The cognitive impairment may be an anticipatory timing impairment. The analysis may provide one or more metrics, such as a metric of attention, a metric of fatigability and a metric of distractibility.

   A catheter guide for controlling an angle of entry of a catheter into a human cranium at an angle of 90 degrees to the surface and allowing for easy removable of the catheter guide from the catheter after use. A tubular member defines a catheter guide lumen to permit the passage therethrough of a catheter. A base supports the tubular member. In a two piece assembly, the tubular member may have a fracture line allowing the catheter guide to be separated from the catheter. In an integrated, break-away assembly, the catheter guide may be broken apart to allow for the removal of the catheter guide from the catheter. Alternatively, in an integrated assembly or in a two piece assembly, the catheter guide may be removed from a catheter through a slot in the catheter guide.

The guide is inserted therethrough and into the cranial cavity. Subsequently, an elongated tubular member is inserted into the guide, which spreads the flanged tips therof, thus creating an interference fit between the flanges and the inner surface of the cranium. A locking ring, positioned upon the guide above the alignment stand, is utilized to secure the device against the cranium by screwing the ring in the direction of the stand. A method for assembling the device within a burr hole previously prepared in the patient's cranium is additionally disclosed.",NEURODYNAMICS INC,GHAJAR JAMSHID B G;;GHADJAR FATHALI G;;HARIRI ROBERT J,NEURODYNAMICS INC. 400 E. 70 ST.
