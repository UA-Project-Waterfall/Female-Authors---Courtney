Fluid pressure servomotor systems. AUDCO Ltd. Nov. 5, 1964 [Nov.13, 1963], No. 44824/63. Heading G3P. A valve such as a cargo valve in an oil tanker vessel is actuated by a hydraulic servopiston 6, the fig. (not shown) under the control of a valve 7 subject to the opposed forces of springs 8, 9. The spring 8 is compressed by a cam 11 driven by the servopiston and the spring 9 by a bellows 13 subject to the output of a reducing valve 15 with a calibrated handwheel 16 so that any error between the actual position of the servopiston and the desired positions as determined by the pressure applied to the bellows 13 results in a corrective movement by the servopiston. Whenever an error exists a band 19 allows leakage through a variable restriction 17 from the conduit 14 between the valve 15 and bellows 13 and this condition is indicated by a flow responsive device 18. Instead of the band 19 a spring-loaded spool 23 subject to the pressures on the two sides of the servopiston 6 may be provided to vent the conduit 14 in the event of inequality of the pressures. The band 19 or spool 23 may alternatively be arranged to provide the leakage only when no error exists. An alternative indicator arrangement employs a valve 25 which prevents or permits leakage when the servopiston 6 reaches either end of its travel.",AUDCO LTD,FLOYD TERENCE JOHN,,https://lens.org/032-432-087-868-531,Granted Patent,no,0,3,2,2,0,F15B9/08;;F15B9/08,F15B9/08,G3P PPX           PPX;;G3P P14           -;;G3P P16EX         -;;G3P P16E3         -;;G3P P18           -;;G3P P24KX         -;;G3P P5            -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A rodless pump is disclosed which is connected to a pressure source via a first conduit. In a common oilfield application the pump would be connected to the bottom of a tubing string within the reservoir fluid to be produced. A pressure source such as a hydraulic pump would be connected at the surface to the tubing string so as to selectively apply pressure via fluid in the first conduit to the pump, raising the plunger assembly in the pump drawing reservoir fluid into the pump. When pressure via the surface pressure source is released, a balancing fluid, connected to the pump from the surface through a second conduit positioned within the first conduit, urging the plunger assembly downward in the pump urging the reservoir fluid in the pump into the tubing and to the surface. Preferably, the pump includes dampening mechanisms at both the top and bottom of the plunger stroke so as to reduce metal to metal impact within the pump. This dampening mechanism may include but is not limited to elastomer barriers, springs, and other dampening mechanisms such as discussed further within.

Incoming fluid is switched from one filter or pair of filters to another by a pressure-responsive coanda device, and filtered fluid leaving the filter(s) on forward flow is partly diverted in reverse direction through the remaining filter. In Fig. 2, fluid is directed into passage 5 or 6 by pressure and suction transmitted through ducts 28, 29 which open to apertures 30, 31 in a cylinder 32 around which is generated a vortex which automatically switches from one side to the other continuously. In Fig. 1 (not shown), the coanda comprising nozzle (7) responds simply to clogging of one filter to switch flow to the other. Figs. 3 to 7 (not shown) illustrate systems in which two out of three filters are on filtering flow while the third is backwashed. Fig. 4 illustrates a tristable coanda which is controlled as in Fig. 2 by pressure transmitted through ducts (42, 43, 44) which lead to the downstream junction (38). Fig. 5 illustrates how the ducts may open into the cylindrical junction (38) at positions adjacent the main filtrate passages and circumferentially spaced therearound. Figs. 6, 7 illustrate an alternative in which the ducts open on to the flat faces of a triangular sectioned probe in the junction (38).

April 3, 1962 [April 4, 1961], No. 11938/61. Heading F2V. A hollow guide rod 12, Fig. 1, which extends through a valve seat 11 mounts a composite piston 13 around which is a cylinder 14 connected rigidly or by resilient means to an annular closure member 15 with a resilient seal 16; the cylinder 14 is moved to open or close the flow passage through the seat 11 by supplying pressure through passages 17, 18 in the rod 12 to either side of the piston 13. The cylinder is connected by a cable 19 to a position indicator. The piston 13 comprises an upper annulus 20 fixed to the rod 12 below and which are spring washers 21, and an externally tapered member 22 also fixed to the rod 12 and engaging a number of internally tapered segments 23 with external friction material 24 which is urged into contact with the cylinder 14 by the downward thrust of the washers 21. Below the parts 22, 23 is the lower piston portion 25 mounted for slight axial movement on the rod 12. The segments 23 are moved out of engagement with the cylinder by the portion 25 during unseating of the valve, and, due to the tapered surfaces, when pressure is supplied to the upper end of the cylinder to seat the valve. In a modification, the piston embodies upper and lower parts 29, 30, Fig. 2, both secured to the rod 12 and spaced by a sleeve 31; between the portions 29, 30 are balls 32 coacting with a cylinder step 42. An annular piston 34, which is mounted on the portion 29, carries four rods 35 that extend through a cam ring 36; upon raising the ring 36 the balls 32 enter a space below a tapered cam surface 8 on the ring. Each rod 35 has an abutment 37 in an aperture 38 in the lower portion 30. Springs 39 are disposed between the piston 34 and the cam ring 36. When pressure fluid is supplied to the upper end of the cylinder, the piston 34 is depressed, the rods 35 slide through the ring 36 since the latter is received by the balls 32, and the springs 39 are compressed. When the valve seats the springs 39 urge the ring 36 downwardly and the surface 8 forces the balls 32 into the step 42. When pressure fluid is supplied to the other end of the cylinder it also flows into an annular space 41 and raises the piston 34 and hence the ring 36 so that downward movement of the cylinder causes the step 42 to urge the balls inwardly. Steps 42 may be provided at other places in the cylinder so that the valve can be locked intermediate the open and closed positions. In a further modification, the rods 35, Fig. 4, extend through expanders 43 having a conical cam surface; a pair of arcuate members 45 is also provided each having a pair of abutments between which a number of balls are disposed. Each of the members 45 has a bevelled surface 47 that engages the expander 43 so that the members 45 move laterally as the expanders move vertically.",AUDCO LTD,FLOYD TERENCE JOHN,,https://lens.org/158-564-517-841-851,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,F16K31/122,F16K31/122,F2V VW30          VW30;;F2V VW33          VW33,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Headings F2B and F2T. A seal between relatively movable members, e.g. the body 10 and the shank 11 of the plug 12 of a rotary plug valve, comprises a sealing ring 17 of deformable material mounted in, and extending substantially completely across the mouth of, a groove in one of the members and urged into engagement with the other member by means of viscous, flowable material 14 retained in the groove under pressure. The ring 17 may be of P.T.F.E. or nylon impregnated with molybdenum disulphide. The material 14 may be a non-settable bituminous material containing fibrous filling. The groove communicates with a passage 14 provided with a check valve 15. In Figs. 1 and 2 the material 14 is pressurized by a screw plug 18.

    Methods and apparatus are used for triggering and controlling an initial induction period in which a substrate is immersed in an electrochemical bath prior to actual electrochemical processing. This is accomplished by sensing a change in cell potential upon immersion of the substrate or a counter electrode in an electrochemical bath. Appropriate logic then holds the cell potential or current at a fixed value for a defined delay period. After that period ends, the logic allows the cell potential or current to increase to a level where electrochemical processing begins.

The first (701) is a preheater, the second (702) is an alignment and irradiation station and the third (703) is a controlled cooling station. Beneath each station, a vacuum pump (710) capable of drawing ultra-low pressures is provided. The preheater is equipped with upper and lower banks of radiant heaters and reflectors (712). The upper heaters are provided above a quartz window (713) of a chamber (714) constituting the station. The pressure in the preheater is pumped down to that in the alignment and irradiation station prior to opening of the gate valve between them and transfer of the face plate and cathode. At the alignment and irradiation station, further heaters (716) are provided. Those above the face plate and cathode, the face plate being uppermost, are mounted on frames (717) about hinges (718), whereby they can be swung up to clear this station's top quartz window, exposing the face plate to the view of an optical system (719) and a laser (720). Manipulation controls (722) are provided for manipulating the position of the face plate to be in pixel alignment, as measured by the optical system (719), with the cathode. The laser is traversed around frit between the face plate and the emission device to cause the frit to melt into contact with both and freeze off once the laser has traversed further. The cooling station (703) has meanwhile been pumped down and the sealed device is transferred to it. The temperature of the device is allowed to rise very slowly, in order to reduce the risk of thermal cracking to as great an extent as possible.

May 10, 1963 [April 13, 1962], No. 14328/62. Heading F2V. A rotary tapered plug valve is provided with means for feeding lubricant to urge the plug towards the larger end of its seating and means for feeding lubricant to parts of the interengaging surfaces of the plug and seat which are on the downstream side when the valve is closed. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 3, lubricant is fed through a passageway 14 in the spindle and through a passage 17 to a chamber 16 to urge the plug 10 against a spring 9. Lubricant is also fed to radial passages 18 containing non-return valves 19 and, when the valve is closed, lubricant flows past the valve on the downstream side to recesses 20 in the housing, through grooves 21 to recesses 22 and to groove 23 thereby lubricating the surfaces. The grooves 23 are separated by portions 24 which prevent communication between the grooves except when the valve is in the open position. Leakage of fluid on the upstream side acts on the associated non-return valve 19 to prevent flow of lubricant. Nipples 25 may be provided to supply lubricant to the interengaging surfaces. In a modification the non-return valves 18 act in the opposite direction providing the lubricant supply to the chamber 16 from the nipples 25 thus dispensing with the supply in the spindle. In a further modification, Fig. 6, the lubricant is controlled by a valve 33 which is subjected to upstream and downstream pressures through conduits 34, 35. As shown the passage 36 is the upstream side and the valve 33 has been moved to the right to permit flow of lubricant through conduit 38 to supply the interengaging surfaces on the downstream side when the valve is closed. In a further modification the valve 33 is located in the valve plug 10 and controls the lubricant fed from the spindle.",AUDCO LTD,HOYLE EDGAR;;FLOYD TERENCE JOHN,,https://lens.org/163-206-213-305-866,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,F16K5/222,F16K5/22,F2V VD20A         -;;F2V VE1G1         -;;F2V VW35          VW35;;F2V VW42          VW42,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

SOLUTION: A gas such as chemically produced nitrogen not including pollutants, highly filtered air or the like is held in a tank 90 without any pollutants under a pressure of approximately 50-120 psi. The tank 90 is connected to a four-position valve 94 via a conduit 92. At a first position, the gas being pressured in the tank 90 is fed to a conduit 72 and a valve in a conduit 82 connects the conduit 82 to a vacuum generator 96. The gas received at the vacuum generator 96 passes a silencer 97 and a microfilter 99, so that no pollutant is discharged to a clean room.

Jan. 25, 1957, No. 2830/57. Class 143 A recording scale comprises a movable weighing platform, an indicator member movable with the platform and having code perforations therein, a number of independently movable sensing pins for sensing individual perforations, one or two pawls and a permutation disc connected with each sensing pin, and means controlled by the relative positions of the permutation discs for setting a number of printing wheels in accordance with the weight on the platform. As shown, indicator discs 4, 5 (Figs. 1, 5) fixed to shaft 1 and having thereon code perforations 16 relative to price and weight respectively are rotated by vertical movement of the weighing platform 15. On pressing an operating button, a solenoid-controlled latch engages teeth 17 (Fig. 5) to lock the discs (enabling the load to be changed during the subsequent printing cycle) and starts motor 30 (Fig. 1) which rotates the main control shaft 33. A cam 34 (Fig. 4) on shaft 33 rocks shafts 42, 43 (Figs. 4, 7) to move rods 55, 56 away from pawls 44, 45 allowing those pawls whose corresponding sensing pins 19 (Fig. 8) are opposite perforations in discs 4, 5 to move under the influence of springs 52, 52a, into engagement with permutation discs 46, 47. A rod 94 is then rocked about shaft 70 (through linkage from a cam 85 on shaft 33) allowing sectors 69 to rotate bails 61 (one to each group of permutation discs, see Fig. 7) until a pawl 63 on each bail engages aligned code slots 83 on the discs, each of which has rotated under the influence of a spring 81 until stopped by the end 57 of a pawl 44 or by a stop 78. Sectors 73, rigidly attached to sectors 69, set printing wheels 21, to record the price of the article on the scale. Similarly wheels 22 (Fig. 7) are set to record the weight. Wheels 23 record the price per pound and are moved as described below, only when the price of goods weighed is changed. A platen 140 (Fig. 10) pivoted at 132 and carrying a paper strip S and inking ribbon R, is stamped on to the printing wheels by links controlled by cams on shaft 33. Changing price disc. Disc 4 carries perforations for one price only. To change the disc, arm 107 (Fig. 5) is moved downwards, this causing a frame 114 pivoted on shaft 77 to move downwards into the position shown in Fig. 10, where three wheels 116 mounted on concentric shafts are in position to engage segements 73. Wheels 115 on the shafts of wheels 116 engage wheels 118 fixed to printing wheels 23 (Fig. 7). On the downward motion of frame 114, wheels 23 are zeroed by springs 1151 and during the next printing cycle, with no weight on the scale pan, the wheels are set by code perforations on the new disc 4, after which an arm 123 of the paper feed mechanism strikes a pin 129 and allows frame 114 to move upwards under the influence of a spring 122 until gears 115 engage a latch 119, thus locking wheels 23 in their new position.",A KIMBALL CO,DRILLICK JOHN H;;ARONSON THEODORE F;;FLOYD WILLIAM B;;LYON FLOYD A;;HALAHAN JOHN,,https://lens.org/133-170-150-610-141,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G01G23/18,G01G23/18,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In the absence of the supplemental system, the occupant restraint controller operates in a default mode wherein the air bag module is enabled. Coupling the supplemental system to the base system permits the air bag module to be selectively disabled. The supplemental system transmits a plurality of signals to indicate whether the air bag module is to be disabled or enabled. When the occupant restraint controller receives a signal indicating that the air bag module is to be disabled, the occupant restraint controller inhibits the generation of squib pulses which would cause the air bag module to actuate.

    The apparatus for sealing face plates (  753  ) and cathodes (  754  ) has three stations (  701, 702, 703  ). The first (  701  ) is a preheater, the second (  702  ) is an alignment and irradiation station and the third (  703  ) is a controlled cooling station. Beneath each station, a vacuum pump (  710  ) capable of drawing ultralow pressures is provided. The preheater is equipped with upper and lower banks of radiant heaters and reflectors (  712  ). The upper heaters are Provided above a quartz: window (  713  ) of a chamber (  714  ) constituting the station. The pressure in the preheater is pumped down to that in the alignment and irradiation station prior to opening of the gate valve between them and transfer of the face plate and cathode. At the alignment and irradiation station, further heaters (  716  ) are provided. Those above the face plate and cathode, the face plate being uppermost, are mounted on frames (  717  ) about hinges (  718  ), whereby they can be swung up to clear this station's top quartz window, exposing the face plate to the view of an optical system (  719  ) and a laser (  720  ). Manipulation controls (  722  ) are provided for manipulating the position of the face plate to be pixel alignment, as measured by the optical system (  719  ), with the cathode. The laser is traversed around further. The cooling station (  703  ) has meanwhile been pumped down and the sealed device is transferred to it. The temperature of the device is allowed to rise very slowly, in order to reduce the risk of thermal cracking to as great an extent as possible. As the temperature slowly falls, air is slowly introduced, so that the finished device can be removed to the ambient surroundings.

    A system for inspecting a surface of a beam covered by at least one structure. The system includes at least one nut clip attached to the beam used to couple the structure to the beam, and at least one spacer inserted between the beam and the structure for creating a gap between the structure and the beam. A micro fiber-optic borescope is used to view the surface of the beam covered by the structure without removing the structure. The surface is viewed by inserting a micro fiber-optic thread of the borescope into the gap. The system eliminates the need for costly and time consuming disassembly and removal of components mounted on the structure before an inspection of the condition of the beam can be made.

   A system for inspecting a surface of a beam covered by at least one structure. The system includes at least one nut clip attached to the beam used to couple the structure to the beam, and at least one spacer inserted between the beam and the structure for creating a gap between the structure and the beam. A micro fiber-optic borescope is used to view the surface of the beam covered by the structure without removing the structure. The surface is viewed by inserting a micro fiber-optic thread of the borescope into the gap. The system eliminates the need for costly and time consuming disassembly and removal of components mounted on the structure before an inspection of the condition of the beam can be made.

    A vehicle occupant restraint system having a base system and a supplemental system is provided. The base system includes an air bag module and an occupant restraint controller. In the absence of the supplemental system, the occupant restraint controller operates in a default mode wherein the air bag module is enabled. Coupling the supplemental system to the base system permits the air bag module to be selectively disabled. The supplemental system transmits a plurality of signals to indicate whether the air bag module is to be disabled or enabled. When the occupant restraint controller receives a signal indicating that the air bag module is to be disabled, the occupant restraint controller inhibits the generation of squib pulses which would cause the air bag module to actuate.

The source material is fed to the reactor together with additional reductant and with flux at or adjacent the at least one reducing region so as to be subjected to smelting reduction, using coal as the additional reductant. The rates of injection of oxygen and fuel/reductant are controlled to achieve required and sufficient reducing conditions by providing the injected gas with an oxygen content from about 40% to about 100% sufficient for a degree of combustion of the fuel/reductant of from about 40% to about 50%. The CO and H2 generated by the smelting operation, as well as carbon dust carried out of the bath by combustion gases, are subjected to post-combustion in the reactor, enabling efficient heating of the bath while preventing re-oxidization of the bath contents.",AUSMELT LTD,FLOYD JOHN;;CHARD IAN;;BALDOCK BRIAN,,https://lens.org/198-153-472-875-971,Granted Patent,no,0,0,22,24,0,C21B13/0026;;Y02P10/134;;C21B13/0026;;Y10S75/961;;Y10S75/957;;Y10S75/962;;Y02P10/134,C21B11/08;;C21B11/00;;C21B13/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The first (701) is a preheater, the second (702) is an alignment and irradiation station and the third (703) is a controlled cooling station. Beneath each station, a vacuum pump (710) capable of drawing ultra-low pressures is provided. The preheater is equipped with upper and lower banks of radiant heaters and reflectors (712). The upper heaters are provided above a quartz window (713) of a chamber (714) constituting the station. The pressure in the preheater is pumped down to that in the alignment and irradiation station prior to opening of the gate valve between them and transfer of the face plate and cathode. At the alignment and irradiation station, further heaters (716) are provided. Those above the face plate and cathode, the face plate being uppermost, are mounted on frames (717) about hinges (718), whereby they can be swung up to clear this station's top quartz window, exposing the face plate to the view of an optical system (719) and a laser (720). Manipulation controls (722) are provided for manipulating the position of the face plate to be in pixel alignment, as measured by the optical system (719), with the cathode. The laser is traversed around frit between the face plate and the emission device to cause the frit to melt into contact with both and freeze off once the laser has traversed further.

Pulse discriminating circuits; pulse radar; transponder apparatus. COLLINS RADIO CO. Feb. 26, 1962, No. 7447/62. Headings H3D, H4L and H4P. Relates to a circuit not affording an output pulse when an input pulse, of a train of pulses arising from transmission from an omnidirectional aerial ("" control "" pulse) and from a directional aerial (one or more "" trigger "" pulses), arrives from a side lobe of the directional aerial. According to the invention the circuit comprises delay means 22 affording a delay by a predetermined interval which is equal to the pulse spacing in a two-pulse system and which is equal to the spacing between the two directionally-radiated pulses in a three-pulse system, comparator means 26 fed from the delay means and fed with substantially undelayed circuitinput signals, and coincidence means 33 fed with the difference-output of the comparator means and fed with the output of the delay means whereby an output from the comparator means is precluded whenever the received signal includes a radiated pulse from a side lobe. In the embodiment, as applied to the reception of a control pulse followed by a trigger pulse, the received pulse train, Fig. 3a, is applied to a set of delay lines in cascade 22, Fig. 2, a delayed and pulse-stretched train, Fig. 3e, of adjustable amplitude appearing at the output of diode 44 for application to one input of a differential amplifier 26 to the other input of which there is applied, via a "" spike eliminator "" 31 and a cathode follower 30, the pulse train, Fig. 3d; the differential amplifier output is as shown in Fig. 3f and is applied to coincidence circuit 33 to the other input of which is applied the train, Fig. 3c, formed from the input, Fig. 3a, delayed by the inter-pulse interval. The coincidence circuit produces an output pulse, Fig. 3g, since there are simultaneous positive-going portions at the inputs thereto ; the output pulse initiates coded transponding. Fig. 1 (not shown). Fig. 4, a . . . g, shows that when the trigger pulse is of lower amplitude, due to side-lobe radiation, there is no output pulse. The circuit operation is explained when the input pulse train comprises (1) a control pulse followed by a pair of trigger pulses, Figs. 5 and 6 (neither shown), and (2) a control pulse between two trigger pulses, Figs. 7 and 8 (neither shown); in the latter case the network 28, the input to which is delayed, relative to the circuit input, by an interval equal to the interval between the control pulse and the adjacent trigger pulse plus the duration of the control pulse, is also coupled to differential amplifier 26.",COLLINS RADIO CO,MAJERUS JOHN BRUCE;;TOTTEN FLOYD MERVIN,,https://lens.org/049-526-322-566-125,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G01S13/762,G01S13/76,H3P PRX           PRX(V);;H4D D34X          R;;H4D D369          R;;H4D D418          R;;H4L LAAB          LAAB;;H4L LG            NONE;;H4L LGC           NONE,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The washer is provided with a central aperture within which is disposed a teflon pin that extends from the transducer to just short of the upper washer surface. Carried by the plate and extending upwardly is a displacement rod which terminates in an optical end portion that includes a narrow lengthwise slit therein. On opposite sides of the slit there is positioned a source of illumination and a photo-detector response to the quantities of light emanating from the source. Thus as the rod is depressed by the activation of the squib a quantity of light proportional to the displacement impinges on the detector whose output is applied to one channel of an oscilloscope. The squib is fired by a linear constant current pulse which is also applied to the scope. The downward movement of the squib piston initially compresses the washer while transmitting the force to the transducer and after this limited movement the pin provides for the force transmission. The transducer under displacement provides an electrical signal to the oscilloscope proportional to the force acting thereon.

The first voltage VFB corresponds to the output current of the regulator. The second voltage is an independently generated modulated reference voltage VREF. A clock signal causes the regulator to enter a charging phase. That phase is maintained until VREF no longer exceeds VFB. At that point, a discharge phase is initiated.

   A method and architecture for calculating input values for use in automated analysis and design during the various stages of the design process includes smart defaults. Specific parameter types are defined, some of which are adapted to be specified, or if not specified, calculated by the smart defaults. A tree structure is provided for determining parameter relationships in order to calculate parameter values. The tree structure uses a specific routine to call a smart default each time a parameter value is to be determined, and values are thereby calculated independent of the order of the data inputs.

The method can facilitate sintering in a low temperature range (equal to or lower than 300 DEG C) to yield > 90% densification without the need for additional post-treatment steps, otherwise requiring additional post-treatment steps if conventional methods are used. Controlling the pressure and water content used during the process can enhance the densification mechanism associated with dissolution-reprecipitation, thereby allowing a larger range of composition lineages of densifiable materials, reducing the amount of transport phase required, reducing impurities, and improving the properties of densified materials.

The sensors may e.g. detect movement to turn lights on or off, or detect ambient light levels to adjust lighting to e.g. maintain incident light on a desktop at a constant level. The power supply 42 includes photosensitive cells 2 (operating either in photovoltaic of photoamperic states), which receive ambient light 6 from sources 8. The cell output charges a capacitor 12 via a diode 13, which also acts as a charging current sensor by having its forward voltage drop V supplied to a microprocessor 18. The microprocessor 18 determines from the sensed current, the charge on the capacitor 12 and the average rate at which the capacitor increases its charge under ambient light. Using this data and knowledge of the amount of charge needed to transmit a message, the processor varies the transmission, either in terms of the number of messages transmitted in a given time, or the data transmission rate.

The method of bum-in testing a logical group of modules rotates a test sequence, including passive and active test cycles, between the modules. A test signal is split and supplied to multiple modules. Passive testing may be performed by monitoring parameters of the module while the test signal is supplied to the module. Active testing may be a functional test of the module in which the test signal is supplied to, processed by, and output from the module. Such test signals output from the modules are switched to the test equipment on a time-share basis. In this way, the number or expensive test equipment set-ups may reduced. The controller for each virtual oven also generates displays so that a user can track the test progress of all modules within the virtual oven. The controller also builds a database of the active and passive tests for each module. A graphical user interface may be used to interact with the virtual oven, control the testing, and view the database.

   A virtual oven efficiently conducts stress testing of large numbers of modules. The virtual oven includes a logical grouping of modules, a controller, test instruments and a database which are all connected via a network. The logical groupings of modules of several virtual ovens may be physically accommodated within a single environmental stress screening room. Switching between modules in a logical group permits a single test piece of test equipment to be time-shared among the modules in the logical group. The method of bum-in testing a logical group of modules rotates a test sequence, including passive and active test cycles, between the modules. A test signal is split and supplied to multiple modules. Passive testing may be performed by monitoring parameters of the module while the test signal is supplied to the module. Active testing may be a functional test of the module in which the test signal is supplied to, processed by, and output from the module. Such test signals output from the modules are switched to the test equipment on a time-share basis. In this way, the number or expensive test equipment set-ups may reduced. The controller for each virtual oven also generates displays so that a user can track the test progress of all modules within the virtual oven. The controller also builds a database of the active and passive tests for each module. A graphical user interface may be used to interact with the virtual oven, control the testing, and view the database.

The source material is fed to the reactor together with additional reductant and with flux at or adjacent the at least one reducing region so as to be subjected to smelting reduction, using coal as the additional reductant. The rates of injection of oxygen and fuel/reductant are controlled to achieve required and sufficient reducing conditions by providing the injected gas with an oxygen content from about 40% to about 100% sufficient for a degree of combustion of the fuel/reductant of from about 40% to about 50%. The CO and H2 generated by the smelting operation, as well as carbon dust carried out of the bath by combustion gases, are subjected to post-combustion in the reactor, enabling efficient heating of the bath while preventing re-oxidization of the bath contents.",AUSMELT LTD,FLOYD JOHN M;;CHARD IAN L;;BALDOCK BRIAN R,,https://lens.org/180-910-414-722-004,Granted Patent,no,0,0,22,24,0,C21B13/0026;;Y02P10/134;;C21B13/0026;;Y10S75/961;;Y10S75/957;;Y10S75/962;;Y02P10/134,C21B11/00;;C21B13/00;;C21B11/08,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A collision sensor (12) is formed by a bladder (30) attached to a component of the apparatus and deformation of the bladder produces a change in the pressure of air within the bladder (30). The bladder has an air vent (46) to the atmosphere which can be sealed by operation of a valve (44). A pressure sensor (40) produces two control signals when the pressure within the bladder (30) exceeds first and second threshold levels respectively. The second threshold level is greater in magnitude than said first threshold level. The first control signal closes the valve (44) and causes a motor control circuit (66) to discontinue any application of electricity to the motor. The second control signal opens a switch (64) through which electricity normally flows to the motor. A mechanism also is provided to simulate a collision by compressing the bladder (30) to test the operation of the detection system.,GEN ELECTRIC,GRAY FLOYD LEE;;FILTZ DUANE ANTHONY;;GILLING CHRISTOPHER JOHN,,https://lens.org/092-972-715-528-751,Patent Application,yes,4,0,7,7,0,A61B6/102;;A61B6/102,A61B6/10;;G01L5/00;;G01P15/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The source material is fed to the reactor together with additional reductant and with flux at or adjacent the at least one reducing region so as to be subjected to smelting reduction, using coal as the additional reductant. The rates of injection of oxygen and fuel/reductant are controlled to achieve required and sufficient reducing conditions by providing the injected gas with an oxygen content from about 40% to about 100% sufficient for a degree of combustion of the fuel/reductant of from about 40% to about 50%. The CO and H2 generated by the smelting operation, as well as carbon dust carried out of the bath by combustion gases, are subjected to post-combustion in the reactor, enabling efficient heating of the bath while preventing re-oxidization of the bath contents.",AUSMELT LTD,FLOYD JOHN MILLICE;;CHARD IAN LEONARD;;BALDOCK BRIAN ROSS,AUSMELT LIMITED (1997-05-28);;AUSMELT PTY.

The source material is fed to the reactor together with additional reductant and with flux at or adjacent the at least one reducing region so as to be subjected to smelting reduction, using coal as the additional reductant. The rates of injection of oxygen and fuel/reductant are controlled to achieve required and sufficient reducing conditions by providing the injected gas with an oxygen content from about 40% to about 100% sufficient for a degree of combustion of the fuel/reductant of from about 40% to about 50%. The CO and H2 generated by the smelting operation, as well as carbon dust carried out of the bath by combustion gases, are subjected to post-combustion in the reactor, enabling efficient heating of the bath while preventing re-oxidization of the bath contents.",AUSMELT PTY LTD,FLOYD JOHN MILLICE;;CHARD LAN LEONARD;;BALDOCK BRIAN ROSS,,https://lens.org/173-892-568-892-639,Patent Application,no,0,5,22,24,0,C21B13/0026;;Y02P10/134;;C21B13/0026;;Y10S75/961;;Y10S75/957;;Y10S75/962;;Y02P10/134,C21B11/08;;C21B11/00;;C21B13/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The meter (10) has a storage register (26) for a current or old I/O configuration number (IOCN), and can receive a desired new IOCN via keyboard (14) entry. The meter (10) calculates an encrypted I/O configuration request code that depends on the new IOCN. The I/O configuration request code, when communicated to a data center computer (25) along with other validating identification information, is checked by the data center computer (25) which computes the I/O configuration request code using the same algorithm.

GULF & WESTERN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS CO. 19 June, 1970 [19 June, 1969], No. 29871/70. Heading B7G. [Also in Division F2] A rotary hydraulic energy absorber, particularly for arresting landing aircraft A, has a casing J to which are fixed non-rotary stators 30 forming stator pockets which interact with rotor vanes 32 rotatably attached to shafts 34 fixed to a shaft 26 coupled to reels E, around which are located cables H for engaging the aircraft, the vanes 32 being automatically adjustable to provide a constantly retarding torque with decreasing reel speed. To provide adjustment of vanes 32 a ring member M is positioned to slidably receive in guide channels 38 followers 35 secured to the vanes, rods 44 attached to pistons 42, Fig. 4 (not shown), of hydraulically connected cylinders N being fastened to the member M. Pistons 42 are spring- biased and are held in their uppermost positions in which vanes 32 are parallel to the plane of ring M to provide minimum retardation by hydraulic pressure passed through a line 60 from a master cylinder S coupled through a rod 56, a cam R, reduction gearing P and bevel gear 52, 54 to shaft 26. Cam R rotates once during each arrestment cycle so that at its commencement rod 56 causes master cylinder S to supply fluid to cylinders N to maintain minimum retarding torque, but as the cam rotates the fluid pressure in cylinder N decreases and the vanes 32 rotate to increase the torque. A plurality of interconnected master cylinders S may be provided bolted to baffles T, Fig. 3 (not shown), which are moved into any desired position in the pocket by operation of a valve (76) in the line connecting the master cylinders to adjust the depth of the pockets so that the absorber may be preset for a predetermined aircraft weight. The reel E may be reset by a motor K and a one-way clutch (82) provided so that no torque is transmitted to shaft 26 during resetting. In another embodiment the rotor vanes 32 automatically assume the maximum retardation position on loss of hydraulic pressure to the adjustment device by providing a second cylinder hydraulically coupled to cylinder N.",GULF WESTERN IND PRODUCTS COMP,NIEMKIEWICZ IGNATIUS JOHN;;REINEMUTH GEORGE HORST;;SILVER FLOYD GERENON,,https://lens.org/057-486-812-167-297,Granted Patent,no,0,4,5,5,0,B64F1/029;;B64F1/029,B64F1/02;;F16D57/04,B7G G7B1          G7;;B7G G7B3          G7;;F2E E1B           E1B;;F2S SBG           SBG;;F2S S205          SBG;;F2S S308          SBG,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

No. WO93/06251 PCT Pub.

The source material is fed to the reactor together with additional reductant and with flux at or adjacent the at least one reducing region so as to be subjected to smelting reduction, using coal as the additional reductant. The rates of injection of oxygen and fuel/reductant are controlled to achieve required and sufficient reducing conditions by providing the injected gas with an oxygen content from about 40% to about 100% sufficient for a degree of combustion of the fuel/reductant of from about 40% to about 50%. The CO and H2 generated by the smelting operation, as well as carbon dust carried out of the bath by combustion gases, are subjected to post-combustion in the reactor, enabling efficient heating of the bath while preventing re-oxidization of the bath contents.",AUSMELT LTD,FLOYD JOHN MILLICE;;CHARD IAN LEONARD;;BALDOCK BRIAN ROSS,,https://lens.org/136-678-093-211-123,Granted Patent,no,0,0,22,24,0,C21B13/0026;;Y02P10/134;;C21B13/0026;;Y10S75/961;;Y10S75/957;;Y10S75/962;;Y02P10/134,C21B11/00;;C21B13/00;;C21B11/08,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The technique is readily implemented in the meter software. During this technique, the meter is manually set by a Post Office Clerk by putting the meter into a post office mode by pressing selected keys, entering the desired amount of postage, and exiting the mode (30). After exiting the mode, the meter is capable of printing postage. After printing some non-zero postage (32), the customer notifys a data center computer of the manual setting by performing an emergency clear procedure (34). First, the customer puts the meter into a remote setting mode by pressing selected keys (36). In this mode, the meter will generate and display an emergency request code. The customer passes the emergency request code with other identifying information to the data center computer. The computer generates its own emergency request code and compares the codes. If they are equal, then the computer will communicate an emergency enable code to the customer for entry into the meter. Upon confirmation against an internally generated emergency enable code, the meter will enable itself to be remotely set again.

The meter (10) is capable of being put into a configuration mode by suitable entries from the keyboard (14), in which mode it is inhibited from printing postage. The meter (10) has a storage register (26) for a current or old meter type, and can receive a desired new meter type via keyboard (14) entry. The meter (10) generates an encrypted configuration request code that is partially based on the values of the old and new meter types. The configuration request code, when communicated to the data center computer along with other validating identification information, is checked by the data center computer which generates the configuration request code using the same algorithm. 
If the two values agree, the data center computer generates an encrypted configuration enable code. This is communicated to the meter (10), which receives the computer generated configuration enable code and also generates an internal configuration enable code using the same algorithm as the data center computer. If the configuration enable codes agree, the meter (10) overwrites the old meter type number with the new meter type number, thereby reconfiguring the meter (10).",ALCATEL SATMAM,"HAINES, JOHN GREGORY;;SLAUGHTER, TRACY FLOYD;;BARKER, CHARLES PHILIP",NEOPOST INDUSTRIE (1993-04-14),https://lens.org/007-919-843-154-349,Search Report,yes,7,0,6,24,0,G07B17/0008;;G07B17/00733;;G07B2017/00161;;G07B2017/00169;;G07B2017/00419;;G07B2017/0083;;G07B2017/00935;;G07F7/1016;;G07F7/1016;;G07B2017/00419;;G07B2017/00161;;G07B2017/00169;;G07B2017/00935;;G07B17/0008;;G07B17/00733;;G07B2017/0083,G07B17/00;;G07F7/10,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The technique provides security so that the meter company will always have a correct record of the configuration of the meter (10) in the field. The meter (10) is capable of being put into a configuration mode by suitable entries from the keyboard (14), in which mode it is inhibited from printing postage. The meter (10) has a storage register (26) for a current or old meter type, and can receive a desired new meter type via keyboard (14) entry. The meter (10) generates an encrypted configuration request code that is partially based on the values of the old and new meter types. The configuration request code, when communicated to the data center computer along with other validating identification information, is checked by the data center computer which generates the configuration request code using the same algorithm. 
If the two values agree, the data center computer generates an encrypted configuration enable code. This is communicated to the meter (10), which receives the computer generated configuration enable code and also generates an internal configuration enable code using the same algorithm as the data center computer. If the configuration enable codes agree, the meter (10) overwrites the old meter type number with the new meter type number, thereby reconfiguring the meter (10).",ALCATEL SATMAM,HAINES JOHN GREGORY;;SLAUGHTER TRACY FLOYD;;BARKER CHARLES PHILIP,NEOPOST INDUSTRIE (1993-04-14),https://lens.org/114-080-537-862-919,Patent Application,yes,0,9,6,24,0,G07B17/0008;;G07B17/00733;;G07B2017/00161;;G07B2017/00169;;G07B2017/00419;;G07B2017/0083;;G07B2017/00935;;G07F7/1016;;G07F7/1016;;G07B2017/00419;;G07B2017/00161;;G07B2017/00169;;G07B2017/00935;;G07B17/0008;;G07B17/00733;;G07B2017/0083,G07B17/00;;G07F7/10,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A receiver (10) processes radio-frequency sum (S) and difference (D) signals derived from the aerial to produce corresponding intermediate frequency sum (S<1>) and difference (D<1>) signals. The oscillator (62) of a phase-locked loop (60) locks on to the frequency of the intermediate frequency sum signal (S<1>), and a phase-sensitive detector (34) compares the oscillator (62) output with the intermediate frequency difference signal (D<1>) to produce an output signal representing the direction of a target relative to the aerial. The phase-locked loop includes a variable gain circuit (300). Responsive to the intermediate frequency sum signal (S<1>), a threshold detector (304) produces a first or second output signal. The first threshold output signal is combined with a target acquisition signal to cause the variable gain circuit (300) to slowly decrease the bandwidth of the phase-locked loop (60). The second threshold output signal causes the variable gain circuit (300) to rapidly increase the bandwidth of the phase-locked loop (60). The invention is particularly concerned with the use of sidebands added to the narrowband oscillator (62) output to simulate the sidebands in the wideband sum signal I.F. As shown the narrow band intermediate frequency sum signal from oscillator 62 is combined at 605 within the first phase locked loop with a proportion of the output of a second wide band phase locked loop 600-603 to provide pseudo sidebands of constant amplitude. <IMAGE>",MARCONI GEC LTD,ATTWOOD JOHN WILLIAM;;JONES MICHAEL ARTHUR;;FLOYD JOHN THOMAS;;MITCHELL ALAN JAMES,,https://lens.org/074-201-198-613-182,Patent Application,no,0,2,26,26,0,G01S13/4436;;G01S13/4445;;G01S13/4454;;G01S13/68;;G01S13/685,G01S13/44;;G01S13/68,H4D DRPF          RPF;;H4D DSPB          SPB;;H4D D251          RPF;;H4D D251          SPB;;H4D D265          RPF;;H4D D265          SPB;;H4D D507          RPF;;H4D D507          SPB;;H4D D512          RPF;;H4D D512          SPB;;U1S S1839,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A receiver (10) processes radio-frequency sum (S) and difference (D) signals derived from the aerial to produce corresponding intermediate frequency sum (S<1>) and difference (D<1>) signals. The oscillator (62) of a phase-locked loop (60) locks on to the frequency of the intermediate frequency sum signal (5<1>), and a phase-sensitive detector (34) compares the oscillator (62) output with the intermediate frequency difference signal (D<1>) to produce an output signal representing the direction of a target relative to the aerial. The phase-locked loop includes a variable gain circuit (300). Responsive to the intermediate frequency sum signal (S<1>), a threshold detector (304) produces a first or second output signal. The first threshold output signal is combined with a target acquisition signal to cause the variable gain circuit (300) to slowly decrease the bandwidth of the phase-locked loop (60). The second threshold output signal causes the variable gain circuit (300) to rapidly increase the bandwidth of the phase-locked loop (60). The invention is particularly concerned with modification of the oscillator (62) output signal by the addition of pseudo sidebands to reduce the variation in scaling which otherwise occurs. As shown the narrow band intermediate frequency sum signal from oscillator 62 is combined at 604 with a proportion of the output of a second wide band phase locked loop 600-603 to provide pseudo sidebands of constant amplitude. <IMAGE>",MARCONI GEC LTD,ATTWOOD JOHN WILLIAM;;JONES MICHAEL ARTHUR;;FLOYD JOHN THOMAS;;MITCHELL ALAN JAMES,,https://lens.org/160-112-974-769-01X,Patent Application,no,1,1,26,26,0,G01S13/4436;;G01S13/4445;;G01S13/4454;;G01S13/68;;G01S13/685,G01S13/44;;G01S13/68,H4D DRPF          RPF;;H4D DSPB          SPB;;H4D D251          RPF;;H4D D251          SPB;;H4D D265          RPF;;H4D D265          SPB;;H4D D507          RPF;;H4D D507          SPB;;H4D D512          RPF;;H4D D512          SPB;;U1S S1839,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
