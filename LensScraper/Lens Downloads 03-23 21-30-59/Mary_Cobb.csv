   The systems and methods described herein include systems and methods for serving data including streams of content, such as video content, audio content, and other types of content, and for serving the data at a selected level of service. The server provides a flexible platform that can examine an incoming request for content and based on certain attributes associated with that request, make a determination of the level of service that the request is to receive and a determination of whether the system currently has the capacity to handle the request at that level of service. Additionally and optionally, the server allows a network service provider/administrator to determine which attributes are relevant in determining the proper level of service and what level of service, or characteristics of that level of service will be associated with the attribute. To control the processing of requests so that different requests are kept on schedule and that established levels of service are met, the server can include an application program that manages the server processes access to a system resource, such as processor time, network bandwidth/access, disk access, or some other resource.
