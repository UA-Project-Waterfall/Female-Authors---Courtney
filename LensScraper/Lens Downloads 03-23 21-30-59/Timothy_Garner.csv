The device includes a moveable fixture operable to position a target in a field of view of a camera. A face of the target has linear regions of interest, and the face is normal to a line of sight of the camera. The moveable fixture is configured to rotate the target about a center of the face to adjust an angle of the linear regions of interest relative to a horizontal axis and a vertical axis of the field of view, thereby enabling a determination of a characteristic of the camera based on the linear regions of interest. Target rotation angles can be determined for any camera field position and indexed automatically to improve testing efficiencies while increasing the number of target positions that are characterized in the camera's field of view.

Multilayered specialty appliqus can be fabricated from the above fundamental oxyhalopolymer-adhesive composite structure, including layered adhesives for encapsulating tridimensional mechanical and electrical devices, such as RF, or microwave sensitive antennae for transmitting and receiving communications, providing protection from environmental electromagnetic effects (E ^{ 3 } ), shock and impact resistance, multidimensional deformable structures; housing for temperature control systems, etc. The properties of the appliqus can be modified by introducing various additives to the halopolymer and/or adhesive layers to customize electrical, and optical shielding, or reflectivity, corrosion resistance, and the like.

    An air bag calibrator that is used to calibrate a plurality of seat sensors within a seat simultaneously. The calibrator uses controlled pressure contained within an air bladder and an air press cylinder to apply a controlled force across an entire seat surface that actuates all of the seat sensors in a consistent and repeatable manner, a major improvement over existing seat calibration methods. This is accomplished by loading a seat onto the calibrator, recording a baseline seat sensor value for each of the seat sensors, extending the air press cylinder to an extended position and applying a controlled force across the entire seat surface. The air pressure in the air bladder is then increased or decreased to a target pressure for a predetermined time, at which time an actuated seat sensor values for each of the seat sensors is recorded. A PODS controller in contained within the seat that is used for controlling the deployment of air bags in a crash situation is then calibrated as a function of the recorded baseline seat sensor values and the actuated seat sensor values.
