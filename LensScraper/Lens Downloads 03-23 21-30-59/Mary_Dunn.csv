The device comprises a porous wound treatment material for removal of wound exudate from a wound under negative pressure, and which extends in lateral and longitudinal directions defining a horizontal plane. The device also comprises a plurality of vertically extending members in the porous wound treatment material, the vertically extending members being spaced apart and made of a more rigid material than the porous wound treatment material. Upon application of negative pressure to the porous wound treatment material, the porous wound treatment material is configured to contract in the horizontal plane with the vertically extending members reducing vertical movement of the porous wound treatment material. The vertically extending members comprise spaced columns, tiles or a combination thereof, dispersed throughout, and separated by portions of, the porous wound treatment material.
