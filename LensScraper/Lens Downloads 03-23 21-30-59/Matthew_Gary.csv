During the simulation, the simulator manager also generates a set of waveform data sequences, each representing periodically sampled values of a corresponding one of the simulated IC input and output signals. The IC tester includes a separate channel corresponding to each real IC input and output signal. The tester manager converts the waveform data sequence corresponding to each simulated IC input and output signal to a separate set of instructions provided as input to a corresponding one of the IC tester channels. When testing the real IC, each IC tester channel corresponding to a real IC input signal responds to its input instructions by generating and supplying to the IC an input signal having the sequence of values indicted by the waveform data sequence representing the corresponding simulated IC input signal.

Moreover, the systems can be configured with an optical spacer window located between the sample and the optics, and methods to account for changes in optical paths due to inclusion of the optical spacer window are disclosed.",APPLE INC,ARBORE MARK ALAN;;SHAMBAT GARY;;TERREL MATTHEW A,,https://lens.org/068-210-956-649-764,Patent Application,no,0,0,24,24,0,G01J3/0205;;G01J3/0216;;G01J3/0229;;G01J3/0256;;G01J3/0294;;G01J3/36;;G01J3/10;;G01N21/25;;G01J3/42;;G01J3/0205;;G01J3/0256;;G01J3/0294;;G01J3/10;;G01J3/108;;G01J3/36;;G01J3/42;;G01N21/25;;G01J3/0216;;G01N21/49;;G01N2021/4711;;G01J3/0229;;G01J3/0205;;G01J3/0229;;G01J3/0256;;G01J3/0294;;G01J3/108;;G01J3/36;;G01J3/42;;G01N21/25;;G01J3/0256;;G01J3/0294;;G01J3/108;;G01J3/36;;G01J3/42;;G01N21/25;;G01J3/0216;;G01N2021/4711;;G01N21/49;;G01J3/0205;;G01J3/10;;G01J3/0229,G01J3/02;;G01J3/10;;G01J3/36;;G01J3/42;;G01N21/25,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

   A carburetor for a scavenged two-stroke internal combustion engine has an enriched fuel-and-air mixing passage extending through a housing of the carburetor. Engaged to the housing is a body of an air flow modular assembly which carries a primary air flow passage which houses a butterfly-type control valve therein. The throttle valve of the fuel-and-air mixing passage is mechanically linked or cammed to the control valve of the air flow passage so that opening of the throttle valve soon after opens the control valve allowing additional air to enter and provide a leaner fuel-and-air ratio in the combustion chamber of the engine when running under load. The air flow modular assembly has a sealing-and-bearing assembly which eliminates air leakage from the surrounding environment along the shaft of the control valve and into the primary air flow passage. The sealing-and-bearing assembly has a bushing which inserts into a counter bore of a cylindrical bore which receives the rotating shaft of the control valve. The bushing is thereby disposed radially and sealingly between the shaft and the body of the modular assembly to journal the shaft and prevent air leakage. To prevent air bypass leakage around the plate of the control valve within the air flow passage, the bushing and respective counter bore do not extend all the way through the body and into the air passage, instead, a cylindrical sealing surface which in-part defines the cylindrical bore, sealingly engages the shaft axially between the counter bore and the air flow passage. In this way, the plate and body interface at the location of the rotating shaft can more exactly follow the contour of the air flow passage, thereby preventing unwanted bypass air flow when the control valve is closed.

Engaged to the housing is a body of an air flow modular assembly (12) which carries a primary air flow passage (18) which houses a butterfly-type control valve (16) therein. The throttle valve (32) of the fuel-and-air mixing passage is mechanically linked or cammed to the control valve of the air flow passage so that opening of the throttle valve soon after opens the control valve allowing additional air to enter and provide a leaner fuel-and-air ratio in the combustion chamber of the engine when running under load. The air flow modular assembly has a sealing-and-bearing assembly (50) which eliminates air leakage from the surrounding environment along the shaft (34) of the control valve and into the primary air flow passage. The sealing-and-bearing assembly has a bushing (62,64) which inserts into a counter bore (56,58) of a cylindrical bore (52) which receives the rotating shaft of the control valve. The bushing is thereby disposed radially and sealingly between the shaft and the body of the modular assembly to journal the shaft and prevent air leakage. To prevent air bypass leakage around the plate of the control valve within the air flow passage, the bushing and respective counter bore do not extend all the way through the body and into the air passage, instead, a cylindrical sealing surface which in-part defines the cylindrical bore, sealingly engages the shaft axially between the counter bore and the air flow passage. In this way, the plate (36) and body interface at the location of the rotating shaft can more exactly follow the contour of the air flow passage, thereby preventing unwanted bypass air flow when the control valve is closed.",WALBRO ENGINE MANAGEMENT LLC,BRAUN MATTHEW A;;BURNS GARY J;;ENDO MASATOSHI,,https://lens.org/024-496-567-871-150,Patent Application,yes,2,1,4,4,0,F02M17/04;;F02M17/04;;F02D9/106;;F02D9/106;;Y10S261/01;;Y10S261/01,F02M11/10;;F02D9/02;;F02D9/10;;F02M17/04;;F02M19/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Embodiments include forming conductive gates on the main surface of the semiconductor substrate, sidewall spacers on side surfaces of the gates, and aluminum disposable spacers on the sidewall spacers. A photoresist mask is then formed on gates and portions of the main surface intended to be implanted with impurities of a first conductivity type. Moderate or heavy source/drain implants of a second impurity type are then formed in the substrate, the aluminum disposable spacers on the sidewall spacers on the unmasked gates removed, and lightly or moderately doped source/drain extension implants of the second impurity type formed in the substrate. The first mask is then removed and a second photoresist mask is formed on the previously uncovered gates and implanted portions of the main surface. Moderate or heavy source/drain implants with impurities of the first conductivity type are then formed, the remaining aluminum disposable spacers removed, and lightly or moderately doped source/drain extension implants of the first conductivity type formed. By using aluminum disposable spacers, which can be easily formed and removed without damage to other structures on the substrate, the critical masking steps for source/drain ion implantation are reduced to two, thereby reducing production costs and increasing manufacturing throughput. By employing sidewall spacers, impurities are prevented from being implanted at the edges of the gates. Thus, when source/drain junctions are formed, as by heating and diffusing the implanted impurities, they are advantageously located proximal to the gate edges, and not under the gates, thereby improving device performance.",ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,LUKANC TODD;;BUYNOSKI MATTHEW S;;LING ZICHENG GARY,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC (1999-05-03);;CONVERSANT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT INC (2016-02-12),https://lens.org/100-416-443-479-239,Granted Patent,yes,4,14,1,1,0,H01L21/823864;;H01L21/823864,H01L21/8238,438/199;;438/301;;438/302;;438/303,2,0,,,"0-7803-3393-4, 1996 EEE, Mizuki Segawa, A .18 um Ti-Salisided p-MOSFET with Shollow Junctions Fabricated by Rapid Thermal Processing in an NH3 Ambient, p. 17.3.1 to 17.3.4.*;;K.

    A carburetor for a scavenged two-stroke internal combustion engine has an enriched fuel-and-air mixing passage extending through a housing of the carburetor. Engaged to the housing is a body of an air flow modular assembly which carries a primary air flow passage which houses a butterfly-type control valve therein. The throttle valve of the fuel-and-air mixing passage is mechanically linked or cammed to the control valve of the air flow passage so that opening of the throttle valve soon after opens the control valve allowing additional air to enter and provide a leaner fuel-and-air ratio in the combustion chamber of the engine when running under load. The air flow modular assembly has a sealing-and-bearing assembly which eliminates air leakage from the surrounding environment along the shaft of the control valve and into the primary air flow passage. The sealing-and-bearing assembly has a bushing which inserts into a counter bore of a cylindrical bore which receives the rotating shaft of the control valve. The bushing is thereby disposed radially and sealingly between the shaft and the body of the modular assembly to journal the shaft and prevent air leakage. To prevent air bypass leakage around the plate of the control valve within the air flow passage, the bushing and respective counter bore do not extend all the way through the body and into the air passage, instead, a cylindrical sealing surface which in-part defines the cylindrical bore, sealingly engages the shaft axially between the counter bore and the air flow passage. In this way, the plate and body interface at the location of the rotating shaft can more exactly follow the contour of the air flow passage, thereby preventing unwanted bypass air flow when the control valve is closed.

These objects are then identified within images containing the body parts using image recognition algorithms and/or user input. Thereafter, the images are modified so as to render the body parts as though the body parts were being impacted by the medical condition. The modifications are made by blending image data of the captured image with condition image data available to the processing system.",ORCA HEALTH INC;;ORCA HEALTH INC,BERRY MATTHEW M;;LYMAN DANIEL D;;ROBINSON GARY L,COCHLEAR LIMITED (2019-08-11);;ORCA HEALTH INC (2013-01-11),https://lens.org/173-862-985-682-862,Granted Patent,yes,63,21,4,4,0,G06T11/00;;G06T19/006;;G06V40/10;;G06V2201/03;;G06T11/00;;G06T11/60,G09G5/00;;G06T11/00;;G06T19/00,,26,0,,,"PIVI & Co, FatBooth, https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fatbooth/id372268904?mt=8, Updated Dec. 19, 2012, Version 3.4.;;Welcome to The AR Lungs Website, http://www.arlungs.com/, accessed Jan. 7, 2013.;;Mirracle, http://mirracle.de/, First Prototype of Magic Mirror, Jan. 3, 2011.;;U.S. Appl.

The simulations enable a user to see how a medical condition can affect the user by dynamically simulating the impact of the medical condition on captured images of body parts associated with the user in real-time. A user can select different medical conditions that are associated with different body parts. These objects are then identified within images containing the body parts using image recognition algorithms and/or user input. Thereafter, the images are modified so as to render the body parts as though the body parts were being impacted by the medical condition.

   Metallocene catalyzed polyethylenes are found to have improved physical properties, improved processability and improved balance of properties. Surprisingly, there is a direct relationship between MD shrinkage, and MD tear. Additionally, MD tear is greater than TD tear, and MD tear is also greater than intrinsic tear.

   A protection utility for compiled data in a computer system having dynamically configurable logical partitions determines the time for rebuilding compiled data, and selectively stores data in a form not requiring rebuild to meet a pre-specified recovery time limit. If the configuration changes, the protection strategy is automatically migrated to adapt to the new configuration. Preferably, the compiled data is multiple database indexes, which are selectively logged to reduce recovery time. Logging is selectively discontinued or extended responsive to changes in partition configuration, allowing a gradual migration to the target recovery time using the new set of configured resources.

   Metallocene catalyzed polyethylenes are found to have improved physical properties, improved processability and improved balance of properties. Surprisingly, there is a direct relationship between MD shrinkage, and MD tear. Additionally, MD tear is greater than TD tear, and MD tear is also greater than intrinsic tear. MD tear to TD tear ratios are above 0.9, and dart drop impact is above 500 g/mil. The polyethylenes have a relatively broad composition distribution and relatively broad molecular weight distribution.
