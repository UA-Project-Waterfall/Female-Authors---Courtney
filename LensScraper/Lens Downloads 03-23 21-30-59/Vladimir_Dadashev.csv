The obtained mixture is fed into a reactor in which re-esterification takes place at temperature 250-280C, pressure 15-20 MPa, for 5-10 minutes. The mixture is cooled and then fed into an extractor. The mixture is the extracted with carbon dioxide in supercritical conditions with carbon dioxide flow rate of 20-35 l/h, temperature 240-260C and pressure 15-20 MPa. The obtained homogeneous mixture is fed into a first separator for separation of glycerine from the end product at pressure 0.5 MPa and temperature 20-30C. The end product is fed into a second separator for separation of fatty acid ethyl alcohol from carbon dioxide at pressure 0.2-0.3 MPa and temperature 5-10C. The end product is fed into the second separator for separation of carbon dioxide at pressure 0.1-0.15 MPa and temperature 10-20C.

To implement method for development of multilayer heterogeneous oil deposit, drilling of vertical injection wells and production wells is carried out in underlying low-permeable bed and in overlying impermeable kerogen-containing formation. Wellbores are perforated with subsequent hydraulic fracturing of each formation by fluid on hydrocarbon basis with preservation of hydrodynamic isolation of formations. Proppant cracks are pumped into the formed system and an oxygen-containing agent is pumped into the injection well of the impermeable kerogen-containing formation to create an oxidation zone with high temperature. Production well of the obtained product of in-situ transformation of the oxygen-containing agent is performed along the production well, it is subjected to separation from liquid fractions of hydrocarbons and the produced inert gas agent is pumped to the injection well of the low-permeable oil-bearing bed. Oil is lifted through production well from low-permeable bed. Injection and production wells are drilled in impenetrable kerogen-containing formation at distance from each other, not less than radius of zone of complete oxygen consumption at injection of oxygen-containing agent.EFFECT: providing higher degree of mixability in low-permeable oil formations and displacing inert gas agent consisting of products of in-situ burning of kerogen-containing formations, which causes high degree of oil displacement from low-permeable reservoirs when performing joint development of different permeability beds.1 cl, 2 dwg",NEKOMMERCHESKOE PARTNERSTVO TEKHNOPARK GUBKINSKOGO UNIV NP TEKHNOPARK GUBKINSKOGO UNIV,GUSHCHIN PAVEL ALEKSANDROVICH;;KHLEBNIKOV VADIM NIKOLAEVICH;;KOPITSIN DMITRIJ SERGEEVICH;;DUBINICH VALERIYA NIKOLAEVNA;;POLISHCHUK ALEKSANDR MIKHAJLOVICH;;VINOKUROV VLADIMIR ARNOLDOVICH;;CHEREMISIN ALEKSEJ NIKOLAEVICH;;ZOBOV PAVEL MIKHAJLOVICH;;ANTONOV SERGEJ VLADIMIROVICH;;PUSTOSHKIN ROMAN VALEREVICH;;KACHKIN ANDREJ ALEKSANDROVICH;;DADASHEV MIRALI NURALIEVICH,,https://lens.org/054-536-298-878-03X,Granted Patent,no,7,2,1,1,0,E21B43/14;;E21B43/243;;E21B43/26,E21B43/14;;E21B43/243;;E21B43/26,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
