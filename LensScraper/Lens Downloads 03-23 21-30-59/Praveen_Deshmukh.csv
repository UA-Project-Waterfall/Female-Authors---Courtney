Er/Yb doped LZO phosphors is synthesized and characterized. Thermoluminescence and kinetic parameters for Er/Yb doped LZO phosphors have been studied for the first time. Synthesized phosphors were inspected by thermoluminescence (TL) glow curve and were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic technique. TL glow curves were recorded for variable concentration of doping ion (Yb3+) and ultra-violet (UV) exposure time. Trapping parameters are calculated using computerized glow curve deconvolution (CGCD) technique. It is found that TL glow curve intensity increases with dopant concentration. In both conditions, two broad TL glow curves were observed at 63 C and 154 C, which shows the number of trapping centers. synthesizing a plurality of analytical grade raw material havingaplurality of mol pe rce ntage doped with p hosphor, whe re in the mol percentage ranges from0.2 mols % 1 0 to 2.5 mol% mixingthe pluralityof analytical raw material thoroughly in a mixer using acetone for a , 104 definiteperiodoftirnetoformamixture 4' calcinatingtheforrmedmixtureinanaluminacrucibleataround90-1100degreeCesius 106 for at least 2 hours to remove irnpuritiesand moisturefromthe mixture groundingthecalcinatedrmixturethoroughlyforadefiniteperiodtoformapowder 108 whe re in calc inating the grounded mixture for at least 3 hours at around 1200-1400 degree Celsius studying a plurality of c haracte ristics of the powde red calcinated mixture using a plurality of measuring rnodule, where in the plurality of characteristics cornp rises of 110 diffraction pattern,spectral analysis, uniformity in size ofthe powdered particlesand concentration of doped phosphor Figure1 XRD pattern of LZO: Er, Yb ' -,1000 t4 0 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 2 o(degree) Figure 2",DESHMUKH RAM KRISHNA;;DUBEY NEHA;;DUBEY VIKAS;;MISHRA MANISH KUMAR;;SALUJA JAGJEET KAUR;;SWAMY N KUMAR;;VERMA OM PRAKASH;;YADAW PRAVEEN KUMAR,DUBEY NEHA;;SALUJA JAGJEET KAUR;;SWAMY N KUMAR;;DESHMUKH RAM KRISHNA;;MISHRA MANISH KUMAR;;DUBEY VIKAS;;VERMA OM PRAKASH;;YADAW PRAVEEN KUMAR,,https://lens.org/087-743-832-108-14X,Limited Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,C09K11/7769;;G01N1/34;;G01N1/28;;G01N1/44;;C04B35/62625;;C04B2235/3248;;C04B2235/3227;;C04B2235/3224;;G01N2001/2866;;G01N23/2055;;G01N23/2251;;G01T1/115,C09K11/77;;C04B35/626;;G01N1/28;;G01N1/34;;G01N1/44;;G01N23/00;;G01N23/2055;;G01N23/2251;;G01T1/115,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

Optimal solar power can be generated only when the solar panels are exposed to direct sunlight. But any change in weather condition results in cloudiness in real time, in such case angle of the solar panel has to be turned towards the sunlight. This invention proposes a novel smart powering technique where the solar energy is tracked in an autonomous way for increasing the production of solar energy. The solar tracker fixed biaxially is equipped with two small solar modules additionally. First module is horizontally installed and the second module is installed biaxially in the solar tracker. Position of the solar panel is controlled by the AI algorithm which takes input from prior data on sun trajectory through the year and also on output current generated from the solar panels. When sun light reduces due to clouds, then the current from small solar horizontal module will be more that of module oriented to the sun. This system is able to generate 18% solar energy more than conventional system in the presence of clouds. ri6able input Connect wi recess modules Read data a nd time Readl ing th e data _f the Sun coordinated fro thIe SD card Determvine the ilme of sunn Fse of the cuirrnt day Calculation of roations of stepper motors Ye 5 Tracker rotated to to azimuth and height sxr the starting positon Angles of the S un Rotaionr of ""big"" tracked Turn the small[ tracker to 82i1muth to the az2irnuth a ngle ange of ""he Sun of the Sun Turn the small tracker to the height of the angle of the Su |Compoare values of curfrt of small Sol ar modules Tracker goes to Yes No Rotation of -Dig- tracker horizontal position """"to height angle of the Sun rGet current and voltage valUs of tracker rGet current and voltage values of battery Send daa over the ilreless module Delay I Figure 1.
