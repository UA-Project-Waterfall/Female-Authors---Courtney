    An analyte test instrument having improved calibration and communication processes. The instrument employs a calibration method that allows it to communicate with any one of a plurality of data storage strips. A data storage strip including a memory device is inserted into the test port of the instrument. The data storage strip is identified, and the instrument establishes communications with the data storage strip using a protocol corresponding to the data storage strip. Second, the instrument employs a method for ensuring that the instrument is operated using valid calibration strips and test strips. The instrument determines whether one or more of test parameters stored in the instrument is invalid for a test strip inserted into the test port of the instrument. If a test parameter is invalid, an indication of the invalid strip parameter is displayed on the display. Finally, the instrument utilizes a method for determining the actual date and time of events that occurred before the instrument was provided with current date and time.

   An analyte test instrument having improved calibration and communication processes. The instrument employs a calibration method that allows it to communicate with any one of a plurality of data storage strips. A data storage strip including a memory device is inserted into the test port of the instrument. The data storage strip is identified, and the instrument establishes communications with the data storage strip using a protocol corresponding to the data storage strip. Second, the instrument employs a method for ensuring that the instrument is operated using valid calibration strips and test strips. The instrument determines whether one or more of test parameters stored in the instrument is invalid for a test strip inserted into the test port of the instrument. If a test parameter is invalid, an indication of the invalid strip parameter is displayed on the display. Finally, the instrument utilizes a method for determining the actual date and time of events that occurred before the instrument was provided with current date and time.
