The distractor element has a body, a proximal end and a distal end. The distractor element has a thickness and a length. The distractor element is configured for mounting between the superior and inferior spinous processes in a working configuration. The distractor element is generally tapered at the distal end in an insertion configuration. The instrument also includes an insertion shaft attached to the proximal end and a first shaft joint mounted between the frame and the insertion shaft.",DIETZE JR DONALD DAVID;;BANKOSKI BRIAN REED,DIETZE JR DONALD DAVID;;BANKOSKI BRIAN REED,,https://lens.org/173-389-005-250-634,Granted Patent,yes,34,52,2,2,0,A61B17/0206;;A61B17/0206;;A61B17/025;;A61B17/025;;A61B17/0293;;A61B17/0293;;A61B17/7065;;A61B17/7065;;A61B2017/00557;;A61B2017/00557;;A61B2017/00915;;A61B2017/00915;;A61B2017/00946;;A61B2017/00946;;A61B2017/0256;;A61B2017/0256;;A61B2017/0262;;A61B2017/0262,A61B1/32;;A61B17/00;;A61B17/02;;A61B17/70,600/215;;600/201;;600/231,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
