   A vehicle pivoting closure assembly has a concealed power actuator remotely operated by a controller to open and close a closure or liftgate. A hinge member of the power actuator is engaged pivotally to a vehicle structure about a hinge axis, and rigidly to the closure. An armature extends pivotally from an elongated linear moving rack about a rack pivot axis and to the hinge member. The armature also pivotally engages the hinge member about a secondary pivot axis disposed parallel to the hinge axis and rack pivot axis. The rack is driven by a pinion gear train powered by a motor through a clutch. The hinge, the rack, the gear train and the motor are all supported by a reinforcement tray forming a modular engaged to the vehicle structure. The tray isolates the extreme dynamic loads placed upon the hinge by the motor, thereby eliminating the need to further reinforce the vehicle structure.

SOLUTION: The closing assembly has a hidden power actuator remotely operated by a controller to open or close the closing section, i.e., a lift gate. The hinge member 18 of the power actuator 16 is coupled with a vehicle structure section pivotably around a hinge shaft 24 and rigidly fitted to the closing section. An armature is extended from a slender linear moving rack to the hinge member pivotably around a rack pivotal shaft. The armature is coupled with the hinge member 18 pivotably around a second pivotal shaft arranged in parallel with the hinge shaft 24 and the rack pivotal shaft 26. The rack is driven by a pinion gear train operated by a motor via a clutch. A hinge, the rack, the gear train, and the motor are wholly supported by a modular reinforcing tray 27 coupled with the structure section.",DELPHI TECH INC,LLOYD WALKER ROGERS JR;;MCCARTHY-GARLAND ANN P;;DOMBROWSKI DOUGLAS;;LINDSAY THEODORE J;;MARTIN IAN;;KUHLMAN HOWARD WARREN;;CIAVAGLIA MICHAEL ANTONIO,,https://lens.org/011-171-218-102-284,Patent Application,no,0,0,6,6,0,B60J5/105;;E05Y2201/434;;E05Y2201/722;;E05Y2800/242;;E05Y2900/532;;E05Y2900/546;;E05F15/619;;E05F15/63;;B60J5/105;;E05Y2201/434;;E05Y2201/722;;E05Y2900/532;;E05Y2800/242;;E05Y2900/546;;E05F15/619;;E05F15/63,B60J5/10;;E05F15/12,,0,0,,,,PENDING
