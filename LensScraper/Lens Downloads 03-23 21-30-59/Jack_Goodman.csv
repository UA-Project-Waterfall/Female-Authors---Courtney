The method is accomplished by positioning a rapid impacting tool (21) at about 90 degrees against the one side of the lower portion of a cap (15) covering a tooth (13). The opposite side of the cap is abutted with a kinetic energy absorbing element (27). The flexing against the cap (15) is small while the frequency is high.,GOODMAN JACK,GOODMAN JACK,,https://lens.org/017-990-968-426-04X,Patent Application,yes,8,0,2,4,0,A61C3/16;;A61C3/16;;A61C3/166;;A61C3/166;;A61C17/20;;A61C17/20,A61C3/03;;A61C3/16,,1,0,,,See also references of EP 0920285A4,PENDING

   A storage vessel is provided to reduce evaporation of volatile substances such as matrix solution used for preparing samples originating from electrophoresis gel slabs for mass spectrometry. The storage vessel is configured with a reservoir having a recess to accommodate the volatile substance. The reservoir includes a channel for receiving a heat exchange fluid to cool the liquid. The reservoir member has an inlet and an outlet for connection to a circulating chiller bath. The storage vessel is configured for transport using the conveyor of a biological sample preparation apparatus, such as an autopipetting device.

The first support is mounted on a movable carriage and is moved toward the second support so that the gel tube slides onto the plunger rod to unload the gel from the gel tube. A plurality of gel tubes can be mounted in a rack and the rack coupled to the first support. The first support preferably includes a plurality of openings oriented with the gel tubes for guiding a respective plunger rod through the axial passage of the gel tubes. In preferred embodiments, the second support supporting the plunger rods is substantially stationary while the first support moves toward the second support so that the gel tubes slide onto the plunger rods. A plunger member such as a rubber ball is positioned in the axial passage of the gel tubes between the gel and the plunger rod to unload the gel in a substantially uniform manner without tearing or breaking the gel.

   A gel relaxer device is provided for relieving stress in an electrophoresis gel between clamping surfaces of a gel clamp. The device includes a pair of operating arms having a gel gripping surface and a clamping actuating surface. The operating arms move toward each other to enable the gripping surfaces to grip and support an electrophoresis gel suspended by a gel clamp. The actuating surfaces of the arms engage the clamping jaws of the gel clamp to open the jaws to allow the gel to relax and assume its normal position and orientation. The operating arms are then separated to allow the gel clamp to again close and clamp the gel. The gel and gel clamp can then be transported to a selected processing stage.

    An apparatus for expressing and unloading an isoelectric focusing gel from an electrophoresis gel tube includes a first support for supporting the gel tube, a plunger rod and a second support for supporting the plunger rod. The first support is mounted on a movable carriage and is moved toward the second support so that the gel tube slides onto the plunger rod to unload the gel from the gel tube. A plurality of gel tubes can be mounted in a rack and the rack coupled to the first support. The first support preferably includes a plurality of openings oriented with the gel tubes for guiding a respective plunger rod through the axial passage of the gel tubes. In preferred embodiments, the second support supporting the plunger rods is substantially stationary while the first support moves toward the second support so that the gel tubes slide onto the plunger rods. A plunger member such as a rubber ball is positioned in the axial passage of the gel tubes between the gel and the plunger rod to unload the gel in a substantially uniform manner without tearing or breaking the gel.

    An alignment plate is provided with a plurality of holes for guiding a pipette tip toward a sample plate of a MALDI mass spectrometer. Each of the holes is provided with a conical upper contour in order to guide the pipette tip toward a specific location on the sample plate. Two companion alignment plates are used in order to overlay two separate arrays of samples on the sample plate. For instance, a first of two alignment plates is formed with a 1010 array of holes so that a 1010 array of samples is deposited by the pipette tip onto the sample plate. The second of the two alignment plates is formed with a 99 array of holes so that a 99 array of samples is deposited on the sample plate at locations offset from the 1010 array of samples already on the sample plate. The number of samples loaded on the sample plate is large and the space on the sample plate is more fully utilized.

Each of the holes is provided with a conical upper contour in order to guide the pipette tip toward a specific location on the sample plate. Two companion alignment plates are used in order to overlay two separate arrays of samples on the sample plate. For instance, a first of two alignment plates is formed with a 1010 array of holes so that a 1010 array of samples is deposited by the pipette tip onto the sample plate. The second of the two alignment plates is formed with a 99 array of holes so that a 99 array of samples is deposited on the sample plate at locations offset from the 1010 array of samples already on the sample plate. The number of samples loaded on the sample plate is large and the space on the sample plate is more fully utilized.

   An apparatus for expressing and unloading an isoelectric focusing gel from an electrophoresis gel tube includes a first support for supporting the gel tube, a plunger rod and a second support for supporting the plunger rod. The first support is mounted on a movable carriage and is moved toward the second support so that the gel tube slides onto the plunger rod to unload the gel from the gel tube. A plurality of gel tubes can be mounted in a rack and the rack coupled to the first support. The first support preferably includes a plurality of openings oriented with the gel tubes for guiding a respective plunger rod through the axial passage of the gel tubes. In preferred embodiments, the second support supporting the plunger rods is substantially stationary while the first support moves toward the second support so that the gel tubes slide onto the plunger rods. A plunger member such as a rubber ball is positioned in the axial passage of the gel tubes between the gel and the plunger rod to unload the gel in a substantially uniform manner without tearing or breaking the gel. Guide members can be positioned on the top edge of the gel slabs for guiding the gel from the gel tube between the plates that support the gel slab. The guide members include inclined guiding surfaces forming a V-shaped trough above the edge of the gel slab.

Uma vez que as meias canas de sucção são aplicadas à superfície do coração, o aperto de um cabo fixa o braço no lugar.

   The invention is a method and apparatus for performing beating heart surgery, in which a single articulating arm supports multiple suction pods. Once the suction pods are applied to the heart surface, tightening a cable fixes the arm in place. Then, the suction pods may be spread apart from each other to tighten the surface of the cardiac tissue lying between the suction pods. In one embodiment, fixation of the arm as well as the spreading apart of the suction pods may occur concurrently or almost concurrently through the tensioning of a single cable. Additional embodiments of the method, system and its components are shown.
