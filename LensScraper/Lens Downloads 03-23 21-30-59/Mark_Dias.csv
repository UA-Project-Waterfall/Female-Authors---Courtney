Specifically, web sites whose templates are complimentary, i.e. a first web site having a peak in arrival traffic at time t1 and a second web site that has trough in arrival traffic at time t1, are designated as being candidates for co-location. In addition, the present invention uses the templates identified for the traffic patterns of web sites to determine thresholds for offloading traffic to other servers. These thresholds include a first threshold at which offloading should be performed, a second threshold that takes into consideration the lead time needed to begin offloading, and a third threshold that takes into consideration a lag time needed to stop all offloading of traffic to the other servers.",IBM,DIAS DANIEL MANUEL;;KING RICHARD PERVIN;;LIU ZHEN;;SQUILLANTE MARK STEVEN;;XIA HONGHUI,,https://lens.org/169-511-714-203-47X,Granted Patent,no,0,5,13,13,0,H04L41/142;;H04L47/122;;H04L43/16;;H04L67/1008;;H04L67/1029;;H04L67/101;;H04L67/1021;;H04L67/1012;;H04L67/1023;;H04L69/329;;H04L67/10015;;H04L67/1001;;H04L67/535;;H04L47/122;;H04L41/142;;H04L43/16;;H04L67/1008;;H04L67/101;;H04L69/329;;H04L67/1021;;H04L67/1029;;H04L67/1023;;H04L67/1012;;H04L9/40;;H04L67/535;;H04L67/1001;;H04L67/10015,H04L12/24;;H04L12/56;;H04L29/06;;H04L29/08,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In one embodiment, diagnostic data gathering is controlled based upon a number of previous occurrences of a condition in some predefined or user-configured time frame that triggers diagnostic data gathering and/or a number of previous executions of an action performed in some predefined or user-configured time frame responsive to the condition in the monitored system.",SARIG YAIR;;DAGEVILLE BENOIT;;FALLEN MARCUS;;MYSORENAGARAJARAO AJITH KUMAR;;DIAS KARL;;RAMACHER MARK;;NGAI GARY;;ORACLE INT CORP,SARIG YAIR;;DAGEVILLE BENOIT;;FALLEN MARCUS;;MYSORENAGARAJARAO AJITH KUMAR;;DIAS KARL;;RAMACHER MARK;;NGAI GARY,ORACLE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION (2008-10-13),https://lens.org/091-622-411-246-417,Granted Patent,yes,99,2,24,24,0,G06F11/0748;;G06F11/0778;;G06F11/0781;;H04L41/0681;;H04L41/16;;G06F11/0778;;H04L41/0681;;H04L41/16;;G06F11/0748;;G06F11/0781,G06F19/00;;G06F11/30,702/108;;700/26;;702/183;;714/37,55,11,066-588-240-711-296;;027-894-609-985-723;;060-617-362-872-807;;085-348-481-391-146;;063-970-483-418-703;;002-144-519-298-25X;;079-358-454-391-898;;026-532-939-569-277;;013-841-790-068-366;;074-690-180-885-024;;046-972-181-490-702,10.1109/icemi.2007.4350937;;10.1093/bjps/axi147;;10.1093/bjps/axi148;;10.1109/snpd.2008.67;;10.1093/biomet/82.4.702;;10.1214/09-ss057;;10.1007/bf02595718;;10.2307/2669380;;10.1023/a:1018912507879;;10.1016/j.engappai.2006.07.002;;10.1016/j.compind.2007.12.005,"Non-Final Office Action for U.S. Appl.

The collection process is done inside the database, and the collection process is highly efficient as data is retrieved directly from the shared memory of the database kernel. The data captured allows both system level and user level analysis to be performed without unduly impacting system performance, e.g., by eliminating or reducing the requirement to repeat the workload in order to diagnose problems. The AWR is configured to automatically capture snapshots of statistics data on a periodic basis as well as purge stale data on a periodic basis.

The AWR runs automatically to collect performance data about the operation of the database system, and stores the data that it captures into the database. The collection process is done inside the database, and the collection process is highly efficient as data is retrieved directly from the shared memory of the database kernel. The data captured allows both system level and user level analysis to be performed without unduly impacting system performance, e.g., by eliminating or reducing the requirement to repeat the workload in order to diagnose problems. The AWR is configured to automatically capture snapshots of statistics data on a periodic basis as well as purge stale data on a periodic basis.

SUBSTANCE: claimed invention describes new polymer and process for preparing polymers containing long chain linear side branchings. Long chain linear branchings are located at frequency of less than 5 branchings per 1000 carbon atoms of main chains. Some branchings have molecular weight which is greater than critical value of the molecular weight for intertwining polymer chains. Polymer containing long chain linear branchings are prepared by introducing alpha-olefin macromolecule in the polymerization process in solution or suspension in the presence of metallocene catalyst. Polymers have superb processibility in melt and superb mechanical properties of solid polymers. Polymers are suitable to be processed into various products by standard methods.
