A blanking circuit suppresses the NMR signal during the time interval each noise pulse is detected to remove the noise pulse prior to image reconstruction.,GEN ELECTRIC,CRAWFORD CARL R;;EASH MATTHEW G;;SOUZA STEVEN P;;PELC NORBERT J;;DALLAPIAZZA DENNIS G;;SMALL DANIEL S;;STORMONT ROBERT S,GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY (1994-06-30),https://lens.org/021-584-959-989-992,Granted Patent,yes,8,30,4,4,0,G01R33/3621;;G01R33/3621;;G01R33/5608;;G01R33/5608,G01R33/32;;A61B5/055;;G01R33/36;;G01R33/56,324/322;;324/318,6,1,055-161-440-295-336,10.1002/mrm.1910030306;;3724420,"Suppression of Internal Noise Induced by the Vibration of a Cylindrical Shell, 1993 JSME Proceedings of the 1993 International Conference on Advanced Mechatronics, Tokyo Japan.;;Extraction of Noise Spikes in MR Imaging, MJSanz, EMHaacke, Proceedings of Society of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, JMRI, vol. 2P, p. 789, 1992.;;Spike Removal from MR Raw Data Sets, T.
