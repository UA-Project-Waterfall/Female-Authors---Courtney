Detectability of the randomly varying magnetic characteristic can be enhanced by recording a selected electrical signal thereon. Digital and analog signals may be used. Both saturation and nonsaturation forms of recording can be used. A verification apparatus senses the enhanced randomly varying magnetic characteristic and compares it to a prestored representative profile previously created. Correspondence between the prestored profile and the currently read characteristic indicates an authentic object. Other objects can be rejected.
