The capsule also includes an aerostat tethered to the capsule via the cable and configured to inflate with the gas produced by the reaction chamber, and to ascend above the capsule with the transmitter to increase a distance for transmitting the sonobuoy data to the aircraft.",BOEING CO,BONANG JAMES JOSEPH;;GALL STEVEN LEE;;GREENFIELD MICHAEL JEFFREY;;MOSTEN RANDALL L;;RAGOZZINO MATTHEW JOSEPH,THE BOEING COMPANY (2019-06-17),https://lens.org/198-625-317-041-160,Granted Patent,yes,9,0,2,2,0,B63B22/003;;G01S15/66;;G01S7/003;;G01S7/537;;B63G8/39;;B63B22/003,B63B22/00;;B63G8/39;;G01S7/537,,13,0,,,"Lisa Zyga; Electricity from seawater: New method efficiently produces hydrogen peroxide for fuel cells; https://phys.org/news/2016-05-electricity-seawater-method-efficiently-hydrogen.;;Aerostat; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerostat.;;Air—Density, Specific Weight and Thermal Expansion Coefficient at Varying Temperature and Constant Pressures; https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/air-density-specific-weight-d_600.html.;;David Jones; Flying Heavier or Lighter Than Air; https://www.chemistryworld.com/opinion/flying-heavier-or-lighter-than-air/6195.article.;;http://www.intpowertechcorp.com/H2_Seawater_1TOFCJ.pdf.;;https://www.airbornesystems.co.uk/airborne-systems-products-services/aerial-delivery-search-and-rescue-products/aerial-delivery-equipment-sar-copy-2/skad-survival-kit-air-droppable/.;;Kevin Bullis; Harvesting Power From the Ocean; https://www.technologyreview.com/s/408557/harvesting-power-from-the-ocean/ Aug. 23, 2007.;;Melissa Mahony; Generating hydrogen from seawater to power boats; http://www.zdnet.com/article/generating-hydrogen-from-seawater-to-power-boats/; Oct. 26, 2010.;;Nidhi Subbaraman; Making Unlimited Hydrogen From Salt Water and Wastewater; https://www.fastcompany.com/1781495/making-unlimited-hydrogen-salt-water-and-wastewater; Sep. 20, 2011.;;Ocean Energy Light Buoy; Dept of Energy Technology Aalborg University.;;Power Buoy: Energy of Waves to Charge Underwater Robots; Futurist News; http://futuristicnews.com/power-buoy-anergy-of-waves-to-charge-underwater-robots/.;;Tina Casey; With This Modest Little Machine, US Navy Could Rule the Seas; https://cleantechnica.com/2015/01/02/new-machine-makes-sustainable-hydrogen-from-seawater/.;;University of Wollongong; Splitting the sea: Turning ocean water into hydrogen fuel; https://phys.org/news/2013-06-sea-ocean-hydrogen-fuel html.",ACTIVE
