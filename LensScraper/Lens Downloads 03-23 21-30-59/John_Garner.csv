In the present invention the cable core is opened up into a number of core units by passing through an opening member. The opening member is freely ridable on the cable core and has a hole for each unit. The opener is held against a support member and an air bearing formed between the two members. Air is also usually fed to the holes in the opener member through which the core units pass to prevent flow of powder out from the bed. The opening member can be positioned in the fluidized bed or outside immediately prior to passage of the cable core through the bed. The units are each in a substantially closed condition in the bed and the units close to a single core also in the bed. - i",NORTHERN TELECOM LTD,GARNER JOHN N,,https://lens.org/137-174-215-280-387,Granted Patent,no,0,0,18,18,0,H01B13/321,H01B7/282;;H01B13/22;;H01B13/32,326-L29,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

ASSOCIATED ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES Ltd. Aug. 18, 1964 [Aug. 28, 1963], No. 34077/63. Heading H1A. In order to increase the elasticity and tensile strength of the lead sheathing of an oil-filled, or insulating gas-filled electric cable, so allowing the sheath itself to take up changes in pressure which may occur in and outside the cable, the sheath is formed from oxide coated lead particles which are mechanically worked so as to break up the oxide coatings and pressureweld the particles together, the oxide film being dispersed through the mass to act as a strengthening agent.

   Electro-dynamic loudspeakers typically include a diaphragm having a conductor applied to one of its surfaces. The diaphragm is secured to a frame. The conductor is connected to a power supply for providing electrical current through linear traces of the conductor that interact with magnetic fields generated by magnets that are mounted to the frame. The diaphragm is driven by a motive force created when current passes through the conductor within the magnetic field. The electrical current is varied to create an acoustical output from the electro-dynamic loudspeaker. Different methods of tensioning the diaphragm are provided for simplifying the manufacturing process and for assuring proper diaphragm tension.

   Presented is a satellite communication system that allows aggregation of available transponder bandwidth. A channel signal is divided into subparts (e.g., data packets), formatted (e.g., encapsulated) and distributed among a plurality of subchannels according to bandwidth availability. Each subpart is encoded with information that facilitates proper reconstruction of the original channel data at the receiving station. The subchannels are transmitted to a receiving station, which synchronizes the subchannels and decapsulates the subparts. The receiving station includes a subchannel combiner which combines the decapsulated subparts in select subchannels to produce a reconstructed version of a user-selected channel signal. A controller in the receiving station identifies the subchannels to be combined in response to user selection and sends commands to a subchannel combiner. The receiving station also includes a connectivity matrix that discards the unnecessary subchannels before demodulation and reconstruction, reducing the number of demodulators in the system.

BRADFORD DYERS' ASSOCIATION Ltd. April 13, 1961 [Feb. 18, 1960], No. 5798/60. Class 80 (2). [Also in Group XVI] A driving-shaft rotating at a constant speed rotates a driven member at a speed depending upon a variable condition, by means of a pneumatic tyre the effective radius of which is varied to vary the output speed. As applied to a textile machine in which fabric 9 is drawn from a vat by nip rollers 7, 8, a compensating roller 10 is carried by an arm 11 pivotable about 12 to take up slack in the fabric. The arm 11 controls a valve 13 controlling a pneumatic motor 15 having its piston linked to a gear-box 17 pivotally mounted about a shaft 18. A tyre 19 is mounted on a shaft 20 and frictionally engages a driving pulley 21 and is geared to the nip roller 8. If the compensating roller 10 moves upwardly to take-up slack the gear-box is pivoted to lower the tyre which is pressed harder against the pulley to decrease its effective radius and rotate the nip roller 8 faster. An initial adjustment can be effected by altering the axial position of the pulley 21 which is of conical shape. In a modification a valve moved by the compensating roller directly controls the air pressure in the tyre. In another modification in which fabric is wound on the top roller of a pair of nip rollers, the bottom roller of which is directly driven by a pneumatic tyre, the nip rollers are mounted on a rocking frame and bear on the tyre which is compressed as the weight of the fabric increases so that the rollers are driven more slowly. Preferably the surface of the tyre is composed of segments separated by gaps.",BRADFORD DYERS ASS LTD,WILFORD ERNEST;;KNOWLES JOHN CONRAD;;GARNER HAROLD THORNTON,,https://lens.org/092-726-393-572-042,Granted Patent,no,0,3,1,1,0,F16H15/04;;F16H61/02;;F16H2710/00,F16H15/04;;F16H61/02,B8R RRH11         RRH1;;F2D DA001         DA-M;;F2D DA023         DA-M;;F2D DB040         DA-M;;F2D DCG           DA-M;;F2D DC084         DA-M;;F2D DC097         DA-M;;F2D DC103         DA-M;;F2D DC120         DA-M;;F2D DC121         DA-M,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The wire is then passed through a hot air duct to evaporate solvent remaining on its surface. The dried wire is guided through a solvent-based colourant reservoir to coat it with colourant and passed against a wiping surface to wipe excess colourant from its surface. The coated wire is passed through a hot air duct to evaporate some of the solvent in the colourant, and through a cold air duct to form a surface skin on the colourant before it passes over a guide wheel. The surface skin prevents adherence of the colourant to the guide wheel. The coated wire is passed by a spraying device which intermittently sprays solvent-based colourant on the wire to band encode it. The band-encoded wire is passed through a hot air duct to evaporate some of the solvent in the bands of colourant, and through a cold air duct to form a surface skin on the bands of colourant before they pass over a guide wheel. The surface skin prevents adherence of the bands of colourant to the guide wheel.

June 1, 1951 [March 2. 1950], No. 5375/50. Class 132(3) [Also in Group XXXVIII] A robot includes apparatus for reproducing sound from a record through a loudspeaker and means, also controlled by the same recorded vibrations for controlling one or more-gestures by parts of the robot's body, in which the sound is reproduced and the gesturesare controlled respectively by separate reproducing heads spaced apart in the direction of travel of the record so as to introduce or compensate for time lag between the gesture and corresponding sounds. An endless steel tape A magnetized in accordance with recorded speech, passes through reproducing heads C, B in turn. Head B is connected to a loudspeaker D<SP>1</SP> via an amplifier D and head C is connected to amplifiers E and F. Amplifier F responds to frequencies, e.g. from 0 to 400 c.p.s. and E amplifies a higher range of frequencies. Relays E<SP>1 </SP>F<SP>1</SP> are each controlled by one of the amplifiers E, F and have contacts controlling solenoid actuated pneumatic valves E<SP>2</SP>, F<SP>2</SP> which control air under pressure to tip actuating pistons E<SP>3</SP>, E<SP>4</SP> and to bellows F<SP>3</SP> connected to a pivoted lower jaw member F<SP>4</SP>. To protect the bellows F<SP>3</SP> against excess pressure, a limit switch F<SP>7</SP> breaks the circuit of solenoid F<SP>2</SP> when the jaw F<SP>4</SP> is fully opened, and air pressure to the bellows is released. A further limit switch H controls a relay H<SP>1</SP> which is normally energized from low voltage supply G, and one or more condensers H<SP>2</SP> ensure that the relay is not de-energized unless'the jaw F<SP>4</SP> is open, e.g. from two to six seconds. When the relay is de-energized, contacts on it close and cause solenoid controlled valves J, K, controlling the eyes and hand respectively, to be operated. A non- return valve J<SP>5</SP> having an adjustable throttled by-pass, is included in the air line to the plunger J<SP>1</SP> operating the eyes and permits the eyes to operate 'rapidly in one direction and relatively slowly in the other direction., The normal time lag in the operation of lips and lower jaw is allowed for by adjustable spacing of the reproducing heads C, B, accurate synchronization of speech and gestures thus being possible. The apparatus may include two or more figures performing the same or different gestures and more than two, or only one amplifier may be provided and filter circuits or turned relays may be used at appropriate parts of the circuit for restricting the response to desired frequency ranges. Film strips and disc records are also specified as recording means.",RECORDED SOUND LTD,FLETCHER HOWARD LYNTON;;GARNER CHARLES FREDERICK;;CLARKE JOHN JOSEPH,,https://lens.org/059-643-791-541-102,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G11B33/06,G11B33/06,B8M MD            MD;;B8M M681          MD;;G5R RB16          16;;G5R RB264         16;;G5R RB37Y         16;;G5R RB38Y         16;;G5R RB39X         16;;G5R RB39Y         16;;G5R RB426         16;;G5R RB511         16;;G5R RB55Y         16;;G5R RB551         16;;G5R RB61Y         16;;G5R RB612         16;;G5R RB681         16;;G5R RB788         16,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The dried wire is guided through a solvent-based colorant reservoir to coat it with colorant and passed against a wiping surface to wipe excess colorant from its surface. The coated wire is passed through a hot air duct to evaporate some of the solvent in the colorant, and through a cold air duct to harden an outer surface of the colorant before it passes over a guide wheel. The hardened surface prevents adherence of the colorant to the guide wheel. The coated wire is passed by a spraying device which intermittently sprays solvent-based colorant on the wire to band encode it. The band-encoded wire is passed through a hot air duct to evaporate some of the solvent in the bands of colorant, and through a cold air duct to form a hardened outer surface skin on the bands of colorant before they pass over a guide wheel.

    An overthrust protection system for a gas turbine in which fuel is supplied at a controlled flow rate to a combustor ( 4 ) of the gas turbine. The overthrust protection system uses a bypass valve ( 24 ) to divert fuel flow away from the combustor ( 4 ). The opening of this valve is controlled by an overthrust controller ( 28 ) to divert fuel flow in response to a detected overthrust condition of the gas turbine. 

   Diverting some of the fuel flow in this manner brings about a reduction in the thrust, allowing the overthrust condition to be controlled without resorting to a complete shut down of the gas turbine.

    The invention provides computational methods and compositions for identifying polymorphic repeats in genes. Candidate polymorphic repeats are identified by detecting tandem repeats in a target coding sequence, scoring the repeats for polymorphic probability, and generating a dataset correlating the repeats with polymorphic probability. Actual polymorphic repeat are identified by further detecting the candidate polymorphic repeat in each of a population of different coding sequences, and determining whether the candidate polymorphic repeat is polymorphic in the population. Computationally derived polymorphic repeats are validated with phenotypic variations and these correlates are used to detect the presence or absence of such phenotypic variation in test genes. Variances at polymorphic repeats are identified by detecting in a test gene or coding region the presence or absence of variance at a disclosed unconventional polymorphic repeat.

Det fordelaktige ved brønnhode enheten er at den kan gi operatøren mer tid til boreoperasjoner i stedet for sirkulerings og hullbehandlings operasjoner. Det karakteristiske ved en foreslåtte brønnhode enheten er at den inkluderer en teleskopisk foringsrør henger som er festet til en foringsrørstreng. En aktuator blir festet på den teleskopiske rørhengeren som så senkes ned til brønnhodehuset. En annen enhet ekspanderer og lander på en del av brønnhodehuset. Deretter lander foringsrørhengeren på den ekspanderte enheten. Den ekspanderte en heten har evne til å overføre laster fra foringsrørhengere til brønnhodehuset og en konisk innvendig overflate. Den teleskopiske foringsrørhengeren består av en aktiveringsring og en låsering som forårsaker bevegelse rundt foringsrørhengeren. Formålet med den ekspanderte enheten er å hindre at aktiveringsringen beveger seg ved for tidlig kontakt når foringsrørhengeren blir senket eller kjørt inn i borehullet. Enheten som ekspanderer sørger for at foringsrørhengeren ikke skades under bevegelse i borehullet som følge av for tidlig aktivering av aktiveringsringen.,VETCO GRAY INC,GETTE NICHOLAS P;;HERBEL RYAN;;NELSON JOHN;;FAZ ARMANDO;;GARNER DETRICK,,https://lens.org/184-539-806-429-052,Patent Application,no,0,0,10,10,0,E21B23/02;;E21B33/03;;E21B33/04;;E21B33/04;;E21B33/047;;E21B33/04;;E21B23/02;;E21B33/03,E21B33/03;;E21B33/037,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The connection monitor and a communication application operate concurrently to enable a user to interrogate a modem for status information while a connection with the modem remains open and functional with other communication applications. A serial device driver presents two types of entry to the operating system, one for normal communications and one for a collateral or side-door entrance from a connection monitor. The serial device driver multiplexes a packaged diagnostic command into the open channel with the data process by the serial driver and dispatched to a local modem. The local modem performs a demultiplexing function by routing traditional communication data to a traditional COM process and diagnostic information is routed to a diagnostic process. Diagnostic status information is likewise packaged and multiplexed into a data stream with traditional COM data information for dispatch to the serial device driver and demultiplexed therein. The inband diagnostic driver interfaces directly with the connection monitor via the operating system for returning the diagnostic status information as retrieved from the local modem.

Unlike prior implementa&shy;tions, the invention identifies malicious packets having complex encapsulations that can not be identified using traditional techniques, such as ternary content addressable memories (TCAM) or lookup tables.",CISCO TECH INC,STACY JOHN KENNETH;;GARNER TREVOR;;HUGHES MARTIN W;;LEE WILLIAM R,,https://lens.org/155-696-438-955-995,Patent Application,yes,5,3,13,13,0,H04L47/32;;H04L49/90;;H04L49/901;;H04L49/9042;;H04L49/9047;;H04L63/1416;;H04L63/1458;;H04L49/901;;H04L63/1458;;H04L49/9042;;H04L63/1416;;H04L47/32;;H04L49/90;;H04L49/9047,H04L12/56;;H04L47/32;;H04L49/901,,2,1,051-228-262-589-400,10.1109/fpga.2002.1106666,"HUTCHINGS ET AL.: ""Assisting network intrusion detection with reconfigurable hardware"", FIELD-PROGRAMMABLE CUSTOM COMPUTING MACHINES, 2002, PROCEEDINGS 10TH ANNUAL IEEE SYMPOSIUM, 22 April 2002 (2002-04-22);;See also references of EP 1754349A4",PENDING

   Electro-dynamic loudspeakers typically include a diaphragm having a conductor applied to one of its surfaces where the diaphragm is secured to a frame. The conductor is connected to a power supply for providing electrical current through linear traces of the conductor that interact with magnetic fields generated by magnets that are mounted to the frame. The diaphragm is driven by a motive force created when current passes through the conductor within the magnetic field. The electrical current is varied to create an acoustical output from the electro-dynamic loudspeaker. Different methods of attaching the diaphragm are provided for simplifying the manufacturing process and for obtaining a robust electro-dynamic loudspeaker.

To that end, the hash table is constructed so each hash-table entry is associated with a different linked list, and each linked-list entry stores, inter alia, “signature” information and at least one pair of values defining a range associated with the signature. The technique modifies the signature based on the results of one or more preliminary range checks. As a result, the signature's associated ranges are more evenly distributed among the hash table's linked lists. Thus, the linked lists are on average shorter in length, thereby enabling faster and more efficient range searches.

   Electro-dynamic loudspeakers typically include a diaphragm having a conductor applied to one of its surfaces. The diaphragm is secured to a frame. The conductor is connected to a power supply for providing electrical current through linear traces of the conductor that interact with magnetic fields generated by magnets that are mounted to the frame. The diaphragm is driven by a motive force created when current passes through the conductor within the magnetic field. The electrical current is varied to create an acoustical output from the electro-dynamic loudspeaker. Different frame structures are provided for simplifying the manufacturing process and defining a reduced cost electro-dynamic loudspeaker.

   Methods and apparatuses negate a measured mechanical twist of an optical fiber by introducing a counteracting twist to bring the net mechanical twist closer to zero, which reduces the fiber's polarization mode dispersion (PMD). A spool of optical fiber having undesirable mechanical twist is mounted and fiber is drawn from the end of the spool to impart a specified counteracting mechanical twist. Additionally, the spool may be controllably rotated by a control system while optical fiber is drawn there from, allowing the system to generate a precise amount of counteracting mechanical twist in the fiber.

A gas tube voltage protection subassembly (42) of each protector assembly is connected electrically to a grounding subassembly (44) for causing current associated with excessive voltage surges to be conducted to ground. A first electrode includes a portion which extends through annular dielectric and metallic members and an opening of an open-ended metallic container (93) to engage a shunting element (62) of a current protection subassembly (41). The superimposed annular members are held in engagement with the first electrode at a substantially constant pressure by axial forces applied by turned-in portions (109--109) of a side wall of the metallic container. The shunting element is supported at one end of the line pin in an initial position by a fusible material. A spring (43) between the container of the voltage protection subassembly and the housing maintains the voltage protection subassembly in engagement with the shunting element. When current flow exceeds a predetermined level that is sufficient to melt the fusible material, the spring is effective to cause the shunting element to be moved to engage the grounding subassembly to establish a fault current path to ground. The excess voltage arcs across the wide gap to ground, or in the event that a gas in the gap has vented, the voltage arcs across openings in the dielectric member to ground in a fail-safe mode.",AMERICAN TELEPHONE & TELEGRAPH,AMEIN JOHN M;;GARNER FLOYD J;;HORNE III E WALTON;;LEVANDOSKI RAYMOND A;;MCGONIGAL CHARLES;;SWEATT ROBERT L,AT&T TECHNOLOGIES INC (1986-12-19),https://lens.org/144-278-827-230-241,Granted Patent,yes,17,21,1,1,0,H01T1/14;;H01T1/14;;H01T4/06;;H01T4/06,H01T1/14;;H01T4/06,361/128;;361/120;;361/124;;361/119;;361/130;;337/28;;337/32,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
