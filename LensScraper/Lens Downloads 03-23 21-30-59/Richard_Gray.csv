    A massive choke coil e.g. exceeding about three henries, with at least a thousand turns and a relatively low internal resistance of about eleven ohms placed in parallel with the A/C line, that is, preferably across the A/C line's hot and common lines, quenching the reflected signal (or back emf) that is developed when any power amplifier or other load places its demands upon the incoming A/C power line. Due to its electromagnetic characteristics, the choke tends to provide a momentary high current source of energy when needed by, e.g., a power amplifier (or other appropriate load) when transient demand is called for. The parallel choke approach tends to have a reversing effect on this signal, at least substantially reducing its presence on the A/C line, providing a greatly enhanced A/C power line signal quality, without which the otherwise untreated signals are able to modulate the A/C line.

May 8, 1950, No. 11455/50. Class 40 (iii). A television receiver for use in a system of secret television wherein the television signal radiated to the receiver is coded by varying the time relationship between the picture and linesynchronizing signals in accordance with a key signal which is transmitted to the receiver by a second channel, and comprising means for decoding the received signals by varying the timing of the line-scanning waveform at the receiver in accordance with the key signals, comprises means for generating blanking pulses in synchronism with the scanning waveform to blank the edges of the reproduced picture which would otherwise exhibit an objectionable flicker. The television signals are received upon aerial 1, detected at 2, amplified at 3 and thence applied to cathode-ray tube 6. Synchronizing signals are separated from the received signal by circuit 7, the frame synchronizing signals being applied to frame-scanning generator 8 and the line-synchronizing signals being applied via a circuit 10 to the line-scanning generator 13. Key signals received from the co-operating transmitter are applied via terminals 11 to circuit 12 which controls .a switching operation in the circuit 10 to introduce at appropriate times into the circuit of the line-synchronizing pulses a delay line to compensate for similar delay effects introduced during the coding operation at the transmitter. Owing to the periodic changing of the timing of the linescanning waveform with respect to the received synchronizing and pedestal pulses a flickering effect would be produced, with the apparatus so far described, at the edges of the reproduced picture. To remove this effect, pulses from the line-scanning generator 13 are applied to circuit 15 which comprises phase-shifting and pulseshaping circuits to produce blanking signals, synchronized with the line-scanning waveform and completely encompassing the pedestal pulses associated with the line-synchronizing pulses whether or not the scanning waveform is delayed with respect to the picture signals.",ZENITH RADIO CORP,GRAY RICHARD OWEN,,https://lens.org/139-049-514-119-913,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,4,0,H04N7/1693;;H04N7/16,H04N7/16;;H04N7/169,H4F FD13A         4-;;H4F FD69          4-;;H4F FD71          4-,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A CCFL in a direct driven CCFL circuit that is difficult to strike can appear to be malfunctioning using a standard start up operation. A controlled start up allows additional opportunities for a slow striking CCFL to strike. In one embodiment, the CCFL of the direct drive CCFL circuit can be initially driven at a switching frequency substantially different than a resonant frequency. Based on certain conditions, the switching frequency can subsequently be allowed to approach resonant frequency in a controlled manner. If the driving frequency reaches the resonant frequency of the CCFL during a set time period, then the CCFL can enter into steady state operation.

Plies picked singly and successively from the top of their respective stacks are deposited side by side on a reciprocable support maintaining their relative positions during transfer to a series of holders aligned heightwise with ply-receiving pallets constituting an intermittently operable endless conveyor. The support and holders cooperate to reposition the plies, if need be, on the holders. The arrangement is such that indexing the pallets continuously accumulates in registered, superposed relation the required number of plies of an assembly.

The modulator of the invention includes a saturable medium which is capable of amplifying an optical signal by stimulated emission of radiation. Two optical signals, in the form of two light beams are caused to pass through the medium and to emerge from the medium in amplified form. The beams, however, are caused to have different gains in the medium either by causing the beams to have different path lengths, or by other means. The beams are intercoupled by cross-saturation of the medium. Thus, any variations in the intensity of one of the beams causes a change in intensity in the other beam. Since one of the beams has a greater gain than the other, a small change in the intensity of one of the beams will produce a large change in the intensity of the other beam, thus producing in many aspects the optical analog of the transistor.

The device comprises a power module (10), a LED string (20), a current source (30) and a controller (440). The LED string (30) has multiple LED diodes connected in series that forms a major segment (200) and multiple minor segments (220). The controller (440) is connected to the current source (30) and the LED string (20), which selectively shorts (460) the LED diodes of the minor segments. Since the number of LED diodes of the LED string is adaptively adjusted in response to the voltage across the current source (30), the voltage across the current source can be maintained in a range that is close to the minimum working voltage of the current source, thus the power efficiency is improved under a wide range of operating conditions.

The specially formulated epoxy adhesive contains a cross-linkable epoxy novolac resin, an epoxy reactive diluent, and an imidazole curing agent substituted in at least one position with an alkyl or a hydroxyalkyl group. The amount of the curing agent used in the formulation is much lower than that in a conventional two-part epoxy adhesive such that the adhesive will not attack or degrade the primer layer to weaken the bond strength. The reactive diluent used reduces the viscosity of the mixed adhesive system to facilitate dispersion and wetting of the adhesive on the coated steel surface.

A pleated membrane filter cartridge 14 is provided in the test housing 12 and pressurized water flows in the test housing 12 to collide with the whole surface of the porous membrane within a filter cartridge 14. A pleated cartridge structure is collapsed when exposed to applied test pressure and the vol. within the cartridge filter 14 is increased by the compression of pleats. The expansion of the air space 20 caused by the collapse of pleats brings about a pressure drop and this state is detected by the monitor 22 attached to the wall of the container 11 to generate a water flow rate signal.,MILLIPORE CORP,DILEO ANTHONY J;;GRAY RICHARD W,,https://lens.org/057-818-739-662-061,Patent Application,no,0,3,8,8,0,B01D65/102;;B01D65/102;;B01D65/102;;G01N15/0826;;G01N15/0826;;G01N15/0826;;G01N15/088;;G01N15/088;;G01N15/088,B01D65/10;;G01N15/08,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The apparatus includes a transfer fabric which supports and advances the cellulose web to a wind up zone. The transfer fabric forms a closed loop and is driven at a desired speed by a drive roll. At least two spray nozzles are arranged transversely across the advancing cellulose web as it is carried on the transfer fabric. The spray nozzles are capable of emitting a liquid under high pressure against the advancing cellulose web to form perforations across the width thereof. A plurality of hollow cores are independently and sequentially moved into position at the wind up zone to receive the advancing cellulose web. The hollow cores are located downstream of the spray nozzles and each hollow core is capable of accumulating a predetermined amount of the cellulose web. The apparatus further includes controls for activating the spray nozzles in timed sequence to the speed of the transfer fabric such that a predetermined amount of cellulose web can be accumulated on each hollow core to form a finished roll having a predetermined diameter. An assembly is also present for moving each of the finished rolls away from the advancing cellulose web while simultaneously moving a second hollow core into contact with the advancing cellulose web upstream of the finished roll. The contact by the second hollow core and the employment of vacuum increases the tension on the advancing cellulose web and causes the advancing cellulose web to cleanly break at the perforations and form a leading edge. A vacuum is then applied to the second hollow core which causes the leading edge of the advancing cellulose web to wrap onto it. The method encompasses the sequential steps required to break the advancing cellulose web using the above-identified apparatus.,KIMBERLY CLARK CO,GRAY ROBERT LEE;;HORTON RICHARD AMES,,https://lens.org/030-963-604-480-069,Patent Application,no,0,0,2,2,0,B65H19/267;;B65H19/267;;B65H2301/51514;;B65H2301/51514;;B65H2301/5152;;B65H2301/5152;;B65H2301/51534;;B65H2301/51534;;Y10T225/12;;Y10T225/12;;Y10T225/314;;Y10T225/314,B65H19/26,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The transfer fabric forms a closed loop and is driven at a desired speed by a drive roll. At least two spray nozzles are arranged transversely across the advancing cellulose web as it is carried on the transfer fabric. The spray nozzles are capable of emitting a liquid under high pressure against the advancing cellulose web to form perforations across the width thereof. A plurality of hollow cores are independently and sequentially moved into position at the wind up zone to receive the advancing cellulose web. The hollow cores are located downstream of the spray nozzles and each hollow core is capable of accumulating a predetermined amount of the cellulose web. The apparatus further includes controls for activating the spray nozzles in timed sequence to the speed of the transfer fabric such that a predetermined amount of cellulose web can be accumulated on each hollow core to form a finished roll having a predetermined diameter. An assembly is also present for moving each of the finished rolls away from the advancing cellulose web while simultaneously moving a second hollow core into contact with the advancing cellulose web upstream of the finished roll. The contact by the second hollow core and the employment of vacuum increases the tension on the advancing cellulose web and causes the advancing cellulose web to cleanly break at the perforations and form a leading edge. A vacuum is then applied to the second hollow core which causes the leading edge of the advancing cellulose web to wrap onto it. The method encompasses the sequential steps required to break the advancing cellulose web using the above-identified apparatus.,KIMBERLY CLARK CO,GRAY ROBERT LEE;;HORTON RICHARD AMES,KIMBERLY-CLALRK WORLDWIDE INC (1999-03-16),https://lens.org/138-467-948-411-490,Granted Patent,yes,16,12,2,2,0,B65H19/267;;B65H19/267;;B65H2301/51514;;B65H2301/51514;;B65H2301/5152;;B65H2301/5152;;B65H2301/51534;;B65H2301/51534;;Y10T225/12;;Y10T225/12;;Y10T225/314;;Y10T225/314,B65H19/26,225/2;;162/194;;162/286;;225/95;;242/521;;242/522;;242/533.3;;242/531,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES, Ltd., Jan. 6, 1948, No. 428. [Class 40 (iv)] [Also in Group XL (c)] Carrier current is modulated by a signal voltage by applying a sine-wave or squarewave carrier to the grid of a valve arranged to discharge a condenser once per carrier cycle, the condenser having been charged to a voltage dependent on the signal voltage whilst the valve was blocked. The complex wave represented by the condenser voltage, or discharge current, is passed to line by a filter selecting the fundamental or an harmonic. Several signals may be sent simultaneously over a single line by the use of different carrier frequencies, which may be spaced 100 cycles apart in the neighbourhood of 1000 cycles per second. The signals may represent co-ordinates for deflecting the beam of a cathode-ray oscillograph in a radio direction-indicating system. Alternatively the signals may be telegraphic ; or if the carrier frequencies are suitably raised, telephonic channels may be provided. As shown in Fig. 3, the carrier from a source 42 is applied to the grid of a triode valve 39 so that the wave crests discharge a condenser 44 which had been charged through a resistor 40 by the signal voltage applied at terminals 5, 9. A modulated saw-tooth carrier is taken off through a condenser 46. In a modification (Fig. 4, not shown), the modulated carrier is taken off across a resistor, which is connected between cathode and earth and may have a condenser across it. Four such carriers may be taken from four separate modulators through isolating resistors and combined in an output resistor, from which they are fed to an amplifier 52, Fig. 5. A band-pass output filter 19 may be connected in the cathode lead, or it may be transformer-coupled to the anode lead (Fig. 6, not shown). A mixing condenser may be substituted for the isolating and combining resistors. The filter may be designed to pass to line the fundamentals or selected harmonics of the carriers. At the receiving station, the carriers are separated by band-pass filters and are passed to separate amplifiers and detectors.

As the substrate (11) moves through the chambers (28,30,32), it assumes a normal, elongated path of travel. Due to elevated deposition temperature, elongated path of travel, gravity, etc., the web (11) has a tendency to warp. Warpage of the web (11) promotes the deposition of non-uniform semiconductor alloy layers. To avoid this, there is established by means (50) at least one magnetic field within each deposition chamber (28,30,32) which field is adapted to urge the substrate (11) into a flat, substantially planar path of travel.

As the web of the substrate material moves through the deposition chambers, it assumes a normal, elongated path of travel. Due to the elevated deposition temperature, the elongated path of travel, the force of gravity, etc., the web has a tendency to warp. Warpage of the web is undesirable as it promotes the deposition of non-uniform semiconductor alloy layers. The improvement of the present invention contemplates the establishment of at least one magnetic field within each deposition chamber which is adapted to urge the web of substrate material out of its normal path of travel into a flat, substantially planar path of travel. The new flat path of travel serves to substantially reduce warpage of the web which permits uniform amorphous semiconductor alloy layers to be deposited.

The invention achieves this by measuring the analyte under investigation in a time dependent (bio-/immuno-) chemical reaction and measuring separately, a marker substance (e.g haemoglobin) for the estimation of red blood cell volume, using a non-time-dependent alteration in physical property of the reaction mixture (in this instance, transmission) attributed to inherent filter effects on sample addition. These non-time-dependent changes are not part of the reaction chemistry, and are resolved from the time dependent alteration in physical property caused by the assay chemistry by continuous measurement and mathematical modelling. Algorithms that combine these two parameters are used to estimate the target substance and compensate for variations in the percentage haematocrit of the sample.

As the web of the substrate material moves through the deposition chambers, it assumes a normal, elongated path of travel. Due to the elevated deposition temperature, the elongated path of travel, the force of gravity, etc., the web has a tendency to warp. Warpage of the web is undesirable as it promotes the deposition of non-uniform semiconductor alloy layers. The improvement of the present invention contemplates the establishment of at least one magnetic field within each deposition chamber which is adapted to urge the web of substrate material out of its normal path of travel into a flat, substantially planar path of travel. The new flat path of travel serves to substantially reduce warpage of the web which permits uniform amorphous semiconductor alloy layers to be deposited. In alternate embodiments, the web of substrate material may be urged into sliding contact with a plurality of stationary ceramic magnets or the web may be urged into rolling contact with a plurality of rotatable magnetic elements which may either be hollow, ceramic magnets or electromagnets.",ENERGY CONVERSION DEVICES INC,DOEHLER JOACHIM;;CANNELLA VINCENT;;GRAY RICHARD O JR,,https://lens.org/196-732-478-503-603,Granted Patent,no,0,0,18,18,0,C23C16/545;;H01J37/3277;;H01J37/34;;H01L21/67709;;H01L21/6776;;H01L21/67709;;H01J37/34;;H01L21/6776;;H01J37/3277;;C23C16/545,C23C16/54;;H01L31/04;;H01J37/34;;H01L21/205;;H01L21/677,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
