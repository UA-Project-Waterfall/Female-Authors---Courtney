May 16. Time-checking apparatus for workmen. Relates to the type-wheel mechanism of workmen's timerecorders and the like. Units' and tens' minuteprinting wheels 1, 2, Figs. 1 and 2, and an hourprinting wheel 3, are provided, on a spindle 7. The wheel 1 is fast on the spindle 7, and is driven continuously through a loose pinion 5 and a connexion comprising two lugs 10 on a wheel 8, fixed to the wheel 1, and an arm 9, fixed to the pinion 5. One lug 10 is maintained against the arm 9 by means of a spring 12, and the wheel 1 has freedom of movement limited by the second lug. The wheel 2 is fast on a sleeve 18, geared to a spindle 15, driven from two teeth 13 on the wheel 8 through a pinion 14. The teeth 13 are at twenty-tooth pitch, and the space between them is cut away across the rim of the wheel 8. The pinion 14 has eight teeth, alternately long and short, and two of the long teeth lock against the rim of the wheel 8, except when the teeth 13 co-operate. The wheel 3 is similarly driven by means of a toothed wheel 19, a loose pinion 23, and a wheel 20 having two pairs of teeth 21, 22. The type-wheel gearing allows of forward and backward rotation for setting the bands of the clock. The spindle 15 is mounted in bearings 26 in adjustable pieces 27, Figs. 2 and 4, pivoted on screws 28 and secured by pins 29. Alinement of the wheel 1 is obtained by means of a ratchet-wheel 30, Figs. 1, 2, and 4, and a pawl 37 on a lever 31, limited by a stop 41. The pawl 37 is on a pivoted piece 36 retained by a spring 43, The lever 31 is, normally, held away from the ratchet-wheel, against the action of a spring 33, by means of a rod 46, which 'is provided with an adjustable block 44, engaging with a pin 42 on the lever 31, and is slotted at the outer end over a pin 49, attached to a part having a motion suitable for bringing the pin 49 towards the lever 31 when alinement is required. Should the lever 31 be held in, the arm 9 will overtake the lug 10, the ratchetwheel 30 will run over the pawl 37, and the clock will not be stopped. receiver 3 projects through a slot in the top plate of the case, and has fixed to its front a plate with letters corresponding with those at the top of the card columns. The card receiver can be adjusted and locked in the required position. A bell 44 is rung when printing occurs, but not when the anvil 6 is struck. In a modified machine, the safety device comprising the anvil 6, the bent lever 5, and the transmission mechanism between these parts may be omitted.",DUNCAN JOHN,DUNCAN JOHN,,https://lens.org/059-813-722-778-754,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

May 16. T i m e - checking apparatus for workmen. A card machine in which the record is made by the turning of a handle, in which no record is possible unless the card is properly placed in the machine slot, in which the card platform can be ad-- justed if the clock runs down, and in which tampering with the mechanism through the operating-handle is prevented, is shown in sectional elevations in Figs. 1 and 2. The driving - clock, the type-wheels and the method of driving them, and the inking-arrangements are ordinary. If the card 1 is not in its proper position in the receiver 3, the anvil 6 instead of the card takes the blow of the printing- hammer 31. This is effected through the bent lever 5, mounted on the card platform 4 being allowed to move too far, past the lower edge of the card, so raising the anvil 6 into position to receive the hammer blow. The transmission mechanism between the card platform and the anvil comprises a crank 18 on the spindle 15, forming the pivot of the lever 5, and a rod 20, and cranks 21. The card receiver 3 has free horizontal movement by means of a slide on the guide-rods 8. The card platform 4 is guided vertically on the rods 12, and is raised at definite intervals by mechanism controlled by the clock. A projecting piece on the platform 4 rests on the upper edge of a lifting-frame 52, which . is raised by the chain 56 secured to the pulley 59. This pulley runs loose on the spindle 60, and is driven by the disk 61. The spindle 60 is operated once in twelve hours ; and every half revolution of a two-toothed wheel 72 passes one of fourteen slots in the wheel 70 and rotates the chain-pulley 59 through one-fourteenth of a revolution. To raise the platform 4 by hand, the spindle 81 is brought through the clock face. To indicate which card row is opposite the type-wheels, a circular dayindicator 82 is provided.

Time-checking apparatus for workmen. Relates to an automatically-reversible driving-gear for the - ink-ribbons of typewriting-machines, time-recording machines, and the like. One end of the ribbon is attached to a reel D which can be driven in either direction by means of a mitre wheel, which can gear with either of twowheels B<1>, B<2> on a shaft S, intermittently rotated by a ratchet-wheel W and pawl or other means. The other end of the ribbon is attached to a reel T, to the spindle V of which is fixed one end of a spring 0 which tends to wind the ribbon on to the reel T. To prevent the reel D from being rotated by the pull of the spring 0, the reel is braked by the action of a spring S<2> which presses the boss of the wheel B<3> against the framework, The feed of the ribbon is reversed by means of a lever L, mounted on a pivot 2 and having a forked end which rests between two collars 4 on the shaft S. The lever L is held in its extreme positions by locking-levers L<1>, which can engage with pins P on the lever L and are pulled towards each other by a spring L<2>. In line with the spindle of the reel D is mounted a spindle R carrying a mitre wheel B<4> which can gear with either of the wheels B<1>, B<3>. The spindle R is threaded and on it travels a block B, to which is secured a rod 7 having slotted ends which engage with pins 8, 9 on the levers L<1>. The lever L is provided with forked arms 10 which embrace the spindle R, and between the block B and the arms 10 are placed springs 12, 13. When the block B reaches the upper or lower limit of its travel on the spindle R, the rod 7 moves the locking-lever L<1> which is in engagement with its pin P, and one of the springs 12, 13 rocks the lever L. The shaft S is thereby moved longitudinally and the feed of the ribbon is reversed.",DUNCAN JOHN,DUNCAN JOHN,,https://lens.org/166-611-138-785-852,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   A package of tape including a plurality of body portions. Each body portion is formed as a series of steps, each step including a plurality of turns of tape that are wrapped about a core. During formation of each step, the winding position of the tape is varied. In one embodiment, the winding position of the tape is oscillated a fraction of the width of the tape per revolution of the core, or during a revolution of the core. In an alternative embodiment, the winding position of the tape is varied by a fraction of the width of the tape in a first direction after each approximately full turn of tape. During formation of an immediately adjacent step in the same body portion, the winding position of the tape is varied by a fraction of the width of the tape in a second direction, opposite the first direction.

It also provides a cold lower tank area that stays cooler than the bulk of the volume of the tank through the heating cycle. It also provides a cold lower tank area above the flue outlet of the remote heat exchanger further enhancing the efficiency. It also delivers hotter water to the top of the tank, thereby filling the tank with hot water from the top down. It also utilises the superior insulating properties of plastic foam. It also efficiently uses the pilot flame heat without it causing a high airflow through the unit, with attendant thermal losses. The tank unit is easily replaced in the event of a tank leak or rupture, but retaining the gas equipment and heat exchanger for further use. The central flue has been deleted, and the products of combustion are now directed up the outside of the tank surface in a gap provided between the tank outer wall and a metal sheet wrap to keep the hot gases against the tank wall. Two or more separate fluid paths that are in good mutual contact for efficient heat transfer. The fluid paths are generally tubular and the length of the tubing on one side of the heat exchanger carrying a first fluid may be shorter or longer than that for the second fluid.

Next, standardized values for each of the one or more variables are defined. In turn, the analysis confidence, e.g. mined, ore quality, etc., of the one or more sub-volumes is mathematically determined. Finally, the model is updated to include the determined analysis confidence of the one or more sub-volumes.

The chamber is covered by a circular lid that prevents flow of steam directly vertically up a tube from the chamber. At the end of a normal heating cycle, the temperature of the body rises rapidly and power supplied to a heating element is automatically turned off under the control of a thermostat. The heating arrangement is used without alteration (e.g. to the setting of the thermostat) to keep-warm hot coffee in a lower container after the end of the normal heating coffee-making cycle. The effect of having the lid is that during a keep-warm function, the reservoir is generally starved of liquid because any liquid entering the reservoir is immediately evaporated and this restricts flow of more liquid into the reservoir and hence starves the reservoir.",CHIAPHUA IND LTD,MCNAIR JOHN DUNCAN,CHIAPHUA INDUSTRIES LIMITED (1997-03-24),https://lens.org/082-925-385-256-946,Granted Patent,yes,6,2,5,5,0,A47J31/047;;A47J31/047,A47J31/047,219/438;;219/440;;219/431;;219/432;;99/292,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A coffee machine has a space for receiving coffee grounds. Pressurised fluid is forced into the space. There is a filter screen against which the coffee grounds bear in use and through which coffee-infused fluid from the space passes to be dispensed. A fluid-pervious piston is located within the space and moves toward the filter screen to thereby compress the coffee grounds in use. This prevents the coffee grounds from separating from one another in which case the pressurised fluid might take a path of least resistance, not necessarily an infusion path through the grounds.

The reference signal component of the amplified signal is then isolated and a comparison is made, either with the actual reference signal, e.g., by a QAM demodulator, or alternatively with the known frequency of the reference signal, e.g., by a FM discriminator, in order to determine the differences in gain and in phase of the reference signal component of the amplified signal in comparison with the reference signal. For example, a QAM demodulator is used for producing a first difference signal indicative of the phase switch difference, and a second difference signal indicative of the gain switch difference.

De-icing aircraft. BRITISH AIRCRAFT CORPORATION (OPERATING) Ltd. Sept. 16, 1965 [June 23, 1964], No. 25933/64. Heading B7W. [Also in Division F1] Apparatus for de-icing aircraft comprises a small-bore tube, e.g. # inch diameter, embedded in a surface to be de-iced and connected in the circuit of an hydraulic control circuit operating at high pressure, e.g. 4000 p.s.i., whereby the heat generated by the flow of liquid through the tube is adequate to remove or prevent the formation of ice. A pump 25 delivers hydraulic oil through pipe 27 to operate flying controls and through priority valve 29 and pipe 28 to operate an undercarriage and, through a further priority valve 26 and solenoid operated valve 12, to supply oil to a small bore pipe or pipes 10 buried in a surface to be de-iced, the oil returning to a tank 32 through a pressuremaintaining valve 13, filter 36 and oil cooler 31, which are arranged in parallel with a thermostatically-controlled by-pass 33 and a pressure limiting by-pass 34. A switch 16 responsive to the differential pressure across valve 13 is connected to solenoid 22 through a normally closed manually operated switch 24 and a normally open manually operated switch 23. In operation, de-icing is initiated by closure of switch 23, the resulting presaure difference across valve 13 closing switch 16 to complete the circuit from voltage input 19 to solenoid 22, thereby permitting release of switch 23. De-icing is terminated by closure of switch 24. Should tube 10 be damaged, e.g. by impact, valves 12 and 13 would be operated automatically by a presiure-drop to isolate the de-icing part of the hydraulic circuit.

Shutters with pivoting blades.-In a shutter with two symmetrically pivoted blades 25<a>, 25<b>, Fig. 2, the blades are actuated by a helical spring 36<a>, 36<b> passing around and secured at its midposition 35 to a segmental member 33, Fig. 5, which is concentrically mounted relatively to the lens opening and adapted to be rotated and locked in position to put either section of the spring under tension. When the blades are free and neither spring is tensioned. the shutter is set by first moving a finger 17 along an arcuate slot 14, Fig. 1, in the front plate 1, say in a clockwise direction, thereby rotating the member 33 clockwise, tensioning the spring 36<a>, and operating the blades through the levers 28, 30<a> so that the projection 32<a> on the blade 25<a> snaps behind the retainiug-end 39<a> of the spring 38. The finger 17 is then moved in a contrary direction into the opposite sector of the slot 14 in order to tension the spring 36<b>. The shutter is released by the slide 42, which has arms 41 to retract the spring plate 38 from the projection 39<a>. The blades swing across the shutter, and the projection 32<b> on the blade 25<b> subsequently snaps behind the other end 39<b> of the spring 38. The exposure is determined by the degree of tension on the spring 36<b>, and the finger 17 is held in any position along the arcuate slot 14 by an auxiliary spring finger 19 which engages slots 16. For the next exposure the finger 17 is moved to the opposite section of the slot 14.

   The invention describes a heat exchanger that continuously and passively regulates the transfer of heat across each part of the heat exchanger's partitions. Such partitions composed of typically two tubes, one inside the other's bore, that at various points, contact each other or separate from each other, thereby increasing or decreasing heat transfer across their walls at those points. Such separations and contacts being spontaneously effected by changes in the shape of at least one of the tubes which is driven by elements connected to that tube and which change their shape in response to temperature changes, such as shape memory alloys (SMA's) or bi-metal strips.

Duncan, J. P. Feb. 1. Embossing.-Relates to mill engraving in which the different depth of design is obtained by the more or less frequent passage of the mill over the surface of the roller or block, and consists in providing automatic mechanical means for oscillating the roller in contact with the mill. A roller A is driven by spur-wheels A<3>, A<2> from a wheel A' on a shaft a carrying a bevelwheel C<3> gearing with wheels C<1>, C<2>, either of which may be clutched to the driving-shaft B<1> by a clutch C. The clutch C is operated by a fork c, a lever L<1> pivoted at l, and a connecting-rod L, from a bell-crank k, the slotted end K of which engages a pin i<2> in a rod i<1> attached to the carriage I. The carriage I is supported by rods i which slide in the stationary end frames d<x>. Resting in notches in the ends of the carriage I are a series (in this case two) of bars H each carrying two adjustable stops G, G' adapted to be engaged by a cross-head D' carried by a rack D reciprocated by gearing F<1>, F<2>, F<3>, a shaft E<2>, bevel-gearing E, E<1>, and a shaft D<2>, from . the shaft a. The bars H when in the operative position are supported on two segments M, each provided with a notch m into which one bar H is adapted to drop out of action at a point determined by stops O on a ratchet bar N<3> fed forward by a pawl N<2>, Figs. 2 and 4. The pawl N<2> is pivoted on an eccentric pin n<2> on a catch N pivoted on a bar secured to the stationary end frame d<x>. At each movement of the cross-head D<3> to the right, a catch I<1> engages the catch N and feeds the bar N' along until the first stop O engages a stop on the segment M and rocks it, so that the first bar H drops into the notch m out of action. When the second stop O engages the segment, it is further rocked, causing the second bar to fall out of action and-leaving the clutch mechanism to be controlled by stops G<2>, G<3> on the bar H<1> of the carriage I. A weighted cord or a helical spring attached to an eye N<4> in the ratchet bar N<3> tends to return the bar N<3>, but is normally prevented from doing so by a retaining-pawl N<5>. Both the pawls N<2>, N<5> are disengaged to return the bar N<3> by a projection q on a spring-held lever Q. The bars H are raised to the operative position again by pins R projecting laterally from two bars R', vertically movable by means of two bell-cranks and a longitudinally sliding rod S<1> operated by suitable means, shown in Fig. 1. In order to stop the apparatus, preferably in the mid-stroke of the cross-head D', an adjustable stop P, Fig. 2, secured to the bar N<3> engages a projection P' on a lever P<2>, pivoted to a stud p on the carriage I. The lever P<2> is thus lifted and the end p<1> of the projection P' intercepts the cross-head D<3> when the crosshead is moving towards the left, whereby the lever P<2> is carried along until its end p<3> abuts against the stop p<4>, taking with it the carriage I. In this position the rod i<1> moves the clutch C into mid-position, thus stopping the apparatus. In order to permit movement of the cylinder A without disturbing the controlling- mechanism, the bevel-gear E<1> is connected to its shaft E<2> by a clutch E<x>.",DUNCAN JOHN PINKERTON,DUNCAN JOHN PINKERTON,,https://lens.org/075-082-610-672-385,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   An electrical pressure sensing switch for a pressure cooker comprises a plunger slidably and sealingly mounted in a lid of a cooking vessel. The plunger is moved towards one end of a pivoted lever when pressure rises inside the vessel. The other end of the lever is positioned to press down against an operating arm. When the force applied by the plunger as a result of higher pressures in the vessel is sufficient to overcome bias of a spring , the arm is moved down by the lever. This results in operation of micro-switches Embodiments of the invention are mechanically simple and accommodate wide tolerances without loss of calibration, while necessary electrical parts are separated or separable from the lid to facilitate cleaning and washing.

At the handover depth, tension is applied via a wire to the top of the pipe string at an acute angle to the launch axis. This deflects the pipe string from the launch axis into axial alignment with the wire to transfer the weight load of the pipe string to the wire, whereupon the abandonment string can be decoupled from the pipe string.

The effect of having the lid 19 is that during a keep-warm function, the reservoir is generally starved of liquid because any liquid entering the reservoir is immediately evaporated and this restricts flow of more liquid into the reservoir and hence starves the reservoir.",CHIAPHUA IND LTD,MCNAIR JOHN DUNCAN,,https://lens.org/013-632-702-050-932,Patent Application,no,2,4,5,5,0,A47J31/047;;A47J31/047,A47J31/047,A4E E106          EY;;A4E E132          EY;;A4E E150          EY,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Centrifugal pumps.-Relates to a condensing system suitable for places where economy in the use of water is necessary, rendering it desirable to use the water over and over again continuously, and one of the chief objects is to arrange so that all the requisite pumping is performed by a single pump. Fig. 7 shows in diagrammatic form an example of the apparatus complete. In this, a denotes a cooling-tower or other cooling-device, b the condenser supplied with condensing water by the injection pipe 2, 1 the pipe delivering steam to be condensed into the condenser, and c the combined air and circulating pump by which air, vapour, and water are withdrawn from the condenser, and the whole body of water is kept circulating through the pipes 4, 5 and the cooler a. Fig. 1 shows in section one form of jet condenser and pump, and Fig. 3 shows the pump in section. The pump is a double centrifugal pump with a set of blades f<1> for drawing from the suction chamber k which communicates with the pipe 5, and a set of vertical tubes i for drawing from a central cavity f<2> in the boss f which communicates with the condenser b. Each of the tubes i is formed with a contracted portion i<1> designed to facilitate the flow of water through them. The pump casing consists of two heads j', j' and a peripheral ring j forming the discharge chamber and connected with the pipe 4. The pump casing is connected with the condenser by aT-pipe h forming a stuffing-box surrounding an extension g of the boss f. The packing is adjusted by a sliding sleeve or gland h<4> prevented from rotating by a pin and adjusted by a central screw h'. In place of a jet condenser, an induction condenser may be employed, as shown in Fig. 8. In this, the steam to be condensed enters at 1 and the condensing water at 2, and the pump is constructed to draw from only one source. A similar pump drawing from two sources on one side is also shown.",MCRAE JOHN DUNCAN,MCRAE JOHN DUNCAN,,https://lens.org/051-895-946-446-186,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The control arrangement makes use of a reference signal, of known frequency, which is amplified along with the desired carrier signals. The reference signal component of the amplified signal is then isolated and a comparison is made, either with the actual reference signal, e.g., by a QAM demodulator, or alternatively with the known frequency of the reference signal, e.g., by a FM discriminator, in order to determine the differences in gain and in phase of the reference signal component of the amplified signal in comparison with the reference signal.

    An electrical pressure sensing switch for a pressure cooker comprises a plunger slidably and sealingly mounted in a lid of a cooking vessel. The plunger is moved towards one end of a pivoted lever when pressure rises inside the vessel. The other end of the lever is positioned to press down against an operating arm. When the force applied by the plunger as a result of higher pressures in the vessel is sufficient to overcome bias of a spring, the arm is moved down by the lever. This results in operation of micro-switches. Embodiments of the invention are mechanically simple and accommodate wide tolerances without loss of calibration, while necessary electrical parts are separated or separable from the lid to facilitate cleaning and washing.

    To accommodate for a release of uncleared spectrum in a wideband communication system (  10  ) while improving isolation in a receiver (FIG.  4  ) between wideband carriers, a common intermediate frequency converter down-converts differing but relatively high frequency carriers, incident to the receiver, to corresponding differing but relatively low frequency carriers. Receiver chains (  174-176  ) response to the plurality of relatively low frequency carriers each have a filter (  140-144  ) arranged to isolate selected ones of the relatively low frequency carriers. In a radio frequency communication system having three or more frequency sequential carriers, the receiver chains (  174-176  ) may include branches that have filters that further isolate carriers within the receiver by applying non-sequential carriers to the branches in each receiver chain.

It also provides a cold lower tank area that stays cooler than the bulk of the volume of the tank through the heating cycle. It also provides a cold lower tank area above the flue outlet of the remote heat exchanger further enhancing the efficiency. It also delivers hotter water to the top of the tank, thereby filling the tank with hot water from the top down. It also utilises the superior insulating properties of plastic foam. It also efficiently uses the pilot flame heat without it causing a high airflow through the unit, with attendant thermal losses. The tank unit is easily replaced in the event of a tank leak or rupture, but retaining the gas equipment and heat exchanger for further use. The central flue has been deleted, and the products of combustion are now directed up the outside of the tank surface in a gap provided between the tank outer wall and a metal sheet wrap to keep the hot gases against the tank wall. Two or more separate fluid paths that are in good mutual contact for efficient heat transfer. The fluid paths are generally tubular and the length of the tubing on one side of the heat exchanger carrying a first fluid may be shorter or longer than that for the second fluid. 2, 1,19 F G2~4-3",RHEEM AUSTRALIA PTY LTD,MCNAIR JOHN DUNCAN,,https://lens.org/017-042-649-330-50X,Limited Patent,no,0,2,3,3,0,,F24H1/41;;F24H1/14;;F24H1/34,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The reference signal component of the amplified signal is then isolated and a comparison is made, either with the actual reference signal, e.g., by a QAM demodulator, or alternatively with the known frequency of the reference signal, e.g., by a FM discriminator, in order to determine the differences in gain and in phase of the reference signal component of the amplified signal in comparison with the reference signal. For example, a QAM demodulator is used for producing a first difference signal indicative of the phase switch difference, and a second difference signal indicative of the gain switch difference. These signals are then correlated with the signal envelope of the main signal in order to produce signals indicative of the sign and magnitude of the control signals used to adjust the gain and phase adjuster in a feed back loop.",NORTHERN TELECOM LTD,MCNICOL JOHN DUNCAN,,https://lens.org/087-539-752-294-28X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,5,5,0,H03F1/3235;;H03F1/3247;;H03F1/3288;;H03F2200/102;;H03F2201/3212;;H03F2201/3221;;H03F2201/3233;;H03F1/3235;;H03F1/3247;;H03F2200/102;;H03F2201/3221;;H03F1/3288;;H03F2201/3212;;H03F2201/3233,H03F1/32,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

It also provides a cold lower tank area that stays cooler than the bulk of the volume of the tank through the heating cycle. It also provides a cold lower tank area above the flue outlet of the remote heat exchanger further enhancing the efficiency. It also delivers hotter water to the top of the tank, thereby filling the tank with hot water from the top down. It also utilises the superior insulating properties of plastic foam. It also efficiently uses the pilot flame heat without it causing a high airflow through the unit, with attendant thermal losses. The tank unit is easily replaced in the event of a tank leak or rupture, but retaining the gas equipment and heat exchanger for further use. The central flue has been deleted, and the products of combustion are now directed up the outside of the tank surface in a gap provided between the tank outer wall and a metal sheet wrap to keep the hot gases against the tank wall. Two or more separate fluid paths that are in good mutual contact for efficient heat transfer. The fluid paths are generally tubular and the length of the tubing on one side of the heat exchanger carrying a first fluid may be shorter or longer than that for the second fluid. iPi2 11",RHEEM AUSTRALIA PTY LTD,MCNAIR JOHN DUNCAN,,https://lens.org/164-653-794-176-644,Limited Patent,no,0,0,3,3,0,,F24H1/20;;F24D17/00;;F24H1/34,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

Complete cycles, partial cycles, and operation of the battery outside of acceptable specifications are automatically derived into a value in units equivalent to a number of battery cycles, and this derivation is compared with the manufacturers life expectancy, and adjustments to the manufacturers life expectancy are made so that a more accurate and up-to-date estimation of battery life can be evolved over the life of the battery. The monitoring device is mounted on the battery for the lifetime of the battery, with certain information regarding the battery being displayed to all persons having access to the battery.

A manufacturer's specified life expectancy, measured in battery cycles, is established for the battery under normal use, and then the actual use of the battery is monitored and stored. Complete cycles, partial cycles, and operation of the battery outside of acceptable specifications are automatically derived into a value in units equivalent to a number of battery cycles, and 10 this derivation is compared with the manufacturers life expectancy, and adjustments to the manufacturers life expectancy are made so that a more accurate and up-to-date estimation of battery life can be evolved over the life of the battery. The monitoring device is mounted on the battery for the lifetime of the battery, with certain information regarding the battery being displayed to all persons having access to the battery. 15 Additional information may be made available to an authorized person or entity. This enables a lessor of the battery, for example, to identify abuse of the battery by a lessee and adjust fees, lease terms, etc. accordingly.

The shaft 1 has a projection 6 at one end thereof which supports an end-wall 7 of a cover 8 and passes through an aperture in a mounting M. The shaft, wall 7 and mounting M assembly are clamped together by means of a nut N which is screwably tightened on a screw-threaded portion of the projection 6 so as to draw a shoulder of the shaft against the wall 7. The sleeve 2 has an end-wall 3 which carries a thrust-pin 5, the latter being engageable with an end 4 of the shaft and an end-wall 9 of the cover 8 so as to restrict axial movement of the sleeve. The cover is cut away so as to expose a large portion of the sleeve. The shaft is provided with a bore 11 which serves to equalize the pressures at opposite ends of the sleeve. In another embodiment a shaft comprises parts 20, 21 which are separated radially by means of resilient O-rings 24 being positioned in circumferential grooves 23 formed in the parts 20 and 21.

A manufacturer's specified life expectancy, measured in battery cycles, is established for the battery under normal use, and then the actual use of the battery is monitored and stored. Complete cycles, partial cycles, and operation of the battery outside of acceptable specifications are automatically derived into a value in units equivalent to a number of battery cycles, and this derivation is compared with the manufacturers life expectancy, and adjustments to the manufacturers life expectancy are made so that a more accurate and up-to-date estimation of battery life can be evolved over the life of the battery. The monitoring device is mounted on the battery for the lifetime of the battery, with certain information regarding the battery being displayed to all persons having access to the battery. Additional information may be made available to an authorized person or entity. This enables a lessor of the battery, for example, to identify abuse of the battery by a lessee and adjust fees, lease terms, etc. accordingly.",PHILADELPHIA SCIENT LLC,JOHN WORTHINGTON;;DUNCAN JONES,PHILADELPHIA SCIENTIFIC LLC (2012-09-06),https://lens.org/198-159-792-954-975,Granted Patent,no,1,0,8,8,0,G01R31/392;;G01R31/392,H02J7/00;;H02J7/16,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Molecules adsorb at surfaces in patterns, governed by the structure of the surface, the chemical nature of the adsorbate, and the adsorbate coverage at the surface. The surface is patterned and then imprinted with the pattern by inducing localized chemical reaction between adsorbate molecules and the surface of the solid, resulting in an imprint being formed in the vicinity of the adsorbate molecules. When the imprinted molecular patterns are conjugated chains containing π bonds along which electrical charge can flow the molecular patterns constitute molecular wires or the imprinted molecules constitute a molecular-scale device. The surface of the substrate can be doped by including n - or p- type dopants in the adsorbate molecules. These molecular wires are anchored to the substrate by using conjugated chains which can be chemically bound at intervals along the chains to the substrates.",POLANYI JOHN C;;ROGERS DUNCAN,POLANYI JOHN C;;ROGERS DUNCAN,,https://lens.org/075-127-442-291-749,Patent Application,yes,0,2,6,22,0,B82Y10/00;;B82Y40/00;;C23C14/048;;G03F7/0002;;G03F7/004;;G03F7/2043;;G03F7/2059;;H01L21/0277;;H01L21/2254;;B82Y10/00;;G03F7/004;;G03F7/2059;;G03F7/0002;;H01L21/2254;;G03F7/2043;;H01L21/0277;;C23C14/048;;B82Y40/00,G03F1/00;;C23C14/04;;G01N13/12;;G03F7/00;;G03F7/004;;G03F7/20;;H01L21/027;;H01L21/205;;H01L21/225,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Many compounds are claimed per se. The compounds may be prepared by: (1) Reacting a compound of the general formula <FORM:1070755/C2/2> in which Q represents a hydrogen or an alkali metal atom, preferably sodium or potassum with a haloformic acid ester of the formula (IV) Z.CO.OR where Z is chlorine, bromine or iodine, preferably chlorine, and R has the above-defined meaning, the reaction being effected in the presence of an acid binding agent, e.g. an alkali metal carbonate, an alkali metal bicarbonate or a tertiary amine (e.g. pyridine), where Q represents a hydrogen atom, preferably in solution in an inert organic solvent, e.g. a ketone such as acetone. The phenoxide of Formula (III) (where Q is an alkali metal) may be performed, or, preferably may be formed in situ in an inert organic solvent prior to introduction of the haloformic acid ester by reaction of the parent phenol <FORM:1070755/C2/3> with a suitable alkali metal compound, e.g. the hydroxide, carbonate or bi-carbonate. (2) The simultaneous reaction of the parent phenol (V) with a haloformic acid ester (IV) in an inert organic solvent (e.g. a ketone such as acetone) in the presence of an alkali metal carbonate or alkali metal bicarbonate, preferably an alkali metal carbonate. The haloformic acid esters (IV) may be prepared by reaction of a compound of the formula ROH with a compound of the formula COZ2 preferably in the presence of aluminium chloride as catalyst and where required in the presence of an acid binding agent. The invention also relates to the parent dinitro-alkyl phenols: <FORM:1070755/C2/4> in which R3 is a 1-n-propyl-n-butyl, 1-ethyl-n-pentyl, 1-n-butyl-pentyl, 1-n-propyl-n-hexyl, 1-n-butyl-n-hexyl, or 1-n-pentyl-n-hexyl group. Examples of compounds claimed per se are those in which R3 is 1-n-propyl-n-butyl, 1-ethyl-n-pentyl, 1-n-pentyl-n-hexyl. The compounds may be prepared by dinitration of the corresponding alkylphenols which may be prepared by reacting a p-hydroxybenzoketone with an appropriate alkylmagnesium halide, to yield a tertiary carbinol, dehydration of the carbinol, followed by catalytic hydrogenation of the resultant olefine, e.g. using palladium/charcoal in ethanol. Dehydration may occur spontaneously during heating or may be effected by the use of an acid catalyst, e.g. potassium hydrogen sulphate, p-toluene sulphonic acid or sulphuric acid. In an example, 2,6-di-nitro-4-(1-ethyl hexyl) phenyl ethyl carbonate is prepared by heating 2,6-di-nitro-4-(1-ethyl hexyl) phenol, carbonate and acetone and adding ethyl chloro formate.ALSO:Pesticidal compositions comprise as active ingredient one or more compounds of the general formula: <FORM:1070755/A5-A6/1> in which R is an alkyl group and R1 and R2 are n-alkyl groups containing from 2 to 5 carbon atoms each and together containing a total of 6 to 10 carbon atoms together with a solid or liquid diluent.

ENGLISH ELECTRIC CO. Ltd. March 13, 1964 [March 15, 1963], No.10386/63. Heading H2A. [Also in Division H1] A semi-conductor rectifier 16 is secured to a conductive mounting- plate 22 by bonding a cup shaped member 21 of thermally - conducting electrically insulating material such as beryllium oxide to both the rectifier and the plate. The cup is fitted over a mass 20 of metal which is secured to one of the rectifier terminals 19, and its base is secured directly to the mounting plate. In the example quoted, beryllium oxide, the cup is secured to both rectifier and plate by solder, its surface first being coated with tungsten iron or molybdenum manganese. The plate 22 is intended to be secured, e.g. by bolts 23, to a heat sink 13 which may be part of the casing of a transformer (Fig. 1, not shown) or electric machine with which the rectifier is associated. In particular the machine or transformer may be in an oil-filled casing and fins on the inside of the easing wall to which the rectifier is attached may be cooled by circulation of the oil over the fins. Fig. 1 (not shown) depicts six such rectifiers attached to the outside of such a casing wall and covered by a box-like attachment (15) which may be sealed to the casing. Such an arrangement may be employed in a so-called brushless dynamo-electric machine in which the rectifiers derive from an A.C. current in one winding a D.C. current for energizing another winding.",ENGLISH ELECTRIC CO LTD,MCCOLL JOHN DUNCAN;;JOHNSON ANTHONY,,https://lens.org/190-197-923-048-910,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,2,0,H01L23/473;;H01B3/004;;H01B3/025;;H01L25/03;;H01L2924/0002,H01B3/00;;H01B3/02;;H01L23/473;;H01L25/03,H1K KPDX          PDX;;H1K K1A1          PD;;H1K K5A           PD;;H1K K5A1          PD;;H1K K5A3          PD;;H1K K5D2          PD;;H1K K5D5          PD;;H1K K5EY          PD;;H1K K5E2          PD;;H1K K5M1          PD;;H1K K5PY          PD;;H1K K5P4U         PD;;H2A AKB           KB;;H2A A1C10A        -;;H2A A2E11         -;;H2A A2E18         A2E1;;H2A A2M           -;;H2A A24           A1C1,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A molecular-scale pattern of adsorbate molecules is used in place of the conventional macroscopic ""mask"". Molecules adsorb at surfaces in patterns, governed by the structure of the surface, the chemical nature of the adsorbate, and the adsorbate coverage at the surface. The surface is patterned and then marked or imprinted with the pattern by inducing localised chemical reaction between adsorbate molecules and the surface of the solid, resulting in an imprint being formed in the vicinity of the adsorbate molecules. In one aspect of the invention, photoinduced or electron-induced reaction of the patterned adsorbate leads to patterned reaction with the surface. The reaction can take the form of patterned attachment to the surface (patterned ""writing"" or ""doping"") or patterned removal of atoms from the surface (""etching"" which takes place in the initial reaction or through subsequent irradiation of the patterned surface). The adsorbate when irradiated with light, electrons or ions imprints a pattern on the substrate by localised reaction. The new method is exemplified by the case of a silicon substrate and chlorobenzene molecules which first adsorb in a pattern on a silicon crystal, and which when irradiated with light or electrons chlorinates the crystal in a similar pattern to that of the adsorbate. The presence of localised chemical reaction is demonstrated most directly by inducing reaction at a restricted locale and showing that this irradiaton-induced reaction occurs primarily at that same locale. The method is suitable for the writing, doping or etching of molecular-scale features.",POLANYI JOHN C,POLANYI JOHN C;;ROGERS DUNCAN,,https://lens.org/035-294-288-757-05X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,14,22,0,B82Y10/00;;B82Y40/00;;G03F7/0002;;G03F7/004;;G03F7/2043;;G03F7/2059;;H01L21/0277;;H01L21/2254;;H01L21/027;;B82Y10/00;;H01L21/0277;;H01L21/2254;;B82Y40/00;;G03F7/2043;;G03F7/0002;;G03F7/2059;;G03F7/004,G01N13/12;;G03F1/00;;G03F7/00;;G03F7/004;;G03F7/20;;H01L21/027;;H01L21/205;;H01L21/225;;H01L21/306,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A molecular-scale pattern of adsorbate molecules is used in place of the conventional macroscopic ""mask"". Molecules adsorb at surfaces in patterns, governed by the structure of the surface, the chemical nature of the adsorbate, and the adsorbate coverage at the surface. The surface is patterned and then marked or imprinted with the pattern by inducing localized chemical reaction between adsorbate molecules and the surface of the solid, resulting in an imprint being formed in the vicinity of the adsorbate molecules. In one aspect of the invention, photoinduced reaction of the patterned adsorbate leads to patterned photoreaction with the surface. The photoreaction can take the form of patterned photoattachment to the surface (patterned ""writing"" or ""doping"") or patterned photoremoval of atoms from the surface (""etching"" which takes place in the initial reaction or through subsequent photoirradiation of the photopatterned surface). The adsorbate when irradiated with light, electrons or ions imprints a pattern on the substrate by localised reaction. The new method is exemplified by the case of a silicon substrate and chlorobenzene molecules which first adsorb in a pattern on a silicon crystal, and which when irradiated chlorinate the crystal in a similar pattern to that of the adsorbate. The method is suitable for the writing, doping or etching of molecular-scale features.",POLANYI JOHN C;;ROGERS DUNCAN,POLANYI JOHN C;;ROGERS DUNCAN,ROGERS DUNCAN (1998-02-02);;GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO THE (1998-01-22);;POLANYI JOHN C (1998-02-02),https://lens.org/092-697-202-304-740,Granted Patent,yes,17,21,14,22,0,B82Y10/00;;B82Y40/00;;G03F7/0002;;G03F7/004;;G03F7/2043;;G03F7/2059;;H01L21/0277;;H01L21/2254;;H01L21/027;;B82Y10/00;;H01L21/0277;;H01L21/2254;;B82Y40/00;;G03F7/2043;;G03F7/0002;;G03F7/2059;;G03F7/004,G01N13/12;;G03F1/00;;G03F7/00;;G03F7/004;;G03F7/20;;H01L21/027;;H01L21/205;;H01L21/225,427/533;;427/553;;427/552;;427/534;;427/555;;216/94;;438/694;;438/765;;438/769;;438/767,7,5,030-866-619-920-587;;036-901-198-503-900;;150-763-356-383-626;;009-735-684-036-13X;;127-241-024-895-260,10.1088/0957-4484/7/4/009;;10.1016/s0039-6028(96)01403-3;;10.1016/0039-6028(95)00732-6;;10.1063/1.91597;;10.1021/j100016a051,"Abstract of Japan; Pub 09223455, date Aug. 26, 1997, Inventor P.

When the imprinted molecular patterns are conjugated chains containing π bonds along which electrical charge can flow the molecular patterns constitute molecular wires or the imprinted molecules constitute a molecular-scale device. The surface of the substrate can be doped by including n - or p- type dopants in the adsorbate molecules. These molecular wires are anchored to the substrate by using conjugated chains which can be chemically bound at intervals along the chains to the substrates.",POLANYI JOHN C;;ROGERS DUNCAN,POLANYI JOHN C;;ROGERS DUNCAN,,https://lens.org/097-844-901-403-333,Search Report,yes,0,0,6,22,0,B82Y10/00;;B82Y40/00;;C23C14/048;;G03F7/0002;;G03F7/004;;G03F7/2043;;G03F7/2059;;H01L21/0277;;H01L21/2254;;B82Y10/00;;G03F7/004;;G03F7/2059;;G03F7/0002;;H01L21/2254;;G03F7/2043;;H01L21/0277;;C23C14/048;;B82Y40/00,G03F1/00;;C23C14/04;;G01N13/12;;G03F7/00;;G03F7/004;;G03F7/20;;H01L21/027;;H01L21/205;;H01L21/225,,4,4,061-804-609-672-007;;150-763-356-383-626;;042-413-540-063-571;;065-974-695-994-72X,10.1016/s0169-4332(96)00482-5;;10.1016/0039-6028(95)00732-6;;10.1063/1.370946;;10.1063/1.124461,"OHSHIMA H: ""Organo-germanium adsorption on a silicon surface by excimer-light irradiation"", THIRD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ATOMICALLY CONTROLLED SURFACES AND INTERFACES.

A molecular-scale pattern of adsorbate molecules is used in place of the conventional macroscopic 'mask'. Molecules adsorb at surfaces in patterns, governed by the structure of the surface, the chemical nature of the adsorbate, and the adsorbate coverage at the surface. The surface is patterned and then marked or imprinted with the pattern by inducing localised chemical reaction between adsorbate molecules and the surface of the solid, resulting in an imprint being formed in the vicinity of the adsorbate molecules. In one aspect of the invention, photoinduced or electron-induced reaction of the patterned adsorbate leads to patterned reaction with the surface. The reaction can take the form of patterned attachment to the surface (patterned 'writing' or 'doping') or patterned removal of atoms from the surface ('etching' which takes place in the initial reaction or through subsequent irradiation of the patterned surface). The adsorbate when irradiated with light, electrons or ions imprints a pattern on the substrate by localised reaction. The new method is exemplified by the case of a silicon substrate and chlorobenzene molecules which first adsorb in a pattern on a silicon crystal, and which when irradiated with light or electrons chlorinates the crystal in a similar pattern to that of the adsorbate. The presence of localised chemical reaction is demonstrated most directly by inducing reaction at a restricted locale and showing that this irradiaton-induced reaction occurs primarily at that same locale. The method is suitable for the writing, doping or etching of molecular-scale features.",POLANYI JOHN C;;ROGERS DUNCAN,POLANYI JOHN C;;ROGERS DUNCAN,,https://lens.org/082-664-913-353-481,Patent Application,yes,2,1,14,22,0,B82Y10/00;;B82Y40/00;;G03F7/0002;;G03F7/004;;G03F7/2043;;G03F7/2059;;H01L21/0277;;H01L21/2254;;H01L21/027;;B82Y10/00;;H01L21/0277;;H01L21/2254;;B82Y40/00;;G03F7/2043;;G03F7/0002;;G03F7/2059;;G03F7/004,G01N13/12;;G03F1/00;;G03F7/00;;G03F7/004;;G03F7/20;;H01L21/027;;H01L21/205;;H01L21/225,,5,3,030-866-619-920-587;;036-901-198-503-900;;150-763-356-383-626,10.1088/0957-4484/7/4/009;;10.1016/s0039-6028(96)01403-3;;10.1016/0039-6028(95)00732-6,"BALOOCH M ET AL: ""Spontaneous and STM-induced reaction of XeF2 with Si(111)-7*7 at low coverage"", ENGINEERING FOUNDATION CONFERENCE ON ORDERED MOLECULAR AND NANOSCALE ELECTRONICS, KEAUHOU-KONA, HI, USA, JUNE 1994, vol. 7, no. 4, ISSN 0957-4484, Nanotechnology, Dec. 1996, IOP Publishing, UK, pages 356 - 359, XP002093073;;PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN vol. 097, no. 012 25 December 1997 (1997-12-25);;CHEN X H ET AL: ""Photoetching of Si(111)-(7*7) studied by STM"", SURFACE SCIENCE, 10 APRIL 1997, ELSEVIER, NETHERLANDS, vol. 376, no. 1-3, ISSN 0039-6028, pages 77 - 86, XP002093074;;CHEN X H ET AL: ""Adsorption of C6H5Cl on Si(111)7 x 7 studied by STM"", SURFACE SCIENCE, OCT 20 1995, ELSEVIER, NETHERLANDS, vol. 340, no. 3, pages 224 - 230, XP002093075;;ANONYMOUS: ""Fabrication of Gold Nanostructures by Lithography with Self-Assembled Monolayers"", IBM TECHNICAL DISCLOSURE BULLETIN, vol. 39, no. 12, December 1996 (1996-12-01), New York, US, pages 235 - 238, XP002093076",PATENTED

Insulating pipes and pipe joints; valves. SPEMBLY TECHNICAL PRODUCTS Ltd. 6 June, 1967 [9 June, 1966], No. 25820/66. Headings F2G, F2P and F2V. Thermal insulation for a pipe 1 comprises a fixed casing 2 of predetermined length spacedley surrounding the pipe and hermetically closed so as to sustain vacuum between itself and the pipe, a valve member 10 within the casing and movable axially to open or close, the end of the pipe, the casing having a section 16, 17 movable axially in relation to the adjacent portions of the casing independently of said portions and hermetically sealed thereto, externally accessible means 17A to move said section, means operably connecting said section to said valve member for operating said valve member without changing the predetermined length of said casing, and a hermetically sealed enclosure extending fluid conductively from said pipe to a further element 12 and enclosing said valve member, said enclosure permitting axial relative movement between said further element and said pipe. As shown, a fixed boss 4 of a pipe union closes the end of the casing 2 which surrounds the main run of the pipe 1, the intervening space 3 being evacuated. The boss 4 threadedly engages a sleeve 17 which has the projections 17a for manual rotation and which, upon rotation, moves a sleeve 11 over 0-rings 4B on a spigot portion 4A of the boss 4 the sleeve 11 being guided for axial movement only by pins 110, and being hermetically sealed to one end of a tube 12 and also to the corresponding end of the outer vacuum casing 16 having a connection 16B for its evacuation. The other end of the casing 16 is sealed to a boss 18 which has a portion which, with the interposition of 0-rings, engages in the socket of a coupling 19 for connecting a further pipe part and which has, extending from it, a vacuum casing pipe 20 connected at its other end to a continuation 14 of the pipe 1, the vacuum space between the pipes 14, 20 being connected to the vacuum space 15 between the casing 16 and the tube 12. A casing 6, carrying a valve plug 8 at one end is connected at its other end to the boss 4, this end of the casing 6 being in communication with the vacuum space 3 and the plug 8 slidingly receiving the fluted stem 9 of a valve 13 which has a seating washer 10A. A tappet 13 having bores 13A for the passage, e.g. of liquid nitrogen from the pipe 1 to the continuation pipe 14, is sealed to the pipe part 14 and to the tube 12. Rotation of the sleeve 17 axially moves in unison the sleeve 11, the tube 12, the boss 18, the pipes 14 and 20 and the tappet 13 which, according to the direction of rotation of the sleeve 17, closes the valve 10 or, allows the pressure of the medium in the pipe 1 to open it so that the medium can flow from the pipe 1 to the pipe portion 14. In a modification, Fig. 2, not shown, two pipe parts (21, 23) are relatively movable toward, or away, from each other when a sleeve (29), which threadedly engages a sleeve (26) and which is rotatably, but non-axially movably mounted between the spaced ends (22A, 22B) of a vacuum casing (22), is rotated by means of handles (29A) so that a valve disc (21A) with a seal (23A) in the end of one pipe part 21 is either seated or spaced from the adjacent end (23A) of the pipe part (23). The sleeve (26) which is connected by a rod (27A) and lugs (23C) to the pipe part (23) is axially slidable in the casing (22), the pipe part 21 being connected to the casing (22) by a rod (27B) and lugs (28, 21E). The ends of the pipe parts 21, 23 are enclosed by a metal bellows (24) the ends of which are sealed by rings (24A, 24B) which is preferably in the form of a detachable union, Fig. 2A, not shown. In a further modification, Fig. 3, not shown, a pipe section and valve assembly, as in Fig. 2, not shown, the sleeve (26) is replaced by one (33) which is connected to the ends of the casing parts (22) by bellows (31, 32). In a simpler arrangement, Fig. 4, not shown, a valve arrangement, generally similar to that of Fig. 2, not shown, is operated when the two parts (41, 42) of an outer casing are manipulated axially toward or away from each other.",SPEMBLY TECHNICAL PRODUCTS LTD,LESSELS JOHN;;DUNCAN COLIN ERIC,,https://lens.org/179-245-302-862-018,Granted Patent,no,0,1,2,2,0,F16L59/065;;F16L9/18;;F16L29/00;;F16L29/02,F16L9/18;;F16L29/00;;F16L29/02;;F16L59/065,F2G G5A           -;;F2G G5A2          G5A2;;F2P PC15          PC15;;F2P P1A3          -;;F2P P1A35         -;;F2V VD11F         -;;F2V VD15          -;;F2V VM1C5A        -;;F2V VM1C5B        -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Cutting ladder tapes for window blinds.-In woven ladder tapes for venetian blinds, as they come from the loom, the warps of the cross tapes cross at intervals from one main tape to the other without being intersected by weft threads. The invention consists in a machine for cutting out these unintersected warp threads. The tape is drawn through the machine by any suitable means and, by the contact of the uncut warp threads D with its teeth C, imparts rotation to the disk B, which is geared to a cam-disk F whereby the cutters are operated. The jaw J with its cutter L is first lowered between the main tapes by the action of one of the cams on the lever O; the cross warps now move up against the jaw, which is capable of a slight movement in the carriage N, parallel with the tape, under the control of a spring P<1>. The jaw K, which is likewise mounted on the carriage N and is supported by a lever Q to which is jointed a link R<2>, is now brought down to sever the threads, by the action of a cam upon a roller R at the end of the link R<2>. The cutting-device is then moved upward by the spring N' acting on the carriage N. Instead of cutters, electrically-heated wires may be used to burn through the threads.",STOREY HENRY;;CARR JOHN DUNCAN,STOREY HENRY;;CARR JOHN DUNCAN,,https://lens.org/033-555-798-355-181,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,D06H7/00,D06H7/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

A molecular-scale pattern of adsorbate molecules is used in place of the conventional macroscopic ""mask"". Molecules adsorb at surfaces in patterns, governed by the structure of the surface, the chemical nature of the adsorbate, and the adsorbate coverage at the surface. The surface is patterned and then marked or imprinted with the pattern by inducing localised chemical reaction between adsorbate molecules and the surface of the solid, resulting in an imprint being formed in the vicinity of the adsorbate molecules. In one aspect of the invention, photoinduced or electron-induced reaction of the patterned adsorbate leads to patterned reaction with the surface. The reaction can take the form of patterned attachment to the surface (patterned ""writing"" or ""doping"") or patterned removal of atoms from the surface (""etching"" which takes place in the initial reaction or through subsequent irradiation of the patterned surface). The adsorbate when irradiated with light, electrons or ions imprints a pattern on the substrate by localised reaction. The new method is exemplified by the case of a silicon substrate and chlorobenzene molecules which first adsorb in a pattern on a silicon crystal, and which when irradiated with light or electrons chlorinates the crystal in a similar pattern to that of the adsorbate. The presence of localised chemical reaction is demonstrated most directly by inducing reaction at a restricted locale and showing that this irradiaton-induced reaction occurs primarily at that same locale. The method is suitable for the writing, doping or etching of molecular-scale features.",POLANYI JOHN C,ROGERS DUNCAN;;POLANYI JOHN C,,https://lens.org/199-422-804-547-704,Patent Application,no,0,0,14,22,0,B82Y10/00;;B82Y40/00;;G03F7/0002;;G03F7/004;;G03F7/2043;;G03F7/2059;;H01L21/0277;;H01L21/2254;;H01L21/027;;B82Y10/00;;H01L21/0277;;H01L21/2254;;B82Y40/00;;G03F7/2043;;G03F7/0002;;G03F7/2059;;G03F7/004,G01N13/12;;G03F1/00;;G03F7/00;;G03F7/004;;G03F7/20;;H01L21/027;;H01L21/205;;H01L21/225,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   When voice over Internet Protocol (IP) capabilities are added to a conventional network of voice switches, an IP network is normally used to replace individual trunks between voice switches and to replace telephone lines between telephones and their serving voice switches. As a result, calls across the upgraded network often pass across a series of IP hops. This invention addresses the problem of replacing a series of IP hops by a single hop, to avoid degradation of end-to-end voice quality due to repeated packetization/depacketization sequences and associated functions such as compression/decompression.

A molecular-scale pattern of adsorbate molecules is used in place of the conventional macroscopic ""mask"". Molecules adsorb at surfaces in patterns, governed by the structure of the surface, the chemical nature of the adsorbate, and the adsorbate coverage at the surface. The surface is patterned and then marked or imprinted with the pattern by inducing localised chemical reaction between adsorbate molecules and the surface of the solid, resulting in an imprint being formed in the vicinity of the adsorbate molecules. In one aspect of the invention, photoinduced or electron-induced reaction of the patterned adsorbate leads to patterned reaction with the surface. The reaction can take the form of patterned attachment to the surface (patterned ""writing"" or ""doping"") or patterned removal of atoms from the surface (""etching"" which takes place in the initial reaction or through subsequent irradiation of the patterned surface). The adsorbate when irradiated with light, electrons or ions imprints a pattern on the substrate by localised reaction. The new method is exemplified by the case of a silicon substrate and chlorobenzene molecules which first adsorb in a pattern on a silicon crystal, and which when irradiated with light or electrons chlorinates the crystal in a similar pattern to that of the adsorbate. The method is suitable for the writing, doping or etching of molecular-scale features. The molecular scale imprinted patterns may be used to produce quantum confinements on the surfaces of nanoscale metal or semiconductor wires or films which will result in diffraction of electrons of selected energies. Variation of voltage or illumination may be used to vary the energy of the electrons.",POLANYI JOHN C,POLANYI JOHN C;;ROGERS DUNCAN,ROGERS DUNCAN (1998-02-02);;POLANYI JOHN C (1998-02-02);;THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO (1998-01-22),https://lens.org/187-009-439-177-623,Granted Patent,yes,17,82,6,22,0,B82Y10/00;;B82Y40/00;;C23C14/048;;G03F7/0002;;G03F7/004;;G03F7/2043;;G03F7/2059;;H01L21/0277;;H01L21/2254;;B82Y10/00;;G03F7/004;;G03F7/2059;;G03F7/0002;;H01L21/2254;;G03F7/2043;;H01L21/0277;;C23C14/048;;B82Y40/00,G03F1/00;;C23C14/04;;G01N13/12;;G03F7/00;;G03F7/004;;G03F7/20;;H01L21/027;;H01L21/205;;H01L21/225,427/533;;427/553;;427/552;;427/534;;427/555;;216/94;;438/694;;438/765;;438/769;;438/767,6,5,009-735-684-036-13X;;127-241-024-895-260;;030-866-619-920-587;;036-901-198-503-900;;150-763-356-383-626,10.1063/1.91597;;10.1021/j100016a051;;10.1088/0957-4484/7/4/009;;10.1016/s0039-6028(96)01403-3;;10.1016/0039-6028(95)00732-6,"""Laser-induced microscopic etching of GaAs and InP,"" D.

ENGLISH ELECTRIC CO. Ltd. Nov. 22, 1957 [Nov. 28, 1956], No. 36336/56. Class 135. A multiway fluid selector valve comprises a housing 14, a distributer member 10 having a multiplicity of ports 11 opening into the housing and having their outer ends connected by pipes to separate gas ducts (not shown), a first selector member 12 within the housing for connecting any specified number of ports to a common duct 27 and a second selector member 49 for connecting the ports of a specified group to separate individual ducts, one of which, 78, is shown in Fig. 1. The first selector comprises a rotary disc 12 carried by a shaft 15 and having "" through "" ports 13 common in number and spacing to the ports 11 in the distributer member 10. Slidably mounted in the selector 12 is a collector chamber 21 spring biased into engagement with the top face of the distributer member 10. The collector chamber 21 is arranged to cover four radially aligned ports in the distributer member 10 and is connected by a flexible pipe 23 to the lower end of an axially extending duct 24 in the shaft 15. The upper end of this duct communicates with a chamber 25 which is, in turn, connected by a flexible pipe 26 to a union 27 in the wall of the housing 14. By moving the selector 12 to the appropriate angular position any group of four radially aligned outlets may be connected to the union 27. The second selector 49 comprises a member, having four collector chambers 50 to 53 therein, which is mounted on a radial arm 48 attached to a hollow shaft 47. The member 49 is spring urged into contact with the upper face of the first selector 12. The ports 50 and 51 are connected to vertical ducts 55 and 56 respectively in the hollow shaft 47 by means of flexible pipes 57. The upper end of the duct 55 is connected by means of a flexible pipe 58 to an annular groove in a disc 60 arranged for rotation with the hollow shaft 47. The duct 56 is similarly connected to an annular groove 61 in the disc 60. The ports 52 and 53 are connected by flexible pipes 63 to annular grooves 64 and 65, respectively, in a further disc 66 secured to the hollow shaft 47. Interposed between the two discs 60 and 66 is a fixed disc 67. Four ducts 71 and 74 (72, 73 not being shown) in the disc 67 are arranged to lead one to each of the annular grooves in the discs 60 and 66 and each duct is connected by a flexible pipe to separate unions 76 to 79 in the casing 14, only union 78 being shown in Fig. 1. By moving the selector 49 to an appropriate angular position, any four radially aligned outlets may be connected to the unions 76 to 79. Both selectors are rotated in opposite directions by pneumatic actuators 33 and 80. The actuator 33 has a ratchet type engagement with the disc 31 which rotates the shaft 15 and hence the selector 12. The actuator 80 has a similar engagement with the disc 70 which is keyed to the hollow shaft 47 and thus rotates the second selector 49.",ENGLISH ELECTRIC CO LTD,RAWSON PETER JOHN;;CHISHOLM DUNCAN,,https://lens.org/139-280-940-549-213,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,F16K11/0743,F16K11/074,F2V VA6           VA6;;F2V VE56          VE5B;;F2V VE67          VE5B;;F2V VE68          VE5B,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A method for mask-free molecular or atomic patterning of surfaces of reactive solids is disclosed. Molecules adsorb at surfaces in patterns, governed by the structure of the surface, the chemical nature of the adsorbate, and the adsorbate coverage at the surface. The surface is patterned and then imprinted with the pattern by inducing localized chemical reaction between adsorbate molecules and the surface of the solid, resulting in an imprint being formed in the vicinity of the adsorbate molecules. When the imprinted molecular patterns are conjugated chains containing bonds along which electrical charge can flow the molecular patterns constitute molecular wires or the imprinted molecules constitute a molecular-scale device. The surface of the substrate can be doped by including n- or p-type dopants in the adsorbate molecules. These molecular wires are anchored to the substrate by using conjugated chains which can be chemically bound at intervals along the chains to the substrates.

A hydrostatic extrusion apparatus has a highpressure chamber 3 closed by a seal unit 2 through which the billet to be extruded passes but is free to move only when the pressure outside the seal is at least equal to the pressure in the chamber, means 21, 30 being provided to control the pressure outside the seal and second means 24 for moving the billet. The latter is a continuous rod which passes through a first seal 1 into an intermediate chamber 28 and then through the seal 2 into the high-pressure chamber 3. Both seals are formed by tapered segments of alloy steel or tungsten carbide (4), Fig. 2 (not shown), separated by layers (35) of neoprene rubber. Alternatively rubber diaphragms may be used. The seal 1 is carried by a piston 24 slidable in a housing 14 of alloy steel or cemented carbide for advancing the billet. When pressure oil is admitted through pipes 29, 30, 20 into chamber 28, seal 1 is closed against the billet and seal 2 is opened.

Compounds claimed per se are 2 - (1 - ethyl - n - hexyl) and 2-(n-propyl-n-pentyl) - 4,6 - dinitrophenyl methyl and ethyl carbonate; n-propyl, isopropyl and n-hexyl 2-(1-ethyl-n-hexyl) 4,6-dinitrophenyl carbonates. The compounds may be prepared by: (1) Reacting a compound of a general formula <FORM:1070756/C2/2> in which Q represents a hydrogen or an alkali metal atom, preferably sodium or potassium, with a haloformic acid ester of the formula (IV) Z.CO.OR where Z is chlorine, bromine or iodine, preferably chlorine, and R is as above, the reaction being effected in the presence of an acid binding agent, e.g. an alkali metal carbonate, an alkali metal bicarbonate or a tertiary amine (e.g. pyridine), where Q represents a hydrogen atom, preferably in solution in an inert organic solvent, e.g. a ketone such as acetone. The phenoxide of Formula (III) (where Q is an alkali metal) may be performed, or, preferably may be formed in situ in an inert organic solvent prior to introduction of the haloformic acid ester by reaction of the parent phenol <FORM:1070756/C2/3> with a suitable alkali metal compound, e.g. the hydroxide, carbonate or bi-carbonate. (2) The simultaneous reaction of the parent phenol (V) with a haloformic acid ester (IV) in an inert organic solvent (e.g. a ketone such as acetone) in the presence of an alkali metal carbonate or alkali metal bicarbonate, preferably an alkali metal carbonate. The haloformic acid esters (IV) may be prepared by reaction of a compound of the formula ROH with a compound of the formula COZ2 preferably in the presence of aluminium chloride as catalyst and where required in the presence of an acid binding agent. The parent dinitro-alkyl phenols (V), where R1 is as above, may be prepared by dinitration of the corresponding alkylphenols. The latter may be prepared by reacting a o-hydroxybenzoketone with an appropriate alkylmagnesium halide, to yield a tertiary carbinol, dehydration of the carbinol, followed by catalytic hydrogenation of the resultant olefine, e.g. using palladium/charcoal in ethanol. Dehydration may occur spontaneously during heating or may be effected by the use of an acid catalyst, e.g. potassium hydrogen sulphate, p-toluene sulphonic acid or sulphuric acid. In an example 2 - (1 - ethyl - n - hexyl) - 4,6 - dinitro phenyl ethyl carbonate is prepared by heating 2-(1-ethyl-n-hexyl)-4,6-dinitro phenol, potassium carbonate and acetone and adding thereto ethyl chloroformate.ALSO:Pesticidal compositions comprise as active ingredient one or more compounds of a general formula: <FORM:1070756/A5-A6/1> in which R is an alkyl group containing one to six carbon atoms and R1 represents 1-ethyl-n-hexyl or 1-n-propyl-n-pentyl together with solid or liquid carriers or diluents. Other pesticides e.g. fungicides, acaricides or insecticides may also be incorporated. The composition may be in the form of solutions or emulsions, aerosols, pastes, dusts, wettable powders, granulates and pellets and may form thermal fumigating compositions with a solid pyrotechnic component.",MURPHY CHEMICAL LTD,PIANKA MAX;;EDWARDS JOHN DUNCAN,,https://lens.org/161-358-906-946-121,Granted Patent,no,0,0,10,12,0,A01N47/06;;C07C37/055;;C07C205/23;;C07C205/23;;C07C37/055;;A01N47/06,A01N47/06;;C07C37/055;;C07C37/18;;C07C39/06;;C07C205/23,A5E EAB           EAB;;A5E E1A3B         E1C8;;A5E E1A5A1        E1C8;;A5E E1A5B2        E1C8;;A5E E1C15A7       E1C8;;A5E E1C15B2       E1C8;;A5E E1C8A         E1C8;;C2C CMK;;C2C C22Y;;C2C C220;;C2C C227;;C2C C30Y;;C2C C332;;C2C C358;;C2C C36Y;;C2C C365;;C2C C470;;C2C C471;;C2C C623;;C2C C631;;C2C C661;;C2C C662;;C2C C79Y;;C2C C791,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Molecules adsorb at surfaces in patterns, governed by the structure of the surface, the chemical nature of the adsorbate, and the adsorbate coverage at the surface. The surface is patterned and then imprinted with the pattern by inducing localized chemical reaction between adsorbate molecules and the surface of the solid, resulting in an imprint being formed in the vicinity of the adsorbate molecules. When the imprinted molecular patterns are conjugated chains containing .pi. bonds along which electrical charge can flow the molecular patterns constitute molecular wires or the imprinted molecules constitute a molecular-scale device. The surface of the substrate can be doped by including n - or p- type dopants in the adsorbate molecules. These molecular wires are anchored to the substrate by using conjugated chains which can be chemically bound at intervals along the chains to the substrates.",POLANYI JOHN C;;ROGERS DUNCAN,POLANYI JOHN C;;ROGERS DUNCAN,,https://lens.org/197-077-917-323-814,Granted Patent,no,0,0,6,22,0,B82Y10/00;;B82Y40/00;;C23C14/048;;G03F7/0002;;G03F7/004;;G03F7/2043;;G03F7/2059;;H01L21/0277;;H01L21/2254;;B82Y10/00;;G03F7/004;;G03F7/2059;;G03F7/0002;;H01L21/2254;;G03F7/2043;;H01L21/0277;;C23C14/048;;B82Y40/00,G03F1/00;;G03F7/00;;B05D1/00;;B82B3/00;;C23C14/04;;G01N13/12;;G03F7/004;;G03F7/20;;H01L21/027;;H01L21/205;;H01L21/225,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Ltd. 17 Dec., 1965 [22 Dec., 1964], No. 52061/64. Heading H2F. In a rectifying arrangement, as shown a polyphase bridge of controllable rectifiers 13R, 13Y, 13B, 14R, 14Y, 14B, auxiliary commutating rectifiers 18, 19, and capacitors 20 are provided to shut-off a conducting rectifier before natural commutation. Thus, both initiation and extinction of conduction are provided to allow for control of both output voltage and power factor. If, for example, the conducting period is arranged to be symmetrical with respect to the maximum voltage in a half wave, then a power factor of unity obtains. Varying the width of this period varies the mean output voltage. Displacing the conducting period forwards within the half cycle gives a leading power factor, and displacing it backwards a lagging power factor. As shown, diodes 15, 16 are provided to complete a current path back to the neutral point of N of transformer 10, as an alternative to a path through two main rectifiers 13, 14. A sequence of operations for the Red phase is as follows: With R negative rectifier 14R is fired and a path is completed through 14R, load 12 and diode 15 and/or either or both of rectifiers 13Y, 13B. At the end of the desired period 19R is fired discharging a capacitor 20 (previously charged with terminal 20A positive) to shut off Rectifier 19R continues to conduct until capacitor 20 is again charged with terminal 20B now positive. Subsequently, during the next half cycle when R is positive, rectifier 13R is fired and current flows through 13R, load 12 and diode 16 and/or either or both rectifiers 14Y, 14B. At the end of the desired period 18R conducts to discharge capacitor 20 through rectifier 13R to shut it off. A similar sequence applies to the yellow and blue phases.",ENGLISH ELECTRIC CO LTD,MCCOLL JOHN DUNCAN;;POTTER NORMAN LEONARD,,https://lens.org/150-375-054-952-737,Granted Patent,no,0,3,3,3,0,H02M7/1623;;H02M1/06;;H02M1/4233;;Y02B70/10;;H02M7/1623;;H02M1/06;;H02M1/4233;;Y02B70/10,H02M7/162,H2F FSQ           FSQ;;H2F FSQ           F9B2;;H2F F14           -;;H2F F9B2          -;;H2F F9F1          -;;H2F F9F5          -;;H2F F9K4          -;;H2F F9N3X         -;;H2F F9P1          -;;H2F F9R26B        -;;H2F F9R8B         -;;H2F F9T1          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A high power linear amplifier is disclosed for communications such as CDMA communication systems. Linear amplifiers as used in communication systems exhibit a linear characteristic where the amplifiers output power increases relative to an input power. After a certain input level, known as a gain saturation point, the amplifier then exhibits non-linear characteristics; the output power increases relatively little with respect to power input. This non-linear region is also known as the saturation region or the gain compression region. In accordance with the invention, there is provided a power amplifier comprising a power amplifier, a feedback circuit and a control element; wherein the feedback circuit receives a sample of the input signal delayed in time and employs phase and amplitude components of both the input signal delayed in time and a feedback signal derived from the output of the power amplifier to drive a control element, which control element determines the signal input to the amplifier whereby the power amplifier can produce an improved linear output.",NORTEL NETWORKS CORP,WESSEL DAVID NEAL;;MCNICOL JOHN DUNCAN,,https://lens.org/190-128-097-757-352,Patent Application,no,0,0,6,6,0,H03F1/3241;;H03F1/3241,H03F1/32,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The key advantage lies in the significant reduction in number of second stage beam-forming control points (at which independent amplitude and phase is applied) when compared with a conventional phased array (where amplitude and phase control is applied for each element of the array). The sub-array stage beam-forming may be implemented in analogue technology. The main beam-former may be implemented in digital technology, where the key processing functions of A/D or D/A conversion, frequency (de)multiplexing and digital beam-forming all scale with the number of control points.",ASTRIUM LTD;;CRAIG ANTONY DUNCAN;;STIRLAND SIMON JOHN,CRAIG ANTONY DUNCAN;;STIRLAND SIMON JOHN,,https://lens.org/050-448-099-596-536,Patent Application,yes,6,11,14,15,0,H01Q1/288;;H01Q3/26;;H01Q21/0006;;H01Q21/061;;H01Q21/22;;H01Q25/00;;H04B7/18515;;H01Q1/288;;H01Q21/22;;H01Q25/00;;H01Q21/061;;H01Q21/0006;;H01Q3/26;;H04B7/18515,H01Q1/28;;H01Q3/26;;H01Q21/00;;H01Q21/06;;H01Q21/22;;H01Q25/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING
