Preferably the weight per unit area of the sheet is substantially uniform, and the zones are located at the bases of depressions having sloping walls from the tops to the bottoms of which the specific gravity of the sheet increases. The wood particles may be wood chips or sawdust and the adhesive may be of urea-formaldehyde, phenol-formaldehyde, or an epoxy resin. The zones are distributed in an array of any desired geometrical form, preferably in a rectangle, e.g. a square, and the portions of sheet between the zones are preferably of uniform width. In one example a layer of a mixture of wood chips and urea formaldehyde resin glue containing ammonium chloride or an acidic hardening agent is spread on a flat heated platen, and the lower part of the layer confined within a metal frame. Above the layer is then placed a metal plate having the pattern required to produce a surface having frusto pyramidal depressions of square tops and bottoms, and which are centred at the intersections of two mutually perpendicular sets of parallel equally spaced lines. The whole is then pressed at 80 to 100 p.s.i. for 6 minutes at 130 DEG C. Alternatively the heated platen may be provided with a pattern so that the product has depressions on both of its faces in coincident or different positions.

[Also in Division G1] A tunnel diode D is connected in a forwardly conducting sense in the emitter or collector circuit of a transistor Q and so biased that when a square wave is applied from a source W to the base, the tunnel diode forward bias is shifted between a positive and a negative resistance operating point thereof, so that an input A.C. signal I applied to the transistor base is phase reversed or not, in the collector circuit output, and without change of amplitude, according to the square wave polarity. If w 1 , w 2 are the angular frequencies of the A.C. and square wave respectively, and Y the A.C. input amplitude, the output is The A.C. input I may include a low pass filter ganged with the switching wave generator W, to exclude from the A.C. input any frequencies greater than that of the generator, and thus avoid low frequency beats between them and the w 2 harmonics. If now, the collector circuit includes a very low pass filter (which produces an output only when w 1 , w 2 . are substantially equal), then the product of Y.sin w 1 t with the w 2 harmonics is eliminated from the output, and only the product Y.sin w 1 t.sin w 2 t derived. This signal may be passed to an integrator, the output of which may be used to plot the frequency spectrum of the input I over a range of frequencies determined by varying the switching frequency w 2 .",SECR AVIATION,GRANT BRIAN ERIC;;KIMBER GERALD ADRIAN,,https://lens.org/145-719-290-603-77X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G06G7/163;;H03F3/12,G06G7/163;;H03F3/12,G1U UBF           UBF;;G1U U10B1         DA;;G1U U10H2         DA;;G1U U10H3         DA;;H3R R9M2          -;;H3T TQX           TQX;;H3T TQXX          TQXX;;H3T T1A1          -;;H3T T2T2N1        -;;H3T T2T3J         -;;H3T T3X           -;;H3T T4A2          -;;H3T T4E2N         -;;H3W WQS           WQS,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

An extrusion plant for producing tubes and the like comprises an extrusion press EP, a billet piercing press PP, a group of primary heating units H1-H4 and a group of secondary heating units H5-H8, the piercing press and the heating units being arranged on opposite sides of a plane M-M perpendicular to the extrusion axis A-A. Billets which may be solid or have small bores, enter at R1 and are fed by pushers P1-P6 into horizontal induction heaters H1-H4 and then on to carriage SC4 which moves them through a descaling unit DS1 having steam or water jets. The billets then pass along roller tables RT2, R2 where they are coated with pulverised lubricant and into receptacle RE1 from which they are transferred by mechanism TG1 into the vertical hydraulic piercing press PP which has two billet holders 10 on a rotary table 11. The transfer mechanism TG1 is preferably of the kind described in Specification 1,094,722 and similar mechanism TG2 moves the pierced billets to a receptacle RE2 from which they are transferred along roller table RT3 to secondary heaters H5-H8 of the vertical induction type. After passing through a further descaling unit DS2, the billets are coated internally with lubricant by units LB1, LB2 and then roll down table R3 where they are coated externally with lubricant, and into the extrusion press E.P. This consists of rotary carrier 4 for containers 3 into which the billets are pushed by member 5. Dies are mounted on a rotary die carrier 6. After extrusion by a press stem 1 and independently movable mandrel 2, the extruded tubes pass along run out table 7 and into a cooling bed CB.

A billet transfer apparatus comprises billet holding means 20 rotatable about an axis Y-Y and also movable from a billet receiving station to a billet discharge station. In the extrusion of tubes, metal billets B 2 , which may be solid or have small drilled bores, are placed in the container 102 of a piercing press, compacted by an outer ram 10 and pierced by an inner stem 8. A retractable stem 14 permits disposal of the waste metal. Containers 2, 102 are mounted on a rotary turret 4 which moves the pierced billets B 1 to an ejection station where they are discharged by ejection means 16 into the holding means 20. This comprises an open trough into which the billets are clamped by member 22 operated by a fluid motor 24 and which is mounted on a shaft 28 rotatable in a horizontal cantilever arm 26. The latter is rotatable about a vertical axis X-X in either direction by rotary hydraulic motors 46, 48 for transferring the billet to a horizontal roller conveyer 18 on to which it is pushed by fluid operated means 64. During its transfer the billet is turned through 90 in either direction about axis Y-Y by a fluid motor 36. Pre-drilled billets are preferably turned in the opposite direction to the initially solid billets. The conveyer 18 moves the billets to the extrusion press.

    Available bandwidth utilization during transfer of large files over a TCP/IP network, is improved by segmenting the file and concurrently transmitting portions in an optimal number of logical distinct data streams which may all utilize a single physical medium and communications path. An initial number of data streams, is used to begin transmission of segments, each on a different data stream. During the first seconds of the transfer, individual and aggregate transmission bandwidths are determined, together with a backbone limit computed from the sliding window and round trip times. If the individual transmission bandwidths are approximately equal to the backbone limit, additional data stream(s) and segment(s) are started. Individual and aggregate transmission bandwidths are again determined, and the process is repeated until no substantial increase in aggregate bandwidth is achieved by adding an additional data stream. Aggregate transmission bandwidths are checked upon completion of each segment to determine if a data stream should be terminated.

A temperature is applied to the cerebrospinal fluid in the tube. The power output of the applied temperature is modulated by a sinusoidal pattern having a central frequency ranging from ImHz to 1Hz. The temperature can be applied by thermal elements and could involve heating of the cerebrospinal fluid or cooling of the cerebrospinal fluid. The temperature-related changes of the cerebrospinal fluid in the hydrocephalus shunt induced by the temperature application are then measured by sensors. From these measured temperature changes, the flow rate is inferred for the cerebrospinal fluid in the hydrocephalus shunt. The sinusoidal modulation is robust to variation of environment temperature variation, because only signals at the specific frequency of temperature modulation are utilized to infer the flow rate.",UNIV LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR,CHEN ZHIJIE;;GUPTA VIVEK;;GARY ASHLYN;;FAN RICHARD;;GRANT GERALD,,https://lens.org/054-575-046-750-453,Patent Application,yes,4,0,1,1,0,G01K13/026;;G01K1/14;;G01K1/20;;G01K17/08;;G01F1/6842;;G01F1/696;;A61B5/6865;;A61B5/028,A61B5/03;;G01F1/00;;G01F1/66;;G01L9/00;;G01L27/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

    A system and method for generating service quality statistics for a communications network is disclosed. Network monitors capture messages in a communications network, such as an SS7 network, and correlate related messages into records. The records are filtered using a call detail record profile to create call detail records which are provided to an statistics server. The statistics server generates certain statistics for the message records and stores the statistics to a database. A report application recalls the statistics from the database and presents statistics in a reporting format configured by the user. The reports indicate the statistical performance of network providers for selected called or calling telephone numbers or for selected services.

The mass memory includes a plurality of volumes of write-once media such as optical discs. The method involves grouping the volumes into volume sets, which each contain at least one file set, and dynamically increasing the size of the file sets and volume sets as needed during file storage. Update areas are set aside for each file set for modifications to the original data originally written into that file set. Allocation of storage to allow time-efficient access of files is accomplished by examining storage media characteristics, limits on file set size, and sizes of the data to be written into the file sets. Timers are set to indicate when volumes contain obsolete data and can be removed, when no additional data should be written onto volumes which are not obsolete, and when a volume should be flipped over so the other surface can be filled.",FILETEK INC,ASHCRAFT WILLIAM J;;WOODSIDE III GRANT E;;CURRINGTON GERALD W;;ROBB KENNETH A,FILETEK INC. 6100 EXECUTIVE BOULEVARD ROCKVILLE MD 20852 A CORP.

The method for reduction of acrylamide formation by way of decrease of asparagine content in a potato product envisages selective leaching of asparagine and starch from an untreated potato product with potato extract containing an insignificant quantity of asparagines. Concentrations of water-soluble compounds in the said potato extract (apart from asparagine and starch) are equilibrium or nearly equilibrium to corresponding concentrations of water-soluble compounds in the untreated potato product. The said potato extract is heated to a temperature of approximately 38C - 66C. This results in production of a treated potato product the second concentration of asparagine therein is less than the first one. One additionally produces an after-washing extract containing asparagine and starch. Then the treated potato product undergoes thermal treatment at a temperature in excess of approximately 120C. After that the said starch is removed from the said after-wash extract with the help of a starch removal installation. ^ EFFECT: invention enables manufacture of potato products with significantly reduced level of asparagine content. ^ 16 cl, 17 dwg, 3 tbl",FRITO LEJ SEV AMERIKA INK,BUDRO EHRIK;;DESAI PRAVIN MAGANLAL;;EHLDER VINSENT ALLEN;;FULCHER DZHON GREGORI;;DZHOZEF PONNATTU KURIAN;;LI VU;;RAO V N MOKHAN;;TOPOR MAJKL GRANT;;VOGEL GERALD DZHEJMS,,https://lens.org/014-093-365-736-12X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,26,26,0,A23L5/21;;A23L19/18;;A23L19/12;;A23L5/10;;A23L19/18;;A23L5/21,A23L5/10;;A23L5/20;;A23L19/12,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
