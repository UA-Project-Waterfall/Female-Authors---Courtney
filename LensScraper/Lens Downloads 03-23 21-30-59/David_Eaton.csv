The method comprises illuminating the thread with light at a frequency which causes the oil to fluoresce and detecting light emitted from the moving thread by fluorescence. Light reflected from the thread may also be detected. For this purpose the device has a light source (50) and a light sensor (54). The light sensor 54 may be responsive to light at the frequencies of fluorescence of the oil and unresponsive to light at the frequencies emitted by the source (50). The output of the light sensor (54) can be processed and calibrated to provide information about the oil borne by the thread. The invention can be applied in relation to manufacture of threads, especially in relation to spinning of synthetic threads, making possible real time monitoring of the oil carried, without physical contact with the thread.",SAURER FIBREVISION LTD,EATON DAVID,,https://lens.org/178-453-871-728-441,Patent Application,yes,3,0,3,3,0,D01D5/096;;D01H13/306;;D01H13/32;;G01N21/64;;G01N21/643;;G01N21/8915;;G01N33/28;;G01N33/365;;G01N33/365;;G01N2021/8416;;G01N2021/8444,G01N21/64;;D01D5/096;;D01H13/32;;G01N33/36,,1,0,,,"S.KOKENES ET AL.: ""Measurement of finish uniformity on textile yarns"", CHEMICAL FIBERS INTERNATIONAL, vol. 48, September 1998 (1998-09-01), pages 325 - 327, XP009190906",PENDING

   A method of and apparatus for monitoring the processing of a multifilament yarn to indicate a number of protrusions in the yarn is provided. In this method, a multifilament yarn is passed through a light beam directed from a light emitting device to a light receiving device, and the amount of light received by the light receiving device is measured at predetermined time intervals. From the measured amounts of light over a predetermined time period a measuring and computing device produces a frequency distribution, and a threshold level representative of an ideal yarn is calculated from the frequency distribution. The number of measurements that fall outside that threshold level is recorded and is indicative of the number of filament breaks and loops in the yarn.

    A method of and apparatus for monitoring the processing of a multifilament yarn to indicate a number of protrusions in the yarn is provided. In this method, a multifilament yarn is passed through a light beam directed from a light emitting device to a light receiving device, and the amount of light received by the light receiving device is measured at predetermined time intervals. From the measured amounts of light over a predetermined time period a measuring and computing device produces a frequency distribution, and a threshold level representative of an ideal yarn is calculated from the frequency distribution. The number of measurements that fall outside that threshold level is recorded and is indicative of the number of filament breaks and loops in the yarn.

The same shared sense amplifier is also positioned between and coupled to third and fourth bit lines via third and fourth isolation transistors. When the state of an accessed memory cell is to be sensed, its memory cell capacitor is coupled to a selected bit line and a dummy cell capacitor is coupled to the bit line adjacent the selected bit line. A decoding circuit selectively activates the shared sense amplifier to sense a difference in voltage between the selected bit line and its adjacent bit line so as to determine the logic state associated with the accessed memory cell. Then, the sense amplifier latches into this logic state for reading by the input/output buss lines.

The invention further relates to a method for sealing an underground link box (1) against water ingress. Underground link boxes (1) of the art have the disadvantage that relative movement (flexure) of the end portions (7) with respect to the center portion (6) may result in cracks (63) in the underground link box (1) through which water may enter, resulting in failure of the underground link box (1). The inventive underground link box (1) solves this problem by further comprising a sealing member (71) of a sealing agent (73), which remains flexible after being hardened. Accordingly, in the inventive method, a sealing agent (73) is poured into the underground link box (1) for forming a sealing member (71), whereby the sealing agent (73) remains flexible after being hardened.

The catalyst which may be used at between 0À01 and 5% based on the wt. of polyhydroxy compound may be perhydrodipyrido - [1,2 - a : 2<SP>1</SP>,1<SP>1</SP> - c] - pyrazine. Foams may be obtained by including water or a lowboiling ( < 75‹ C.) organic liquid in the reaction mixture. The polyhydroxy compound may be one containing predominantly secondary hydroxyl groups. The tertiary amine of the invention may be used in conjunction with other catalysts, e.g. stannous octoate, dibutyl tin dilaurate or lead octoate. The catalyst may be used in the form of a quaternary ammonium salt by reacting with one molar proportion of a compound RX where R is an alkyl, cycloalkyl or aralkyl radical and X is an atom or group capable of ionizing to form the anion of a quaternary ammonium salt.",ICI LTD,ALLPORT DENNIS CHARLTON;;EATON DAVID CRAWFORD,,https://lens.org/106-229-233-996-355,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,C08G18/2063,C08G18/20,C3R R32B2A2       R32K;;C3R R32D1         -;;C3R R32D10        R32K;;C3R R32D11C       R32K;;C3R R32D12        R32K;;C3R R32D16B       R32K;;C3R R32D16C       R32K;;C3R R32D2         R32K;;C3R R32D4         -;;C3R R32D6A        R32K;;C3R R32D6C        -;;C3R R32D6D        -;;C3R R32E1         R32K;;C3R R32G1Y        R32K;;C3R R32G2Y        R32K;;C3R R32H1         R32K;;C3R R32H10        R32K;;C3R R32H4         -;;C3R R32H5BY       R32K;;C3R R32H5B2       R32K;;C3R R32H5D        -;;C3R R32H6A        R32K;;C3R R32H6Y        R32K;;C3R R32H8         R32K;;C3R R32J1Y        -;;C3R R32J2F        R32K;;C3R R32J2Y        -;;C3R R32J3Y        -;;C3R R32J9H        -;;C3R R32KD         R32K;;C3R R32P5AY       R32K;;C3R R32P5A2       R32K,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A communication device such as pager (  100  ) includes a real-time clock circuit (  118  ). The real-time clock circuit keeps track of both the pager's home time zone information (  402  ) and the pager's current time zone information (  404  ). While the pager user is operating within his home area, the pager's home time zone information (  402  ) and the current or local time zone information (  404  ) will be the same. If the user however travels away from his home system's time zone, the real-time clock circuit adjusts the current time zone information (  404  ) to reflect the time zone the user is currently operating in. The user can set alarms which reference either the home time zone information (  402  ) or the current time zone information (  404  ). This allows for more user flexibility on how the alarm conditions are to operate.

Aminated polyethers; polyurethanes. IMPERIAL CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES Ltd. 27 July, 1966 [11 Aug., 1965], No. 34366/65. Headings C3C and C3R. [Also in Division C2] Polyethers containing hydroxyl and primary amino groups are obtained by reacting a polyether containing both primary and secondary hydroxyl groups, at least 15% of the hydroxyl groups being primary, with ammonia in the presence of hydrogen and a hydrogenation/dehydrogenation catalyst. Starting materials may be obtained by the polymerization of alkylene oxides containing at least 3 carbons in the presence of active hydrogen containing compounds, e.g. oxypropylated trimethylolpropane and ethylene oxide tipped oxypropylated glycerol, and also by the cationic polymerization of alkylene oxides containing at least 3 carbons using catalysts such as boron trifluoride. Random and block copolyethers containing primary hydroxyl groups and prepared from alkylene oxides containing at least 3 carbons and cyclic ethers such as ethylene oxide, oxacyclobutane and tetrahydrofuran are also suitable starting materials. Catalysts include Raney nickel, Raney cobalt, nickel on Kieselguhr and cobalt on Kieselguhr and are usually used in amounts of from 1 to 20% based on the hydroxyl group-containing polyether. Temperatures of from 150‹ to 300‹ C. and pressures of up to 200 atmospheres are suitably employed.

The system includes a scale system having a platform connected to a load cell, which provides an output signal to an analog-to-digital converter. The resulting digital output signal is processed by a low pass filter and analyzed by a microprocessor to determine weights of items on the platform. The microprocessor also determines postage amounts as functions of the weights and outputs these postage amounts to a postage meter. The system also includes an accelerometer and a limit detector for generating a no go signal if external vibrations exceed a predetermined limit. The microprocessor accepts a weight as valid if the external vibrations do not exceed the limit at any time while the weight is being determined and otherwise initiates an alternative weight determining method.

To increase speed of the clock network, the first clock bus is segmented (in one embodiment, collinearly extending segments can be selectively coupled together via selectively programmable antifuses) so that only a short piece of the first clock bus is used to couple either the pad or the logic cell to the clock network in high speed applications.",QUICKLOGIC CORP,EATON DAVID D;;LULLA MUKESH T;;LIU KER-CHING,QUICKLOGIC CORPORATION (1997-01-03),https://lens.org/139-533-683-950-550,Granted Patent,yes,44,18,1,15,0,H03K17/223;;H03K17/223;;H03K19/177;;H03K19/177,H02H9/00;;H03K17/22;;H03K19/177,326/39;;326/93;;326/41;;327/297,9,1,005-511-843-245-150,10.1007/978-1-4615-2742-8_1,"Actel FPGA Data Book and Design Guide, pp. ix xv, 1 5 through 1 34, 1 51 through 1 101, 1 153 through 1 222, 3 1 through 4 56 (1995).;;Xilinx, The Programmable Gate Array Design Book , First Edition, pp. 1 9 through 2 73 (1986).;;S.

   An apparatus and method provide for singulating thin and substantially porous material layers arranged in a stack. A pick head is positioned above the stack of material layers. An adhesive tape is stabilized against the pick head through use of a vacuum between the adhesive tape and the pick head. Contact is effected between the stabilized adhesive tape and the top material layer. The pick head is moved to move the top material layer from the stack to a predetermined location. While at the predetermined location, the adhesive tape is detached from the top material layer. The singulation apparatus and method are particularly well suited for destacking individual porous fluid transport layers (FTLs) from a magazine of FTLs during automated fuel cell assembly.

IMPERIAL CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES Ltd. 14 June, 1967 [22 June, 1966], No. 27869/66. Headings C3C and C3R. Polyurethanes are stabilized against the adverse effects of light, oxygen and oxides of nitrogen by incorporating, either during or after the formation of the polyurethane, a nickel di(hydrocarbyl) dithiophosphate which is a nickel salt of an acid of the formula wherein R and R<SP>1</SP> are the same or different hydrocarbon or substituted hydrocarbon radicals, or a combination of nickel and zinc compounds selected from di(hydrocarbyl) dithiophosphates and #-keto-enolates of the formula wherein M is nickel or zinc and X, Y and Z independently represent hydrogen atoms or alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, aryl, alkoxy or carbalkoxy groups, or X and Y together may form the residue of an aromatic system, at least one of the compounds being a di(hydrocarbyl) dithiophosphate. The polyurethanes may be foamed and are prepared from conventional polyols e.g. polyethers and polyesters and polyisocyanates. Suitable amounts of the stabilizing agent(s) are 0.01 to 5% by weight based on the weight of the polyurethane. Preferred di(hydrocarbyl) dithiophosphates are nickel or zinc dinonyldithiophosphate, diisopropyldithiophosphate, diphenyldithiophosphate or salts of the di- (hydrocarbyl) dithiophosphoric acids that are the reaction products of phosphorus pentasulphide with polyalkylene ethers of aliphatic monohydric alcohols or polyalkylene polyols. Suitable #-keto-enolates are the nickel and zinc complexes of acetyl acetone, benzoyl acetone, dibenzoylmethane, ethyl acetoacetate, diethylmalonate, salicylaldehyde, 2 - hydroxybenzophenone and 2 - hydroxy - 4 - alkoxybenzophenones. Other stabilizing agents such as phosphites, hydrophosphites, thiophosphites, thioether and phenols may also be used.",ICI LTD,BRIGGS PETER JAMES;;BROOKS JOHN LANGSHAW;;EATON DAVID CRAWFORD,,https://lens.org/001-134-288-505-358,Granted Patent,no,0,0,8,11,0,C08J9/0014;;C08J9/0014;;C08J2375/04;;C08J2375/04;;C08K5/13;;C08K5/13;;C08K5/51;;C08K5/51;;C08K5/5398;;C08K5/5398,C08J9/00;;C08K5/5398,C3R R32A          -;;C3R R32B2A2       R32K;;C3R R32B2X        R32K;;C3R R32C10        -;;C3R R32C11        -;;C3R R32C12        R32K;;C3R R32C13M       R32K;;C3R R32C13P       R32K;;C3R R32C13S       R32K;;C3R R32C23        -;;C3R R32C25        R32K;;C3R R32C27        -;;C3R R32C28A       R32K;;C3R R32C28X       R32K;;C3R R32C6X        R32K;;C3R R32D1         R32K;;C3R R32D10        R32K;;C3R R32D11A       R32K;;C3R R32D11C       R32K;;C3R R32D12        R32K;;C3R R32D16C       R32K;;C3R R32D2         R32K;;C3R R32D4         -;;C3R R32D6A        R32K;;C3R R32D6C        -;;C3R R32D6D        -;;C3R R32D6K        R32K;;C3R R32D9B1       R32K;;C3R R32E1         R32K;;C3R R32E11        R32K;;C3R R32E2A        R32K;;C3R R32E2Y        R32K;;C3R R32E8         -;;C3R R32E9         R32K;;C3R R32FX         R32K;;C3R R32F1         -;;C3R R32F3         R32K;;C3R R32F5         R32K;;C3R R32G1Y        R32K;;C3R R32G2Y        R32K;;C3R R32G3D        R32K;;C3R R32H1         R32K;;C3R R32H10        R32K;;C3R R32H2         -;;C3R R32H3         -;;C3R R32H4         -;;C3R R32H5BY       R32K;;C3R R32H5B2       R32K;;C3R R32H6A        R32K;;C3R R32H6Y        R32K;;C3R R32H8         R32K;;C3R R32H9A        R32K;;C3R R32H9C        R32K;;C3R R32J1Y        -;;C3R R32J2C        R32K;;C3R R32J2F        R32K;;C3R R32J2Y        R32K;;C3R R32J3Y        -;;C3R R32J9E        R32K;;C3R R32J9H        -;;C3R R32KE         R32K;;C3R R32L1B        R32K;;C3R R32L6D        R32K,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Further, compressibility can be improved, rebound in the overall dental composite during a bonding procedure can be decreased, and the amount of extractable components can be reduced.SELECTED DRAWING: Figure 1C",3M INNOVATIVE PROPERTIES CO,DAVID K CINADER JR;;BILL H DODGE;;BRADLEY W EATON,,https://lens.org/064-039-138-379-456,Patent Application,no,3,0,5,5,0,A61C7/16;;A61C7/146;;A61C5/50;;A61C5/70;;A61K6/15;;A61K6/86;;A61K6/891;;A61K6/30;;A61K6/887;;A61C7/16;;A61C7/146;;A61C5/70;;A61C5/50;;A61K6/86;;A61K6/15;;A61K6/30;;A61K6/887;;A61K6/891;;A61C7/282;;A61C13/26,A61K6/00;;A61C13/00;;A61K6/891,,0,0,,,,PENDING

    A mechanical linkage, including a worm gear and a worm gear support bracket, for joining a drive motor to a helical gear; it is particularly adapted for controlling a tape drive head. The worm gear head is threadably engaged with the helical gear. The shaft of the worm gear is engaged with the motor and is sufficiently flexible to operably correct misalignments between the worm gear shaft and the motor shaft. The support bracket includes a flat leaf spring which provides lateral spring force against the worm gear shaft to maintain a driving engagement between the worm gear and the helical gear, while the leaf spring is stiff in the in-plane directions of movement. The support bracket also includes a bushing, such as a C-shaped bushing or a cylindrical bushing, which provides support for the worm gear shaft against the helical gear.

   A mechanical linkage, including a worm gear and a worm gear support bracket, for joining a drive motor to a helical gear; it is particularly adapted for controlling a tape drive head. The worm gear head is threadably engaged with the helical gear. The shaft of the worm gear is engaged with the motor and is sufficiently flexible to operably correct misalignments between the worm gear shaft and the motor shaft. The support bracket includes a flat leaf spring which provides lateral spring force against the worm gear shaft to maintain a driving engagement between the worm gear and the helical gear, while the leaf spring is stiff in the in-plane directions of movement. The support bracket also includes a bushing, such as a C-shaped bushing or a cylindrical bushing, which provides support for the worm gear shaft against the helical gear.

    A field programmable gate array includes a programmable interconnect structure and plurality of logic cells. The logic cells each include a number of combinatorial logic circuits, which have direct interconnections with the programmable interconnect structure, and a plurality of sequential logic element, such as D type flip-flops that acts as registers. The combinatorial logic circuits may be directly connected to the programmable interconnect structure as well as connected to the input terminals of the sequential logic elements. Consequently, the logic cells include both combinatorial and registered connections with the programmable interconnect structure. Moreover, one of the sequential elements may selectively receive a dedicated input from the programmable interconnect structure. The output leads of the logic cell is connected to the programmable interconnect structure through a driver that includes a protection transistor. The gate of the protection transistor is coupled to a primary charge pump that is shared with multiple drivers as well as a secondary charge pump associated with the driver.

The model is a function of the concentration of materials in the known fluid samples as a function of absorption of wideband infrared energy. The wideband infrared energy is coupled to the analyte containing sample so there is differential absorption of the infrared energy as a function of the wavelength of the wideband infrared energy incident on the analyte containing sample. The differential absorption causes intensity variations of the infrared energy incident on the analyte containing sample as a function of sample wavelength of the energy, and concentration of the unknown analyte is determined from the thus-derived intensity variations of the infrared energy as a function of wavelength from the model absorption versus wavelength function.

The model is a function of the concentration of materials in the known fluid samples as a function of absorption of wideband infrared energy. The wideband infrared energy is coupled to the analyte containing sample so there is differential absorption of the infrared energy as a function of the wavelength of the wideband infrared energy incident on the analyte containing sample. The differential absorption causes intensity variations of the infrared energy incident on the analyte containing sample as a function of sample wavelength of the energy, and concentration of the unknown analyte is determined from the thus-derived intensity variations of the infrared energy as a function of wavelength from the model absorption versus wavelength function.",HAALAND DAVID MICHAEL;;ROBINSON MARK RIES;;UNIV OF NEW MEXICO;;WARD KENNETH JOHN,ROBINSON MARK RIES;;WARD KENNETH JOHN;;ROBERT PHILIP EATON M D;;HAALAND DAVID MICHAEL,,https://lens.org/067-262-267-000-351,Patent Application,no,0,0,16,16,0,A61B5/14532;;A61B5/1455;;A61B5/1459;;A61B5/6876;;A61B5/6884;;G01N21/359;;G01N21/552;;G01N2201/129;;G01N21/552;;A61B5/6884;;G01N21/359;;A61B5/14532;;G01N2201/129;;A61B5/1459;;A61B5/1455;;A61B5/6876,G01N33/49;;A61B5/00;;A61B5/145;;A61B5/1455;;A61B5/1459;;G01N21/35;;G01N21/55;;G01N33/487,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Upper fasteners rigidly secured to vehicle support structure extend through longitudinally extending upper slots in the mounting bracket. Lower fasteners rigidly secured to the vehicle support structure extend through longitudinally extending lower slots in the mounting bracket. The connection of the fasteners in the slots of the mounting bracket releases in response to longitudinal collapse of the steering column in a frontal impact. The vehicle support structure overlies the mounting bracket to resist upward displacement of the mounting bracket when the steering column collapses. Pull loop assemblies are associated with the lower fasteners. Each pull loop assembly includes a generally U-shaped strap of flexible, bendable material having a first leg connected to one of the lower fasteners. Each strap has a second leg which is unattached.

The method 1400 includes a first step 1410 of receiving on a device of a network infrastructure one or more packets containing one or more frames, wherein the one or more frames are associated with a computer application. Next, in step 1420, the content of the frames is examined for one or more signatures associated with the computer application and for other information obtained from one or more mechanisms. In step 1430, the examined content is compared with computer application information of the one or more signatures and the other information. In step 1440, a most likely match is established for the computer application associated with the one or more frames derived from the comparison. In step 1450, the match information is outputted representing an indication of a likely computer application associated with the examined frames based on the comparison. The information about the likely match may include a level of confidence in the indication. Optionally under the method 1400, the information from the mechanisms may be weighted. The method 1400 further includes the optional steps of: a) scoring the comparison to assess the likely accuracy of the correlation between the computer application identified by the one or more signatures comparison and the other information; and b) generating a single output with an identification of the likely computer application associated with the received one or more frames. The method 1400 may also include the step of adding one or more other mechanisms, including custom mechanisms, as part of the comparison. The other mechanisms may be provided through an application programming interface. The step 1450 of outputting the information may be carried out by transmitting the identification of the likely computer application to a network control manager. Reliable application fingerprinting is best accomplished through the combination of both signature and heuristic processing. A scoring system leverages these application identification mechanism. The scoring system may be derived from a network training period for any specific application fingerprinting deployment, and through the information gained in the training period, a set of scores is assigned to all signatures and heuristic methods.
