The ion energy may be obtained from the ratio of the intensity of the fundamental to the second harmonic frequencies of the periodic trapping oscillation making it possible to measure both the m/z and charge of each ion. Because ions with the exact same m/z but different energies appear at different frequencies, the probability of ion-ion interference is significantly reduced.

The new emitter converts the first intermediate data structure to the desired output file. The first intermediate data structure and a set of entry classes which correspond to elements in the interface definition file are input to an object graph builder. The object graph builder translates the first intermediate data structure to a second intermediate data structure called the object graph by creating instances from the set of entry classes. Typically, a new instance of a user-defined subclass of the emitter class is created by subclassing, the new emitter object instance translates the second intermediate data structure to the desired output file. Additionally, the emitter can be changed by creating a new subclass of at least one of the entry classes by subclassing so that the second intermediate data structure created by the object graph builder is altered. Template objects allow the developer to specify a new format of a section of the desired output file than would be normally output by the emitter.

The edge tear and incomplete cut-off are worse for films containing low melting polymers, such as metallocene-catalyzed ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymers. These problems can be solved using a clamp - cut-seal process, as opposed to a clamp-seal-cut process. By cutting before sealing, the film is still cool, and the strain on the fil m due to the cutting does not pull on the seal area enough to cause edge tearing (i.e., tearing at the seal). The higher resistance to elongation of the cool, clamped film also serves to reduce or prevent incomplete bag tail cutoff.
