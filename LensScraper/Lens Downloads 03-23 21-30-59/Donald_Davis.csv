A radio beacon, e.g. for air-sea rescue work, is provided with a flexible aerial attached to an inflatable float which is automatically inflated upon the initial operation of the apparatus to eject and extend the aerial automatically. The apparatus is carried in a textile vest 10, Fig. 1, a parachute being fitted over the vest, and is provided with a pocket 9 carrying a battery 11, a pocket 13 housing a radio transmitter 18 which is switched on when the parachute opens by a cord 15a attached to a hook 14 on the parachute riser, and a pocket 16 carrying the collapsed aerial and float also controlled by a cord. The flaps of the pocket 16 are held closed by a cord which passes through a conventional reefing-cutter including a delay mechanism which is actuated by a cord attached to a parachute riser. An inflator switch for triggering the inflator of the float is normally held open by a cord also passing through the reefing cutter. When the parachute is opened both cords are cut, the pocket 16 is opened and the switch is actuated to supply current to an explosive charge which forces a pin into the puncturable wall of a capsule containing compressed carbon dioxide whereby the float is inflated. The expansion of the top and bottom surfaces of the float, Fig. 3, erects the flexible whip aerial 26 which was coiled inside it, a lead 24 connecting the aerial to the transmitter and a portion 26a projecting through the top of the float. The float will remain substantially upright on land or water due to its shape and the weight of the inflator unit 38.

   The invention involves the use of a novel offset-printing process to apply the gasket seal on microdisplay arrays in a wafer scale manufacturing process. Gasket seal material is applied to an anilox roll, which has a matrix pattern of indentations or cells at a fixed line screen spacing and depth which corresponds to the desired height of the gasket material prior to contact with the glass layer. The amount of gasket material transferred to the substrate is controlled by the volume of the cells of the anilox roll. The anilox roll continuously rotates and excess material not filling in the cells is removed from the roll by a doctor blade. A letterpress, attached to a print roll, rolls in contact with the anilox roll and material is transferred from the anilox roll onto the letterpress. Raised portions of the letterpress apply a gasket design to the substrate in accordance with the matrix of multiple microdisplay devices. The letterpress and print roll rotate in contact with the substrate as the substrate is translated under the print roll, thus applying the gasket material to the substrate in the desired pattern.

When the eventvectors produce a cluster (  70  ) of particles in a multi-dimensional projection of the eventvectors, the computer signals that a possible new species has been found in the fluid. A background signature is generated for particles in the fluid when the fluid is safe. When new water is later passed through the apparatus, clusters of particles are searched for that are present in a much greater density than exists for the background signature for a safe fluid, to generate a signal indicating that the fluid may be unsafe.

Automatic exchange systems; Companders. WESTERN ELECTRIC CO. Inc. 27 Aug., 1969 [28 Aug., 1968], No. 42608/69. Headings H4K and H4R. Widely distributed subscribers, as in a rural situation, have short lines which are tee-connected to points along the length of a timedivision-multiplex bus which is looped through their area from an origination at a main exchange to a termination at that exchange, the bus providing fewer channels than there are subscribers and employing delta-modulation, a control circuit at the main exchange allocating a time slot on the bus for a connection and sending the identity of the slot to a subscriber's circuit providing the tee-connection with the bus and such as to store the slot identity so as to govern extraction of the appropriate bit train from the bit stream sent from the main exchange and to substitute a bit train for transmission to the main exchange. As described, 80 subscribers are concentrated on to 14 channels provided by the bus, the subscribers being arranged in small groups so that the subscribers of each group can be tee-connected to the bus at a common point, Fig. 1 not shown. The main exchange is equipped with a line circuit for each of the 80 subscribers and, as shown in Fig. 2, each line is connectible to channel units CH1 to CH14 by way of a 4-wire cross-bar switch 201, each channel unit corresponding to a time slot on the bus. Such connection employs the first two wires over the switch and is made to a channel unit preallotted by a scanner which steps over busy conditions present on the third wires of the switch outlets and comes to rest on the first idle outlet to operate the associated select magnet, Fig. 3, not shown. If all channels of the bus are busy the 15th and 16th outlets of the switch are preallotted to connect busy tone. The fourth wires of the switch, Fig. 4, are used for operation of the bridge magnets H1 to H80 and to generate codes identifying the subscriber to a connection and identifying the allotted time slot. A binary counter 404, stepping at the frame rate of the bus multiplex, by way of a 1-out-of-80 converter 406, scans the bridge magnets one-byone and, if a calling condition is present on a fourth wire SD1 to SD80 from the main exchange, the bridge magnet operates to connect the associated inlet to the preallotted outlet channel unit. The position of counter 404 identifies the subscriber's line appearance, and a so-called trunk translator 402, activated by the fourth wire of the seized outlet, produces the identity of the time slot constituting the channel. These identities are converted to serial form for transmission over the bus. At the subscriber' s tee-connection circuit to the bus the own line appearance code is recognized as it appears in the bit stream and effects a gating action to extract the immediately following time slot code for registration in the circuit so that the circuit may be suitably cycled to function in that time slot. Each time the counter 404 scans the switch inlet the line and slot codes are regenerated and transmitted to confirm the connection. The line code is generated at each scan invariably, whether a connection exists or not, and the transmission of this code effects a gating at the corresponding distant subscriber's teecircuit so as to return an indication of on-hook/ off-hook conditions. If an off-hook signal is received back from round the loop of the bus it occurs with the counter 404 still in its position marking the corresponding bridge-magnet and this causes the bridge-magnet to operate and set up a connection in the same way as if the connection had been initiated from the main exchange. On-hook/off-hook supervision also takes place over another supervisory channel to effect switching of the speech channel. Supervisory channels in the multiplex.-As seen in Fig. 5 the bit stream on the bus is composed of the repeated bit sequence TSS1, TSS2, TS1 to TS14, of which TSS1, TSS2, are supervisory bits and TS1 to TS14 are delta modulation channel bits. Each such sequence forms a group of which 16, GRS1, GRS2, and GR1 to GR14, comprises a cycle. Two cycles form a subframe and four cycles comprise a frame. The supervisory bits TSS1, TSS2, in any group relate to the correspondingly numbered TS speech channel and these bits in the groups during even cycles of the first subframes relate to two-digit codes transferred between syllabic compressors and expanders to indicate the step size at which the delta-modulators and demodulators should operate. The bits TSS2 of groups in odd cycles are used to relay ringing from the main exchange by controlling a ringing generator at a subscriber's distant teeconnection circuit and are used on the return portion of the bus to effect, at the channel units at the exchange, loop supervision of the distant subscribers. The 7-bit code identifying a subscriber's line appearance is sent from counter 404 and converter 405 as bits TSS1 in groups GRS1, GRS2, and GR1 to GR5 in odd cycles of the first sub-frame of a frame. In the same sub-framed odd cycles the bits TSS1 of groups GR6 to GR10 are used to transmit the code identifying the time slot of a connection as supplied from converter 403 and translator 402.

A slug is carried by the sleeve in the bore and has a metallic portion defining a first electrical contact. A spring is used to bias the slug into a position spaced away from the implement head. A second electrical contact is positioned to engage the first contact when a preset centripetal force urges the slug to travel toward the implement head when the implement is swung with sufficient force. An indicator emits an audible signal and emits the signal as the implements reaches the preset centrifugal force threshhold. Sufficient centripetal force thus moves the slug and causes it to engage the first and second contacts closing a circuit to the indicator. The apparatus can be adjusted to measure different centripeal threshholds. The performer receives audible information at the moment of peak centripeal force. Ideally, that moment should occur at impact.

The laser beam has a horizontal width (W) that is a plurality of times as great as its average vertical thickness (T), to increase the number of particles passing through the zone while minimizing the time of each particle in the zone. A quadrant detector (  48  ) that is used to detect deviation of the laser beam from a predetermined path, is oriented about 45 from the usual direction. The laser beam is generated by a diode laser (  82  ) whose output passes through two appropriately-positioned cylindrical lenses (  84, 86  ) to produce the desired the ratio of width (W) to thickness (T).

   Phosphorescent taggants are used for characterizing and optimizing the mass distribution of a liquid composition deposited on a solid substrate and of components within a blend of particulate materials. The taggant is deposited on the surface of a solid substrate in the presence of a liquid composition to form a tagged substrate, and upon exposure to light for a sufficient period of time, the tagged substrate emits phosphorescence, which is detected visually, photographically or photometrically. The spacial pattern of phosphorescence emitted from the tagged substrate is indicative of the mass distribution of the liquid composition on the solid substrate or of the tagged substrate within a blend of the tagged substrate with another particulate material.

Under normal operating conditions, both the stop (upstream) and intercept (downstream) valves are opened providing a relatively unrestricted passage for the flow of steam. During a turbine overspeed condition when the turbine speed reaches 103% of rated speed, the intercept valve closes substantially all the way. The stop valve backs up the intercept valve. Should the turbine speed reach 108% of rated speed, the stop valve closes completely shutting off the flow of steam to the low-pressure turbine. When opened, the discs partially overlie each other so that any wakes in the steam flow produced by the stop disc will not cause the intercept disc to flutter. The interior of the casing is provided with annular grooves which receive valve seats with which the discs mate in a face sealing arrangement.

    An engine crankshaft torque observer (  10  ) and method of operation. An engine combustion process (  14  ) is modeled (  26  ) to develop modeled pressure estimates of combustion chamber pressures in engine cylinders according to certain engine inputs, such as fuel (  20  ), EGR (  22  ), and timing (  24  ), that influence combustion chamber pressures. Kinematics (  16  ) relating reciprocal motion of pistons in the engine cylinders to an engine crankshaft and engine friction (  18  ) relating running friction of the engine to engine crankshaft rotation are also modeled (  28; 30  ). A processor processes the certain engine inputs through the combustion process model to develop modeled pressure estimates which are processed through the kinematics model to develop modeled positive torque contribution due to combustion processes and through the friction model to develop modeled torque loss due to running friction. The modeled positive torque contribution due to combustion processes and the modeled torque loss due to running friction are processed to develop a measurement of indicted torque output of the engine. The combustion process model for developing modeled pressure estimates of combustion chamber pressures in engine cylinders is also novel.

Under normal operating conditions, both the stop (upstream) and intercept (downstream) valves are opened providing a relatively unrestricted passage for the flow of steam. During a turbine overspeed condition when the turbine speed reaches 103% of rated speed, the intercept valve closes substantially all the way. The stop valve backs up the intercept valve. Should the turbine speed reach 108% of rated speed, the stop valve closes completely shutting off the flow of steam to the low-pressure turbine. When opened, the discs partially overlie each other so that any wakes in the stream flow produced by the stop disc will not cause the intercept disc to flutter. The interior of the casing is provided with annular grooves which receive valve seats with which the discs mate in a face sealing arrangement. The positions of the seats in the grooves may be adjusted in an axial direction to maintain optimum sealing with the discs when the shafts flex under the pressure of the steam flow.",GEN ELECTRIC,DAVIS DONALD H;;MOSSEY JOHN G,,https://lens.org/150-584-733-524-583,Granted Patent,no,0,0,9,9,0,F16K1/22;;F16K1/22;;F01D17/145;;F01D17/145;;Y10T137/87917;;Y10T137/87917,F01D17/10;;F01D17/14;;F01D21/16;;F16K1/22,137-135,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A loading device is disclosed for loading and unloading a load relative to a horizontally disposed bed of a truck. The device includes a gliding arrangement secured to a first end of the load, the gliding arrangement engaging a rear end of the bed of the truck when the truck is reversed towards the gliding arrangement. A leg is secured to a second end of the load such that the load is disposed substantially between the gliding arrangement and the leg. A lifting mechanism is secured to the leg for selectively lifting and lowering the leg. Additionally, a support is pivotally secured to the load between the gliding arrangement and the leg. The arrangement is such that in a first disposition of the device, the lifting mechanism is adjusted to a lifted mode so that the leg is lifted such that the second end of the load is disposed higher than the first end of the load. The truck is then reversed towards the gliding arrangement such that the gliding arrangement engages the rear end of the bed of the truck. In a second disposition of the device, when the truck is further reversed towards the second end of the load, the support pivots towards the load due to contact of the support with the truck. In a third disposition of the device, when the truck has been yet further reversed so that the load is disposed above the bed of the truck, the lifting mechanism is adjusted to a lowered mode such that the second end of the load is supported on the bed of the truck.

The system provides a real-time readout of the spin rate, and requires no instrumentation aboard the projectile except for a small plane mirror that is attached obliquely to one end of the spinning projectile. The system directs a collimated beam of light that is reflected off the plane mirror back into the system where it traverses a stationary reticle that has alternating transparent and opaque sectors thereon. The frequency with which the light passes through the transparent portions of the reticle provides a direct indication of the spin rate of the rotating member.

   A fluidic actuator includes a central elastic tube with an interior bore and a surrounding sheath formed of braided fibers. End fittings are attached to the tube and sheath at first and second ends thereof and include a cap with a hollow cavity into which an end section of the tube and sheath are inserted and embedded in a hardened adhesive. The hardened adhesive seals off the ends of the tube and strongly bonds the fibers of the sheath to the end caps to provide strong mechanical connections. A fluid coupling may extend through one of the end caps to connection to an end of the tube, with an interior bore in the coupling in communication with the bore in the tube to allow fluid under pressure to be supplied to the interior of the tube. A liquid lubricant may be held in the fibers of the sheath to provide lubrication between the elastic tube and the fibers of the sheath to reduce wear and abrasion of the tube and extend the service life of the actuator.

[Also in Division H3] In a magnetic type mass spectrometer the ion beam accelerating voltage is varied by a pulse of combined rectangular and sawtooth form to sweep the mass spectrum. The composite pulse is derived from a circuit (see Division H3) which develops a rectangular pulse from sawtooth pulse and then combines the two pulses, the magnitude and duration of the individual pulses being such that the composite pulse has high and low levels sufficient for two spaced mass ranges in the mass spectrum to be swept while an intermediate range of masses is omitted. The mass spectrometer includes a resiliently mounted ion source assembly composed of a stack of ion source, and ion beam focusing and collimating plates mounted on common support rods to which is also secured the curved analyser tube. The ion source is of the electron bombardment type with a central mesh cage in which the ions are generated. On either side of the cage is an electron emitting filament, one of which is a spare, and a backing plate supports two curved magnetic polepieces located behind the filaments. The ion detector is preferably an electron multiplier with the output lead brought out through an aperture in the side of the envelope to avoid leakage currents.",GEN ELECTRIC,DAVIS WILLIAM DONALD;;VANDERSLICE THOMAS AQUINAS,,https://lens.org/097-826-454-244-940,Granted Patent,no,0,3,3,5,0,H01J49/26;;H01J49/26;;H01J49/022;;H01J49/022;;H01J49/025;;H01J49/025;;H01J49/10;;H01J49/10;;H01J49/30;;H01J49/30,H01J49/02;;H01J49/10;;H01J49/26;;H01J49/30,H1D DH            MG;;H1D DM            MG;;H1D DMG           MG;;H1D D10           MG;;H1D D14B          MG;;H1D D15B          MG;;H1D D17AY         MG;;H1D D17A2A        MG;;H1D D17A2Y        MG;;H1D D21C          MG;;H1D D21D          MG;;H1D D21X          MG;;H1D D44           MG;;H1D D51           MG;;H1D D9CY          MG;;H1D D9C1X         MG;;H1D D9C1Y         MG;;H1D D9H           MG;;H1D D9Y           MG;;H3P PLX           PLX;;H3P P1A1          -;;H3P P1M4          -;;H3P P1M5B         -;;H3P P2C4          -;;H3P P2G           -;;H3P P3G           -;;H3P P3K           -;;H3P P4T1          -;;H3P P4U           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The circuit comprises a low gain current switch including a first and second switching transistors (12, 14), with the control lines of the switching transistors connected to a reference voltage line (38). The reference crystal is connected across the control input (22) and the current receiving (23) terminals of the first transistor so that a square wave is obtained at the current receiving terminal (25) of the second transistor. A threshold circuit (42, 44, 46, 48, 50) is included for adjusting the voltage of the square wave signal from the second transistor and applying the adjusted signal to a diode-coupled receiver circuit, which provides the output for the circuit. This oscillator circuit provides a double action noise immunity through the use of a low gain current switch to prevent noise amplification, in combination with a diode-coupled receiver which is affected by noise only during signal transitions. A duty cycle very close to fifty percent is realized by the circuit.

The holding tool helps reduce twisting of the first portion relative to the second portion when torque is applied. The holding tool also communicates with a controller when the tool is in use. For example, the tool communicates with the controller in response to a user applying a force to the tool in a direction of the first portion the tool is engaged with. That force releases pressure on a switch that activates a communication signal for communication to the controller. This allows the controller to monitor whether the holding tool was used in conjunction with a torque wrench to tighten the coupling; thereby providing an error reducing function. 17474862_1 (GHMatters) P107411.AU.2",SNAP ON INCORPORATED,REYNERTSON JOHN;;REYNERTSON DONALD J;;DAVIS PAUL E,,https://lens.org/060-887-985-769-339,Patent Application,no,0,0,20,26,0,B25B23/14;;B25B23/141;;B25B23/1415;;B25B23/142;;B25F1/02;;B25B23/1425;;B25B23/0085;;B25B23/1425;;B25B23/1425;;B25G1/085;;G01L25/003;;B25B13/468;;B25B15/04;;B25F1/02,B25B23/14,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The holding tool helps reduce twisting of the first portion relative to the second portion when torque is applied. The 5 holding tool also communicates with a controller when the tool is in use. For example, the tool communicates with the controller in response to a user applying a force to the tool in a direction of the first portion the tool is engaged with. That force releases pressure on a switch that activates a communication signal for communication to the controller. This allows the controller to monitor whether the holding tool was used in conjunction with a torque wrench to tighten the coupling; thereby providing an error reducing 10 function. 11870487_1 (GHMatters) P107411.AU.1",SNAP ON TOOLS CORP,REYNERTSON JOHN;;REYNERTSON DONALD J;;DAVIS PAUL E,,https://lens.org/076-217-463-586-373,Patent Application,no,0,0,20,26,0,B25B23/14;;B25B23/141;;B25B23/1415;;B25B23/142;;B25F1/02;;B25B23/1425;;B25B23/0085;;B25B23/1425;;B25B23/1425;;B25G1/085;;G01L25/003;;B25B13/468;;B25B15/04;;B25F1/02,B25B23/14,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The holding tool helps reduce twisting of the first portion relative to the second portion when torque is applied. The holding tool also communicates with a controller when the tool is in use. For example, the tool communicates with the controller in response to a user applying a force to the tool in a direction of the first portion the tool is engaged with. That force releases pressure on a switch that activates a communication signal for communication to the controller. This allows the controller to monitor whether the holding tool was used in conjunction with a torque wrench to tighten the coupling; thereby providing an error reducing function. q748534_1 (GHMatters) P107411.AU CC \4 N C N Vl",SNAP ON INCORPORATED,REYNERTSON JOHN;;REYNERTSON DONALD J;;DAVIS PAUL E,,https://lens.org/167-363-341-077-049,Patent Application,no,0,0,20,26,0,B25B23/14;;B25B23/141;;B25B23/1415;;B25B23/142;;B25F1/02;;B25B23/1425;;B25B23/0085;;B25B23/1425;;B25B23/1425;;B25G1/085;;G01L25/003;;B25B13/468;;B25B15/04;;B25F1/02,B25B23/14,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The holding tool helps reduce twisting of the first portion relative to the second portion when torque is applied. The holding tool also communicates with a controller when the tool is in use. For example, the tool communicates with the controller in response to a user applying a force to the tool in a direction of the first portion the tool is engaged with. That force releases pressure on a switch that activates a communication signal for communication to the controller. This allows the controller to monitor whether the holding tool was used in conjunction with a torque wrench to tighten the coupling; thereby providing an error reducing function.",SNAP ON TOOLS CORP,REYNERTSON JR JOHN;;REYNERTSON DONALD J;;DAVIS PAUL E,SNAP-ON INCORPORATED (2018-01-08),https://lens.org/120-172-327-180-886,Granted Patent,yes,53,1,20,26,0,B25B23/14;;B25B23/141;;B25B23/1415;;B25B23/142;;B25F1/02;;B25B23/1425;;B25B23/0085;;B25B23/1425;;B25B23/1425;;B25G1/085;;G01L25/003;;B25B13/468;;B25B15/04;;B25F1/02,B25B23/142;;B25B13/46;;B25B15/04;;B25F1/02;;B25G1/08;;G01L25/00;;G10L25/00,,19,0,,,"UK Office Action for Application No. GB1720015.5, dated Jan. 30, 2019, 3 pages.;;Park Tool, Torque Specifications and Concepts, Aug. 25, 2015, 13 pages.;;Sturtevant Richmont, When Tool Failure is not an Option, Apr. 26, 2016, 16 pages.;;Taiwan Office Action for Application No. 106142341 dated Jun. 26, 2018, 10 pages.;;Canadian Office Action for Application No. 2,925,579 dated Jun. 23, 2016, 3 pages.;;Taiwan Office Action and Search Report for Application No. 103115640 dated Oct. 21, 2015, 6 pages.;;TW Office Action for Application No. 107139259 dated May 7, 2019, 4 pages.;;CN Office Action for Application No. 201711261048.8 dated Mar. 4, 2019, 7 pages.;;Combined Search and Examination Report for UK Application No. GB1720015.5 dated May 23, 2018, 8 pages.;;Australian Examination Report No. 1 for Application No. 2017268673 dated Nov. 16, 2018, 4 pages.;;Canadian Office Action for Application No. 2,987,501 dated Nov. 14, 2018, 3 pages.;;Taiwan Office Action for Application No. 106142341 dated Dec. 4, 2018, 2 pages.;;Torque Specifications and Concepts, dated Aug. 25, 2015, 13 pages.;;Sturtevant Richmont, “When Tool Failure is not an Option,” dated Apr. 26, 2016, 16 pages.;;United Kingdom Combined Search and Examination Report for Application No. GB19070861, dated Nov. 7, 2019, 5 pages.;;Chinese Office Action for Application No. 201711261048.8 dated Nov. 4, 2019, 6 pages.;;Chinese Office Action for Application No. 201711261048.8 dated Jun. 2, 2020, 4 pages.;;Australian Examination Report No. 1 for Application No. 2019264654 dated Oct. 15, 2020, 5 pages.;;Chinese Office Action for Application No. 201711261048.8 dated Dec. 31, 2020, 6 pages.",ACTIVE

For example, the tool communicates with the controller in response to a user applying a force to the tool in a direction of the first portion the tool is engaged with. That force releases pressure on a switch that activates a communication signal for communication to the controller. This allows the controller to monitor whether the holding tool was used in conjunction with a torque wrench to tighten the coupling; thereby providing an error reducing function.",SNAP ON TOOLS CORP,REYNERTSON JR JOHN;;REYNERTSON DONALD J;;DAVIS PAUL E,SNAP-ON INCORPORATED (2018-01-08),https://lens.org/109-949-989-870-124,Patent Application,yes,5,3,20,26,0,B25B23/14;;B25B23/141;;B25B23/1415;;B25B23/142;;B25F1/02;;B25B23/1425;;B25B23/0085;;B25B23/1425;;B25B23/1425;;B25G1/085;;G01L25/003;;B25B13/468;;B25B15/04;;B25F1/02,B25B23/142;;B25B15/04;;B25G1/08,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

   A system and methods are disclosed that permit mobile code, such as an applet, to create a network connection with a content server on a network, without exposing the client computer that is running the applet, or other computers with which the client computer may communicate, to a DNS spoofing attack. This is achieved in accordance with the principles of the present invention by using network restriction software in the execution engine or runtime system under which the applet executes. When the applet attempts to create a network connection to a content server, the network restriction software checks a name directory on the content server for the presence of an entry whose name corresponds to the name of the computer from which the applet was downloaded. If such an entry is present, then the network restriction software permits the network connection between the applet and the content server to be created. If not, the applet may not create a network connection with the content server. Additionally, address checks may be applied to assist in preventing DNS spoofing attacks from succeeding.

    The present invention is directed to an integrated, reflective bistable, cholesteric liquid crystal display and solar cell assembly providing electrical energy to power display electronics. The liquid crystal display includes the layer of cholesteric liquid crystal material sandwiched between first and second transparent substrates. An inner surface of the first substrate and an inner surface of the second substrate bound the layer of liquid crystal material and the first substrate is closest to a viewer of the display. A first set of conductive electrodes is disposed on the inner surface of the first substrate and a second set of conductive electrodes is disposed on the inner surface of the second substrate. Display driver circuitry is electrically coupled to the first and the second sets of conductive electrodes for generating desired voltage differentials between electrodes of the first set of conductive electrodes and electrodes of the second set of conductive electrodes. A solar cell assembly that is provided includes a solar cell or solar panel positioned behind the second substrate and electrically coupled to a rechargeable energy storage device, such as a rechargeable battery. The solar cell receives illumination passing through the first substrate, liquid crystal material and the second substrate and converts the illumination incident on the solar cell to electrical energy to supply power to the rechargeable energy storage device. The cholesteric liquid crystal material permits transmission of incident light regardless of the configuration of the liquid crystal material.

The cell is divided into a reaction chamber, as drift chamber and an ion collector chamber by transverse shutter grids normally carrying an ion repellent charge. The inlet of a chromatograph analytical column is connected to the outlet of the cell ion collector chamber. Inert gas admitted to the ion collector chamber is divided into a drift gas stream and into an oppositely directed carrier gas stream. The drift gas flows from the collector chamber through the drift chamber and out the reaction chamber. The carrier gas flows from the collector chamber through a deionizer into the chromatograph column. An electrostatic field urges sample gas ions from the reaction chamber toward the ion collection chamber. The ions are blocked from entering or exiting from the intervening drift chamber by the charge on the shutter grids. At selected times the repellent charges are removed from the shutter grids to allow a group of sample gas ions to traverse the drift chamber and enter the ion collection chamber. Such ions become entrained in the carrier gas stream and are transported thereby through the deionizer into the chromatograph column. The waveform of the current induced in the deionizer by sample gas ions passing therethrough provides information on the time, volume and shape of the gas sample admitted to the chromatograph column.",ALLIED CORP,CAMPBELL DONALD N;;VORA KISHORE N;;DAVIS JR ROBERT C,ALLIED CORPORATION (1985-03-04);;ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL SYSTEMS INC.

Within each housing, the optical fiber of the respective cable is secured within a ceramic ferrule that extends axially of the connector. The endface of each optical fiber is exposed at the end of its respective ferrule. The ends of the ferrules are ground and polished in such a way that the endfaces of the optical fibers exhibit a planar undercut with respect to the lip of the axial passageway in which the fibers are secured. When the ferrules are brought and pressed together end-to-end as the connectors are mated, the material of each ferrule compresses until the endfaces of the optical fibers engage each other with near null pressure. The result is the near elimination of pressure on the optical fiber itself, which avoids a density and index of refraction change at the junction and thus improves return loss performance.

The connector comprises matable connector housings that terminate the ends of respective optical cables to be joined. Within each housing, the optical fiber of the respective cable is secured within a ceramic ferrule that extends axially of the connector. The endface of each optical fiber is exposed at the end of its respective ferrule. The ends of the ferrules are ground and polished in such a way that the endfaces of the optical fibers exhibit a planar undercut with respect to the lip of the axial passageway in which the fibers are secured. When the ferrules are brought and pressed together end-to-end as the connectors are mated, the material of each ferrule compresses until the endfaces of the optical fibers engage each other with near null pressure. The result is the near elimination of pressure on the optical fiber itself, which avoids a density and index of refraction change at the junction and thus improves return loss performance.
