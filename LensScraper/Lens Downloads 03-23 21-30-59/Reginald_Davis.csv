Boiler walls; forced flow steam boilers. INTERNATIONAL COMBUSTION (HOLDINGS) Ltd. March 17, 1961 [March 18, 1960], No. 9777/60. Headings F4A and F4B. The walls of a steam boiler each comprise an evaporating circuit fed by groups 1 or 2 of tubes arranged to take the water straight down and slowly upwards through pipe loops 3-8. Each loop is supported between the groups 1, 2 of supply tubes by a plate girder arrangement consisting of an upper channel member 15 (Fig. 5), a metal spacing sheet 22 (not shown in Fig. 1), and a lower channel member 20, there being intermediate vertical T-bars 21 as stiffeners (Fig. 6). Lugs 17 welded to vertical support bars 16, welded in turn to the pipes of each loop, are connected via pins 19 to webs 18 arranged across the channel members 15 and 20, the lugs and webs being spaced apart at the upper connections to allow for differential horizontal movement, and elongate dots being provided at the lower connections to allow for differential vertical movement. The lower channel members 20 rest on brackets welded to pipes of groups 1 or 2, whilst the upper channel members 15 form a sliding connection therewith (Fig. 6). Spaces 28 or 29 may be used at loop corners (Fig. 7), and tongue and groove joints adjacent vertical or horizontal pipe sections. The casing is formed by covering the backs of the loops with a plastic refractory lining, and then with insulating material. Horizontal girt members, attached across the backs of the channel members, and joined at the corners of the chamber, serve to resist any pressure from a fuel explosion. The boiler is pivotally supported from the roof.",INT COMBUSTION HOLDINGS LTD,DAVIS REGINALD FRANK,,https://lens.org/185-489-773-972-529,Granted Patent,no,0,1,6,6,0,F22B37/68;;F22B37/68,F22B37/68,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

INTERNATIONAL COMPUTORS & TABULATORS Ltd. Jan. 6, 1959 [Feb. 12, 1958], No. 4586/58. Class 97(1) [Also in Group IX] A spool for winding or unwinding a roll of film comprises a side plate to which is secured a fixed member for receiving a driving shaft, two or more arcuate members disposed around, and movable radially relative to, the rotational axis of the spool and resiliently urged towards an outer position to form a hub for the film and manually retractable towards an inner position to release the wound film. As shown, side plates 1 and 2 are screwthreadedly, connected to members 3 and 4 by studs 6 and 15 coacting with radial and tapered slots 7 and 14. As a bushing 9 (secured to plate 1) is positioned on a shaft 13, a chamfered portion and a slot therein engage a projection on one arm of a bell-crank lever 11 to rock the lever and lock the other arm against the head of one stud 6. The film may be wound on a removable gripper 17 under a tag 18 of which, or under a similar tag on member 3 or 4, one end of the film is anchored. The roll is released by removing plate 2 and pressing the studs 6, and therefore the member 3 and 4, inwards against springs 8: inward movement of studs to their limit frees the spool from the shaft 13. The members 3, 4, may be held in winding position by a cam or locking lever (not shown). The plate 2 may be dispensed with and the diameter of the plate reduced, if guides are provided for winding film on or off the spool. The lever 11 is unnecessary if bushing 9 is permanently secured to shaft 13. Slots 14 may be replaced by spring-catches (not shown).

Each antenna element has a slot element (60-74) formed in the ground plane and a respective loading element (80-94) located within each slot element. The antenna elements being arranged in a regular array where each respective slot element is sequentially rotated in space with respect to adjacent slot elements, and the loading elements generate a perturbation under excitation. A microstrip feed network (100) is located on the underside of the substrate to provide excitation to each slot element, and including feeds of different lengths to be electrically sequentially rotated in common with spatial rotation of the slot elements. A single microstrip feed point (108) extends to the edge of the substrate for connection purposes. A reflecting plane is located parallel to and spaced apart from the underside of the substrate.

The reduction can be performed during a minimally invasive procedure for implanting spinal stabilization systems. A sleeve can include internal threads that match threads on the respective collar to form a continuous set of threads. Threads on a closure member can be engaged with the threads on the sleeve and the closure member turned to translate the closure member along the sleeve. The closure member can be used to push a rod relative to the collar to which the sleeve is attached to cause a vertebral body to move.,ZIMMER SPINE INC,MILLER PETER THOMAS;;FORTON CHARLES R;;RICEMAN BRUCE A;;KHOO LARRY T;;DAVIS REGINALD J;;HISEY MICHAEL SCOTT,ZIMMER BIOMET SPINE INC (2016-09-30),https://lens.org/143-995-221-714-765,Granted Patent,yes,50,3,7,7,0,A61B17/7091;;A61B17/7091,A61B17/70,,37,0,,,"“U.S. Appl.
