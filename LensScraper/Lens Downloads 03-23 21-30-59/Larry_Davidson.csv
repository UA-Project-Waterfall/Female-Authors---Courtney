The nodes together are configured to maintain an immutable record as a blockchain, based on commands provided by the protocol entity. A member may provide a request for a transaction to the protocol entity to perform an operation along with encrypted data. For example, the operation may include a transaction. The protocol entity may invoke a smart contract at one or more nodes to perform the operation on the encrypted data. In response, the node decrypts the encrypted data using a decryption key stored in the node storage equipment to generate cleartext data.

The present invention provides an Actuator Control Electronics (ACE) wrap-back module that monitors the output of the normal mode control module and switches control to the direct control module based upon the detection of an error condition. The switching function is controlled by a monitoring system that monitors the output from an integrated heartbeat module that emits a pre-programmed signal. The pre-programmed signal is encoded and sent over a communication bus where it is then decoded and validated by comparing the decoded signal to the expected results.
