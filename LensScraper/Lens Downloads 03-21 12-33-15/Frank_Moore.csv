Selective-printing apparatus. CREED & CO. Ltd. May 20, 1964, No. 20770/64. Heading B6F. Apparatus for feeding a printing medium D in steps through a printing machine, e.g. a teleprinter, which steps may be greater or less than or equal to a line space, comprises a roller 1 around which the medium D passes, ratchet- and-pawl means 7, 8 for rotating the roller 1, an input member 23 movable from a rest position in direction A and with a fixed throw to actuate the devices 7, 8, and an interposer 37 which in the rest position of the member 23 causes the pawl 8 to be moved clear of the ratchet wheel 7. In the rest position, the roller 1 can be rotated manually by a knob 49. An extension of the shaft 4 of the roller 1 carries the ratchet wheel 7 and the knob 49. A frame 12 is pivoted on the shaft 4 and one limb 16 thereof has a lever arm 20 with notches 21 on its upper edge, one of the notches being engaged by a pin 22 on the input member 23 and the particular notch engaged determining the extent of the feed step as described below. Another limb 11 of the frame 12 carries the pawl 8 which is spring-urged towards the wheel 7. Downward movement of the input member 23 effected, e.g. electromagnetically by a signal, causes a downward movement of the pawl 8 which movement releases the pawl from a tongue 40 holding the pawl away from the wheel 8 so that the pawl 7 engages the wheel 8 and rotates the roller 1. The tongue 40 is part of the interposer 37 which is pivoted on the shaft 4 and has an arm 38 pivoted by a pin 31 to a part 28 of a lever 24 pivoted on a fixed shaft 25. The pin 31 is engaged in one of a number of notches 21 in a pivoted arm 32, these notches corresponding to the notches 21 in lever arm 20. The arms 20, 32 are biased upwardly by springs 35, 34 respectively. At the end of the lever 24 opposite to that carrying the part 28 is a forked arm 30 engaging the pin 22, and also a key portion 29. Pivoted movement of the lever 24 in the direction E, effected by manual or electromagnetic operation of the key portion 29, causes the pins 22, 31 to be moved into the next adjacent notches 21. This causes (a) lengthening of the effective length of lever arm 20 and a decrease in the throw of the pawl 8 corresponding to one tooth of wheel 7, (b) a momentary movement of the frame 12 which brings the pawl 8 adjacent to the next lower tooth of wheel 7 and (c) a movement of tongue 40 to hold the pawl 8 away from the wheel 7 in the new position of rest. As described, with the pins 22, 31 engaged with the leftward notches 21 a feed of two line spaces is obtained corresponding to four teeth of ratchet wheel 7, and rightward shift of the pins effects a reduction of half a line spacing corresponding to one tooth of ratchet wheel 7 at each step. To provide for feeds of more than two line spaces, or less than one line space, additional notches 21 would be necessary. A roller 43 mounted on a spring-urged arm 41 engages the teeth of wheel 7 to hold the wheel stationary whilst the pawl 8 is inoperative. When the shaft 4 is rotated by the knob 49, the amount of feed movement imparted to the rollers is indicated aurally by the clicks made by the roller 43 as the teeth pass over it.",CREED & CO LTD,MOORE FRANK ARTHUR,,https://lens.org/113-818-226-094-459,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H04L13/06,H04L13/06,B6F FKM           KM;;B6F FKX           36;;B6F F6B12RY       KX;;B6F F6B12R10      KX;;B6F F6B12Y        KX;;B6F F6B14N        KX;;B6F F6B14Y        KX;;B6F F6D4          KX;;B6F F6G3B5        KX;;B6F F6G3B6        KX;;B6F F6G3C         KX;;B6F F6R5T         KX;;B6F F6R5Y         KX,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

April 18, 1962, No. 15071/62. Class 100 (4) Type-wheel machines; type carriages.-A printing mechanism for a teleprinter comprises a typehead 1, Fig. 1, mounted on a carriage 2 supported on a rocking shaft 3 so that both the typehead and the carriage may be rocked from a rest position in Fig. 2 to a printing position in Fig. 1, about the shaft 3 in the direction A, to print a character on a transparent printing medium 4. The typehead 1 is displaceable vertically upwards to effect printing and is lowered to occupy the position shown in dotted outline, in Fig. 2, in the rest position. Paper and matrix carriages and supports.- The carriage 2 has slidably mounted thereon a bar 20, Fig. 1, having stub ends, each carrying a pair of half-links 18, pivotally attached with one end to cranked members 14 engaging trunnion blocks 13, carried by arms 9, to which is attached a platen bar 8. As the typehead and the carriage are rocked into printing position, the links 18 pivot the cranked members 14 clockwise until they abut stops 22, Fig. 1, whereby the arms 9 are urged anti-clockwise by a spring 11, to displace the platen bar 8 from the rest position in Fig. 2, to the printing position in Fig. 1. Paper, web feeding and guiding arrangements. The transparent printing medium 4, in Fig. 1, is guided by a roller 5, formed by a usual roller-type printing platen and the printing medium is supported by the platen bar 8 in both its rest and printing position. Printing and visual indication.-The platen bar 8 is moved into the path of the typehead to a printing position just before a printing operation is to take place and retracted immediately after, into its rest position, together with the typehead as shown in outline in Fig. 2, so that a character just printed, together with others of a line or lines of print may be projected on to a screen 29, by a light source 24, condensing lens assembly 25, transparent printing medium 4, mirrors 26 and 28 and a projector lens assembly 27. The speed with which the characters are printed and the platen bar moved into and out of the path of the typehead is such that the lines of print are visible throughout the printing operation.",CREED & CO LTD,MOORE FRANK ARTHUR,,https://lens.org/121-133-671-869-409,Granted Patent,no,0,0,5,6,0,B41B21/34;;B41J29/19;;H04L13/182;;H04L13/188;;B41B21/34;;B41J29/19;;H04L13/182;;H04L13/188,B41B21/34;;B41J29/19;;H04L13/18,B6F FMK5          MK;;B6F F6B9A         MK;;B6F F6B9Y         MK;;B6F F6D5B         MK;;B6F F6D6          MK;;B6F F6D8DY        MK;;B6F F6D8D2        MK;;B6F F7BY          MK;;B6F F7B3A         MK;;B6F F7B3Y         MK,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Moore, F., and Palmer, J. Oct. 20. Circular knitting-machines.-Relates to a modification of the circular rib latch-needle machine on which work in imitation of seamless fashioned hosiery may be made. The transference from rib to plain loops is effected by hand, the needlecontrolling passages being so shaped that the plain needles required for receiving the transferred rib loops are out of action while the leg is being made, and are subsequently raised into action. The heel and toe pouches are formed by splicing and slackening the loops of the heel and toe portions, the corresponding loops having been previously stiffened during the formation of the leg fabric. The heel and toe partings are imitated by one or more partial tuck courses made by special shortbutted needles. These are normally operated by a sliding portion of the clearance cam, which is depressed at the proper times out of range of the tuck-stitch needles by the action of studs or stops e<1> on a pattern chain. Another stud d determines the commencement of the heel and toe pouches by acting on a bell-crank f, which allows the splicing and loop-varying mechanisms to come into action. The stitch-cam is slidable vertically, and is operated by a slotted sliding rod h connected to the bell-crank f and carrying inclines. An horizontal crank-arm h<3> carrying screws h<4>, h<2> is continuously reciprocated by a lever i running on a rotary cam k, and according as the incline h' or depression h<5> is under a screw h<2>, h<4>, so the stitch cam is intermittently depressed to draw long loops round a portion of the fabric tube, or is pushed up by a spring to draw correspondingly short loops. The splicing-mechanism is pivotally suspended at b<4> from a bracket-piece, and is intermittently operated, when released by the inward movement of the upper end of the bell-crank f, by means of a rotary cam b<1> against which a bearing-surface b<2> is held by a spring. The chain-wheel is operated by a ratchet-wheel p<1> and a pawl p constantly reciprocated by a lever q and cam. The speed of the wheel p<1> can be reduced by means of a cam p<3> pivoted at p<2> and actuated by a lever o<2> and projections on the pattern chain ; when the cam p<3> is moved to the position shown in full lines in Fig. 5, it acts as a bluff and the pawl p drives the wheel p<1> only one tooth at each reciprocation instead of two. The lever q may be held out of range of its cam by a latch q engaging the catch q<2>.",MOORE FRANK;;PALMER JAMES,MOORE FRANK;;PALMER JAMES,,https://lens.org/140-745-640-021-321,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Moore, F., and Palmer, J. May 27. Circular knitting- machines.-To produce embroidery over plain fabric during the course of manufacture, a set of kneed feeders a<4> arranged radially in a dial are directed alternately into and .out of action by an cut-throw cam controlled by a starwheel b<1>. -To traverse the embroidery threads over the fabric, the feeder dial is shogged at intervals by means of pattern-wheels carried below the bed. The dial can be shogged either during the courses in which the feeders are projected, or in the succeeding courses while the feeders are retracted. In the first case, the embroidery threads traverse over the front of the needles and are knitted in. In the second case, the threads traverse behind the needles and float on the reverse side of the fabric. Patternwheels d, d' for ordinary embroidery and the bracelet respectively, are used. To commence the bracelet, the machine is first stopped and a sleeve carrying the wheels d, d' is moved by hand to bring the wheel d<1> against a lever c<2>, the forked upper end of which is connected to the feeder dial. On completion of the bracelet, a cam on the wheel d acting on a fixed incline displaces the sleeve, bringing the wheel d against the lever c<2>. Provision is made for holding the dial and the lever c<2> in the position in which they are placed by the pattern-wheels. For making more complicated embroidery patterns, a multi-part dial with relative movement between the parts can be used.",MOORE FRANK;;PALMER JAMES,MOORE FRANK;;PALMER JAMES,,https://lens.org/146-827-951-556-187,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Moore, F., and Palmer, E. W. Feb. 22. Circular knitting-machines.-The leg-fashioning of seamless hosiery is effected automatically by removing loops from two cylinder needles and transferring to rib needles every few courses, starting from the centre of the back and working outwards, the knitting being continued with a smaller number of loops. The transfer needles a are provided with hooks or catches ax, Figs. 14 and 15, for spreading the loops, which are received on the web holders s and are subsequently removed therefrom by adjacent rib needles projected by suitable cams. To commence the fashioning, a slide d is pulled and acts on the elevating and depressing cams f, n, Figs. 11 and 12, by bringing a pawl d' into engagement with a ratchet provided with a notched pindisk h on which rest the outer ends of levers i, o. When the disk h arrives at the position shown, the projections k<1>, i<1> are respectively depressed and elevated. This brings the inner end of one lever i into the plane of a roller f attached to a swinging cross-piece, which assumes the position shown in dotted lines in Fig. 9 and diaws a wedge piece f<2> away from a stud on the stem of the spring-pressed cam f. This then slides round on the upper butts a<1> of the fashioning-needles until the point is reached where a fashioning - needle is omitted. The cam f then drops into this gap, and the two needles on opposite sides of the gap are elevated by the inclines f<x>, f<xx .>These needles are then taken to the transfer point by the cam e, Fig. 7, which subsequently depresses them on to the lowering-cam n, Fig. 12. The cam e is brought into action by turning a handle c which releases the spring-pressed stem from a face cam in the handle. The elevated needles are sprung over into the transfer position by engagement with an angle-piece m<1>. When the loops have been transferred, the onward movement of the ratchet depresses the projection i<1> and elevates the projection k<1>. A roller f<4> situated in a different plane from the roller f<1> is then engaged by the lever i to put the camf out of action for a number of courses.",MOORE FRANK;;PALMER ERNEST WILLIAM,MOORE FRANK;;PALMER ERNEST WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/016-699-215-220-821,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,D04B9/20;;D04B15/02;;D04B15/34,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

MOORE. 14 July, 1969 [20 July, 1968], No. 34711/68. Heading A1D. An agricultural sowing machine comprises a frame 13 for mounting arm assemblies 36 which carry soil cutting discs 42, these being resilient means 50, 55 urging the arm assemblies away from the frame, and a resilient connection 29 between the frame and a member 11 connected to the frame, the adjustment of which connection alters the loading applied to the discs 42. Each arm assembly comprises pairs of arm 37 and 38. Each arm 38 carries a depth control roller 41 whose vertical position may be varied, and a pair of inclined soil cutting discs 42. A rod 52 pivotally connected to each arm assembly 36 passes through a member 54 and is surrounded by compression springs 55 and 56 whose loading is controlled by an abutment member 57. If a depth control roller 41 or cutting disc 42 encounters an obstruction, the corresponding arm assembly 36 will lift due to the yield of spring 55. A rod 24 engages members 11 and 13 at trunnion blocks 26 and 20, and is surrounded by compression springs 29 and 30, and rotation of handle 32 alters the effective length of the rod between trunnion blocks 20 and 26, thus ensuring that there is adequate weight on the discs 42 to provide adequate soil penetration, whilst maintaining adequate weight on ground compacting rollers 44. Seed is delivered through a tube (90), Fig. 4 (not shown), located adjacent to each disc 42 from a box 70 whose delivery is controlled by a seed metering device driven by the action of the spider wheel 74.

GLOVER & CO., Ltd., G. Feb. 3, 1948, Nos. 3093 and 6281. [Class 27] [Also in Group XXIX] A prepayment gas meter has a pair of outlets, one e of which is controlled by the auto-valve j, whilst the other f is in permanent communication with the metering mechanism. This second outlet f is for connection to refrigerators or similar apparatus which require an uninterrupted but small supply, and delivery through it is restricted by a small opening k. The quantity mechanism comprises a screw and nut m, n arranged to traverse a slide p in opposite directions during prepayment and consumption. The mechanism is shown in credit, a pin q on the slide holding a spring-loaded lever r connected to the valve j in a position to hold the valve open. When credit is exhausted, the pin q passes a step in the lever r allowing it to rock under the action of its spring s to close the valve. The pin q then moves slowly across the right-hand half of the lever r, as gas is delivered through the outlet f. When a further prepayment is made the pin q must be returned beyond the step in the lever r before the valve j is opened to restore the main supply through the outlet e. In this way payment is secured for all gas delivered through the outlet f. In the modified mechanism of Fig. 2, (not shown), the nut n is connected to the valve j by way of a slidable rod, a compression spring between the nut and rod yielding during restricted consumption through the outlet f after the valve has closed.",GEORGE GLOVER & CO LTD,MOORE JOHN ALEXANDER;;BOARDMAN FRANK,,https://lens.org/016-824-861-406-639,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,G07F15/001,G07F15/00,G1R RAB           RAB;;G4V VAA           VAA1;;G4V V111          VAA1,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In order to achieve this, first a transfer characteristic corresponding to the collective contribution to the overall gain versus frequency characteristic of the filter desired of the two transducers, is derived in terms of the z-transform and the roots or the reciprocals of the roots of the resulting polynomial in z ' are found. These roots or reciprocals are then divided into two groups in such manner that at least one pair of non-identical roots or reciprocals which have equal ratios between their real and imaginary parts and the product of the moduli of which is equal to unity are included one in each group. Two further polynomials are then found which have as their roots or the reciprocals of their roots those of the first group and those of the second group respectively, and the two transducers are constructed with successive active electrode pairs the electrodes constituting which have relative weights proportional to the coefficients of the successively increasing powers of the variable in one further polynomial and the variable in the other further polynomial respectively.

May 17. Loom shuttles, changing bobbins in, automatically; shuttles; bobbins, pirns, etc.; breast beams; lays; weft forks.-Relates to means for automatically supplying bobbins to shuttles when the weft is practically exhausted, or broken. The bobbins in the magazine shown in Fig. 1, are held between retainers or spring plates e, e<4>, Fig. 4, respectively secured to the endless carriers E, E', which travel upon sprocket-wheels D, D<1>. Each plate e<4> is formed with a bent extension e<6> for holding the thread end. The spindle of the wheels D' is driven intermittently by a pawl and ratchet mechanism actuated by means of an electromagnet G. The bobbin in use is held in a self-threading shuttle H, by spring plates h having transverse grooves which engage with circumferential ribs i<1> on the bobbin. The metallic head I of the bobbin is in electrical connection with a contact-plate h<3>, secured to the shuttle, and this plate h<3> contacts, at the end of every pick, with one or other of two pairs of contactsprings j, j<1> and j<2>, j<3>, secured to the iron raceway of the lay B. The spring j<2> is electrically connected to a battery K, or other source of electricity, and the spring j<3> is connected to an insulated contact-spring L on the breast beam M. The spring L makes contact, at certain times, with a contact-piece L' carried by a shaft N ; the piece L' is electrically connected with the magnet G, which in turn is connected with the battery K. A second electric circuit includes the battery K, magnet G, and two pairs of contact-springs 0, O<1> and P, P'; the circuit is closed through the springs O, O<1> and P, P', respectively, by means of the bobbin retainers e, and a boss Q, secured to a shaft Q<1>. When the shuttle enters the shuttle box C', Fig. 4, the weft thread, if the bobbin is not nearly exhausted, holds up a feeler R, attached to the loom frame ; but if the bobbin is nearly exhausted, the feeler springs into contact with the metallic head of the bobbin, and electrical connection with the battery K is established through the spring j<1>. The feeler is electrically connected to an electromagnet R', which is connected to the battery K, and secured to the weft-slide fork r. The weft-fork hammer S, Fig. 5, forms part of a pivoted lever S<1>, which is oscillated by means of a cam T on the shaft Q'. An arm r<4> of a bell-crank lever r<2>, pivoted to the slide r, forms the armature of the magnet R', and the other arm r<5> engages with the end of the hammer S when the magnet R<1> is excited. An eye r<6>, on the slide r, engages with an arm n secured to the shaft N. When the weft is nearly exhausted, the electric circuit including the magnet R' is closed when the shuttle enters the box C', and the magnet R<1> attracts its armature and causes the arm r<5> to swing across the path of the hammer S, which next actuates the slide r and arm n, causing contact to be made between the pieces L, L'. By these means, the circuit including the magnet G is partially closed, and, when the shuttle enters the shuttle box C, the spring h<3> completes the circuit across the springs j<2>, j<3>, and the magnet G is caused to actuate the bobbin magazine, so that a full bobbin is brought into the position indicated at 2, Fig. 1. The lay then beats-up, and forces the shuttle into engagement with the full bobbin, while the empty bobbin is ejected. The empty bobbin retainers are then moved into the position 3 by the action of the magnet G, which is again excited by a current in a circuit closed by means of the springs O, O<1> and P, P<1>. When the weft thread breaks, the weft fork falls across the path of the hammer S, and the circuit including the magnet G is partly completed by contact between the pieces L, L', and this circuit is completed when the shuttle reaches the box C. The ensuing action is the same as that described as taking place.when the weft is nearly exhausted. Cases containing bobbins may be placed in the magazine, and may be transferred to the shuttle in the same way as when bobbins alone are employed.",MOORE WILLIAM ENOCH;;CLARK FRANK RALPH,MOORE WILLIAM ENOCH;;CLARK FRANK RALPH,,https://lens.org/169-441-390-872-050,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

In order to achieve this, first a transfer characteristic corresponding to the collective contribution to the overall gain versus frequency characteristic of the filter desired of the two transducers, is derived in terms of the z-transform and the roots or the reciprocals of the roots of the resulting polynomial in z ' are found. These roots or reciprocals are then divided into two groups in such manner that at least one pair of non-identical roots or reciprocals which have equal ratios between their real and imaginary parts and the product of the moduli of which is equal to unity are included one in each group. Two further polynomials are then found which have as their roots or the reciprocals of their roots those of the first group and those of the second group respectively, and the two transducers are constructed with successive active electrode pairs the electrodes constituting which have relative weights proportional to the coefficients of the successively increasing powers of the variable in one further polynomial and the variable in the other further polynomial respectively.

Soldering.-Relates to a machine for soldering the tops and bottoms on cans, the machine being of the class in which the cans are rolled in a continuous succession along a trough of molten solder in which their lower edges are immersed. Fig. 1 shows in elevation the ends of the machine, Fig 3, a cross-section of the solder trough with a can rolling therethrough, and Fig. 10 a perspective view of the turnover guide at the leaving-end of the machine. The cans rolling from the crimper at 20<b> are engaged successively by fingers 45 of the chain 12 which runs the whole length of the machine above and below it. The groove 4<c> is provided along which the chain may run. In order that the lower edges of the cans may roll in the trough at the required angle, the bar 6 is carried in a support 7 which is adjustable vertically and at right-angles to the machine by eccentrics and levers. The edges of the cans are first rolled through an acid bath, drops being allowed to drain away. By means of a screw arrangement, the level of the fluxing-groove may be maintained, the flux being supplied by an inverted vessel. The cans are then taken by the fingers of the chain to the soldering-trough 2 arranged above a furnace. On leaving the trough, the cans enter the turnover guide-way 54, drop their surplus solder, and disengage themselves from the fingers with their bottom ends on the conveyer-band 55 by which they are removed from the machine. The piece 4 extends the whole length of the trough and is supported and aligned at intermediate points by set-screws. To allow the lower edge of the plate to expand freely, the angled portion of it is divided into sections. The standards 15, which at each end of the machine sustain the operating mechanism, support adjustable sleeves upon which the pulleys for operating the chain are supported, the chain passing round the pulleys as indicated in dotted lines. As regards the chain-fingers each has two ridges so that a finger rubs a can at two points only. The entering roll-way of the machine is formed with raised side-walls to prevent a can from being thrown out if it overrides a finger. The back portion 54<a>, Fig. 10, which slopes downwardly, is of wood. The bearings of the spindle of the driving-pulley are made adjustable.",LETSON JAMES MOORE KELLY;;BURPEE FRANK WATTS,LETSON JAMES MOORE KELLY;;BURPEE FRANK WATTS,,https://lens.org/076-504-249-659-975,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The system includes summing an input signal 101 with a dither signal 202 produced by dither generator 201. Processing means 100, e.g. an interpolator or decimator, processes the summed signal 203. The effects of dither are substantially removed from output 204 by equivalently processing the dither signal 202 alone using duplicate or equivalent processing means 200. The processed dither signal 206 is subtracted from output 204 using summer 208, thereby cancelling components of the processed signal that result from the presence of the dither signal. Randomizing the input signal by summing it with dither signal 202 ensures that the power consumption of the device is essentially constant regardless of fluctuations in input signal. Unwanted variations in operating temperature in an ASIC are avoided. Non-linear operation of units 100, 200 is avoided by two's complement arithmetic or by constraining the amplitude of the dither signal with scalers (311, 312).",AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES INC,MOORE GEORGE S;;SANDE FRANK VAN DE,,https://lens.org/001-055-268-507-334,Patent Application,no,8,0,4,4,0,H03H17/0219;;H03H17/0621;;H03M1/089;;H03H17/0621;;H03H17/0219,H03M1/08;;H03M1/06,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Clocks and watches. SMITH & SONS (ENGLAND) Ltd., S. Jan. 8, 1959 [Jan. 8, 1958], No. 817/58. Class 139. In an electric timepiece a coil 3, Fig. 1, carried by the balance staff 2, oscillates in the gap between a soft iron member 13 and the polepieces 11, 12 of a permanent magnet 10. The maintaining circuit, Fig. 2, includes a transformer 24, a transistor 21, a rectifier 23 and a voltage source 20, 22. As the coil swings through the magnetic field a voltage is induced in it to cause a current to flow in the primary winding of transformer 24. When the base of the transistor is driven negative, as the balance swings in one direction, a collector current flows through coil 3 in opposition to the induced voltage and a maintaining impulse is imparted to the balance. The induced secondary transformer voltage drops to zero when the transformer core reaches saturation and the transistor returns to its quiescent condition. The balance springs 5, 6 are connected to the coil 3 by wires 16, 17, respectively. The circuit is such as to tend to keep the amplitude of balance oscillation constant. The coil may be of rectangular form, Fig. 3 (not shown), and supported from the periphery of the balance to co-operate with a short bar magnet secured between the limbs of a V-shaped soft iron member.

A substrate is treated so that it can both provide locations for electrooptical components and be etched so as to generate grooves in which optical fibers can be mounted. During the etching of the grooves any electrooptical component already mounted on the substrate is protected from damage by the etchant by a protective coating. A feature is that optical fibers can be mounted with their cores above the surface of the wafer.

    A semiconductor process is disclosed which forms openings in a dielectric layer through which the emitter region and collector region of lateral bipolar junction transistors are formed. In one embodiment of the invention, the emitter openings for the lateral bipolar junction transistors are first protected by a photoresist layer that is patterned to expose the collector openings for the transistors. A first implant is performed through the exposed windows in the dielectric layer and into the exposed substrate or epitaxial layer therebelow, and then diffused to a suitable depth. The patterned photoresist is then removed to additionally expose the emitter openings, and a second implant is performed, this time into both the collector and the emitter regions, and then diffused to a suitable depth that is shallower than the first implant (used in the collector). Since the two implants are aligned to openings through the dielectric layer defined typically by a single mask, excellent base-width control and repeatability is achieved for the lateral transistors. Through careful selection of the collector and emitter diffusion profiles (i.e., depth and concentration), a more optimal PNP transistor may be constructed that has a collector deeper than its emitter. This scheme provides far greater collection efficiency than a traditional lateral PNP transistor made of the same diffusion for both the emitter and the collector. Greater collection efficiency provides improved Beta, better gain matching, and less parasitic loss of injected holes to a surrounding P-type junction isolation.

    A semiconductor process is disclosed which forms openings in a dielectric layer through which the base region of both high-voltage and high-gain bipolar transistors are formed. In one embodiment of the invention, the openings for the high-gain transistors are first protected by a photoresist layer that is patterned to expose the openings for the high-voltage transistors. A first base implant is performed through the exposed windows in the dielectric layer and into the exposed substrate or epitaxial layer therebelow, and then diffused to a suitable depth. The patterned photoresist is then removed to additionally expose the openings for the high-gain devices, and a second base implant is performed, this time into both base regions, and then diffused to a suitable depth. Emitter regions are then formed within the base regions of both transistor types by traditional implantation and contact techniques. Since the two base implants for each high-voltage transistor are self-aligned to a single opening through the dielectric layer, excellent control and repeatability is achieved for the high-voltage transistors. Moreover, since the second base implant is common to both types of transistors, many of the characteristics of the two types of transistors are well matched to each other.

Automatic voltage control systems. PLESSEY CO. Ltd. June 16, 1959 [June 24, 1958], No. 20169/58. Class 38 (4). In an automatic direct-voltage control system, a field of a dynamo in series with a supply is controlled differentially by the output voltage and a stabilized reference voltage. In an embodiment, a generator armature 1, in series with an output terminal 3, is driven by a motor 4 connected across a supply 2. A field 18 of the generator is fed from the supply via a resistor 19a. The output of an alternator 5 driven by the motor 4 feeds a full-wave rectifier 7 through the main windings 21, 22 of a saturable reactor 25. The rectified alternator output through a control winding 16 of the saturable reactor 25, is fed to a voltage regulator tube 26 shunted by Zener diodes 9 in series with a resistor 8. The flux of a second control winding 20, energized from the stabilized voltage, is opposed by the flux from the control winding 16 so as to tend to maintain constant the output voltage of the rectifier 7. A full-wave rectifier 14 is fed from the alternator 5 via windings 12, 13 of a magnetic amplifier 6 and energizes a field 17 of the generator via a feedback control winding 10, the flux of which is additive to that of a bias-winding 15 energized from the stabilized output and adjusted by a variable resistor 23. The flux due to the bias and feedback windings is opposed by the flux of a control winding 11, energized by the difference between the output voltage and the voltage across Zener diodes 9, so as to vary the current in the field 17 of the generator to maintain the output voltage constant. In a modification, the bias-winding 15 is left out and the resistor 8 is directly connected to the rectifier 7 and the generator voltage adjusted by variation of the valve of the resistor 19a.",PLESSEY CO LTD,MOORE RAYMOND LEONARD;;NEWELL FRANK PETER;;DAWSON DONALD EDWARD,,https://lens.org/161-427-800-463-179,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G05F1/33,G05F1/33,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

SOLUTION: If a dispatch unit serving as a 1st stage stops its operation and cannot dispatch the instructions, a 1st execution unit serving as a 2nd stage receives no Job in a step 801. Then the processing proceeds to a step 803 to decide whether the 1st execution unit can produce its result. Therefore, the 1st execution unit carries out a division operation that requires plural cycles and can produce its result as soon as the division operation is over.

    In a data processing system of the type having multiple processor units coupled to one another by a bus means for interprocessor communications there is provided a fiber optic interconnection system to interconnect the bus means of multiple processor sections to one another, thereby allowing groups of the processor units to be physically spaced from one another. The fiber optic interconnect system includes, for each multiprocessor unit section functions to receive messages communicated on the interprocessor bus of that section for receipt by a destination processor of the other section, format the message for fiber optic transmission, and transmit the message; and circuitry for receiving messages on the fiber optic link, scheduling the message for transmission to the destination processor, and maintaining that scheduling in the face of receipt of another message for the same processor unit. The fiber optic interconnect system includes means for configuring the system to identify which processor units are in which section and, when more than two sections are interconnected by the fiber optic link, provide information as to the shortest route to the destination processor from a section.

Proximity effects adverse to the device characteristics are minimized. On the intermediate circuit structure (1, 2, 3) a lift-off resist stencil (5) is patterned with windows exposing areas that are critical with respect to proximity effects. After deposition of a contact metal layer (6) in the exposed areas a back-etch resist stencil (7) is patterned over selected positions of the contact metal to protect the underlying contact regions of the integrated circuit structure. The contact metal not covered by the back-etch stencil is then etched, leaving the desired contact configuration.

In a method of machining such as turning, milling and planing in which a slice-like cutter bit 12 secured to a holder 11 is fed into a workpiece transversely to the cutting direction, the bit has a cutting edge formed at the juncture of its face with its side wall and is orientated in relation to the workpiece so that its face is the clearance face 15 and the side wall 14 forms the rake face, the angle of obliquity of the cutting edge to the cutting direction being the maximum which achieves effective cutting. The angle of obliquity is defined as the angle between a tangent to the cutting edge and the direction of cutting. In addition to the orientation of the cutting bit as set out above, the bit may also be inclined to the axis of the holder. The bit is secured to the holder by means of a screw and a split sleeve (see Specification 1,140,843) and may be invertable and indexable so as to present a new cutting edge to a workpiece when required. The various forms of cutter bit (see Specifications 1,140,842 and 1,140,844) may be circular or polygonal and the cutting edges may be formed by a plurality of successive arcuate portions.

A floor conveyer, e.g. for use in shoe factories, comprises a plurality of wheeled carriages adapted to carry shoes, and a conveyer for conveying the carriages through a number of work areas, each carriage comprising an engaging device adapted to be engaged by the conveyer, and a forwardly extending bumper linked to the engaging device and adapted to move it out of engagement with the conveyer when the bumper encounters an obstruction, and wherein the conveyer comprises, in one work area, a pool position and a number of operating positions, with, e.g., an identical shoe machine at each position, the conveyer also comprising, in another work area, e.g. a single different shoe machine, the conveyer being provided with a stop device at the pool position movement of which from a first condition to a second condition releases the leading carriage of the pool from the stop device, which carriage is then conveyed towards the operating positions; a stop device at each operating position, which device is movable between a first condition in which it stops a carriage being conveyed by the conveyer and a second condition in which it allows carriages to pass: a release device at each operating position, which, when a carriage arrested by the associated stop device is removed from operable relationship to the conveyer causes the stop device to return from its first to its second condition; and a signal device associated with each operating position which on operation causes the stop device at the pool position to move from its first to its second condition releasing a carriage from the pool, which is then conveyed to the operating position with which the signal device is associated, the signal device also causing the stop device at its associated operating position to move to its first condition in which it arrests the carriage being conveyed, which carriage is readily removable from operable relationship to the conveyer by an operator. The conveyer comprises a horizontal rectangular channel 4, Fig. 2, extending through the work areas one side of the channel being provided by a rail 3 which guides the carriages when they are being conveyed. An endless chain 14 is located in the channel, which chain comprises fixed upstanding members to engage with the conveying device of a carriage. The stop device at the pool position, Fig. 7.- The stop device at the pool position comprises a first stop member 20 and a second stop member 22 both extending along and close to the channel 4 of the conveyer. With the stop device in its first condition the first member 20 is in an upper position in which it extends obliquely upwards providing an inclined surface 20P, and the second member 22 is in a lower position in which it extends horizontally. With the device in its second condition the member 20 extends horizontally and the member 22 extends obliquely upwards. With the stop device in its first condition, the leading carriage of the pool is held stationary by the first member 20, the engaging device of the carriage being held in an upper position out of engagement with the chain 14. When the stop device moves to its second condition the engaging device of the leading carriage is able to move into engagement with the chain 14 and the carriage is conveyed thereby. Subsequent carriages are retained by the second member 22 until the device is returned to its first condition when the carriages are all moved forwardly until the leading carriage is arrested by the first member 20. The remainder of the pool of carriages are held one behind the other with their engaging devices being held clear of the chain 14, by collision of their front bumpers with the next preceding carriage. The end portions of the stop members 20, 22 comprise abutments 24S, 50S, respectively, which positively prevent the engaging device of a carriage from moving past the stop members. The members 20, 22 are pivoted at 25, 48, respectively, and are actuated by solenoids 38, 62. The solenoids when energized move pivoted members 30, 56, respectively, which act on cam surfaces 42, 66 on the members 20, 22 against the action of springs 44, 64. The springs normally hold the stop device in its first condition and then when the solenoids 38, 62 are energized the device is moved to its second condition. The stop device and release device at each operating position, Fig. 9.-These stop devices each comprise a stop member 96 extending along and close to the channel of the conveyer and movable between a lower second condition in which it extends horizontally, Fig. 9, and an upper first condition in which it extends obliquely upwards providing an inclined surface. When the stop device is in its first condition a carriage reaching the device is arrested, its engaging device being moved upwardly out of engagement with the chain 14, by engagement with the inclined surface. The end portion of the member 96 comprises an abutment 98S which arrests the carriage and prevents the engaging device of the carriage from moving past the stop member. The release device comprises an elongated catch member 122 pivotally mounted at 123 on the stop member 96 and adapted to operate two microswitches 134, 136. When the stop member 96 is in its lower condition an upper surface of the member 122 extends above the member 96 and the microswitches are not operated. When the stop member is in its upper position, the upper surface of the member 122 still extends above the member 96 and the microswitches 134, 136 are not operated until the engaging device of a carriage is held by the abutment 98S. This depresses the member 122 and causes it to operate the microswitches 134, 136, and this operation causes the stop device at the pool position to return from its second to its first condition. On removal of the carriage held by the stop member 96 from operable relationship to the conveyer the elongated member 122 is released and this causes the stop member 96 to return to its lower condition. The member 96 is pivoted at 100 and is operated by a solenoid 116. When the solenoid is energized it moves a pivoted member 110 against the action of a spring 118 to raise the member 96, the member 110 engaging with a cam surface 117 on the member 96. The microswitches 134, 136 are operated by set-screws 130, 132, respectively, arranged so as to operate the microswitch 136 slightly before the switch 134. The stop member at the other work area referred to, is a fixed member extending obliquely upwards providing an inclined surface, and provided with an abutment at its upper end (Fig. 11a, not shown). Its action is similar to that of the stop members at each operating position. The carriages 2, Figs. 1, 2.-Each carriage comprises a frame 78, and a base 83 fitted with four casters 77. Each carriage is provided with an engaging device 18, comprising an L-shaped member 84 pivoted to the base 83. A hollow cylinder 94 is fixed to the forward end of the member 84. A rod 88 is rotatably mounted in the cylinder 94 and to the forward end of this rod is fixed a cross-shaped member 92 with four arms 107 which abuts against the forward end of the cylinder 94. A ratchet member 90 is mounted slidably on the rod 88 and is held by a spring 97 in contact with the notched rear end of the cylinder 94. The spring 97 also acts as a shock-absorber for the member 18. The member 92 is rotatable clockwise only between four positions in which two of its arms 107 are vertical. A bracket 121 depending from the base 83 serves to steady the member 84. When a carriage is moved into operable relationship to the conveyer, the carriage is pushed by use of fixed handles 74 so that the lowermost arm 107 engages the rail 3, whereupon the member 92 is rotated through 90 degrees. This brings another of the arms 107 into engagement with the chain 14, and one of the horizontal arms 107 is in a position to engage with the stop devices of the conveyer. A pivoted latch member 105 on an arm 103, Fig. 2, is also provided and under the action of a spring 111 this engages the rail 3 and steadies the carriage 2 whilst it is being conveyed. Each carriage is provided with a front bumper 79, comprising upper and lower plates 75, 85, respectively. The lower end of the plate 85 is hinged on a rod 89 to the frame of the carriage and a horizontal hinge 87 is provided between the plates 75, 85. The upper end of the plate 75 carries a rod 91 which is mounted for up and down sliding movement in slots 95 in the frame. A rod 82 links the engaging device 18 with the rod 91 and when the bumper 79 engages an obstruction, e.g. the rear bumper 76 of the preceding carriage, the rod 91 is moved upwardly and this moves the device 18 out of engagement with the chain 14. Twelve shoe holders 200 are secured to the frame of the machine. Alternative engaging device, Fig. 6.-This device comprises a member 222 fitted to a rod 88<SP>1</SP> fitted in place of the rod 88 of Fig. 2, which rod 88<SP>1</SP> is not rotatable. The member 222 has a cam surface 226 which will ride over the rail 3<SP>1</SP> as the carriage is moved into operable relationship to the conveyer. When the member 222 is raised by a stop device it is still not clear of the rail 3<SP>1</SP> and thus the carriage cannot drift away from the conveyer. A handle (not shown) is provided to lift the member 222 clear of the rail 3<SP>1</SP> when it is desired to move the carriage away from the conveyer. Means for steadying the carriages during movement, Fig. 16.-Two robust abutment members 404, 406 fitted with rollers 414, 416, respectively, are secured to the base of a trolley so that they are disposed on the other side of the rail 3 from the engaging device 319 which is held from side to side movement by depending brack",BRITISH UNITED SHOE MACHINERY,GOODRICH SIDNEY GORDON;;LOVETT ALBERT EDWARD;;MOORE REGINALD THOMAS;;SMITH FRANK RICHARD;;BASSFORD JOHN MURRAY;;ROBBINS JOSEPH,,https://lens.org/068-418-235-516-083,Granted Patent,no,0,2,2,2,0,A43D111/006;;B61B10/04;;B65G37/02,A43D111/00;;B61B10/04;;B65G37/02,B7L LAB           LAB;;B7L L37           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
