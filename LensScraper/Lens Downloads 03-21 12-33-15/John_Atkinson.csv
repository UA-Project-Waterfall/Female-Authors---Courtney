Such a crane may have a counterweight on the rear of the crane jib superstructure and mounted so that it can be moved inwardly and outwardly relative the superstructure to balance the load on the jib. When the crane is to be driven along the rod, however, the jib is folded over the platform of the vehicle and in addition the counterweight is desirably removed from the jib superstructure and carried in a position on the vehicle platform where its weight best suits the vehicle suspension. In order to remove the counterweight, the superstructure is slewed to bring the counterweight to a position adjacent an upwardly inclined surface carried by the platform of the vehicle, the bottom surface of the counterweight being inclined at a corresponding angle to the horizontal equal to that of the inclined surface. The counterweight is then moved to engage the underside of the counterweight with the inclined surface on the platform and cause the counterweight to ""ride up"" the inclined surface of the block. In this position, the load on the beams carrying the counterweight is removed so that the counterweight can be removed and tied to the vehicle platform for travel. In this way, the hydraulic rams or the like which control the balancing movements of the counterweight can be used in the disengagement and re-engagement of the counterweight and no extra hydraulic rams are needed.",COLES CRANES LTD,ATKINSON JOHN,GROVE COLES LIMITED (1986-12-23);;SELOC REALIZATIONS LIMITED (1985-05-15),https://lens.org/152-364-023-520-906,Granted Patent,yes,3,8,16,18,0,B66C23/74;;B66C23/74,B66C23/74,212/178,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Staples, J. A. Nov. 14. Float valves; lift valves; floats.-In water-supply tanks adapted to be used with service pipes, a special valve and valvecontrolling mechanism are employed. The tank A is made airtight and preferably of an elongated cylindrical shape. The water is supplied by a pipe B at the lower end. The outlet is normally closed by the float valve D, which is held down on its seating 7 by the pressure in the tank A. In the outlet pipe C is placed the plunger F, shown in Fig. 7, which consists of a ring 12 and a disc 11 connected by vertical ribs 13 and with a cup 14 with openings 15 in its lower part supported above it by webs 16. This plunger is actuated by a cam 20, Fig. 5, on a rocking shaft 21 worked by a handle 22. When the plunger is raised, the upper edge of the cup 14 lifts the float D, which, on the inflow of water, rises to the top of the tube E surrounding it. The air in the cup 14 rises to the top of the tank A, thus replenishing the amount. The water does not escape, being prevented by the disc 11 fitting into the collar 11<a>. The handle 22 being released, the plunger F sinks and allows the water to escape. The float D sinks slowly, as air can only enter the portion of the pipe E above it by the hole 10, until the water reaches the opening 38 and allows the air to pass through it, the float D being of such a shape that the air can pass it ; this allows any excess of air in the tank A to escape with the water. When the float D regains its seating, the flush is stopped and the tank A commences to refill. The distance through which the plunger F is moved, and therefore the size of the aperture through which the flush escapes, can be regulated by means of the nut 24, Fig. 5, against which the end 23 of the handle 22 strikes. The size and height of the opening 38 can be regulated by a sleeve sliding on the tube E. The pipe B opens into a covered way 26, Fig. 1, which is continued as an annular baffle 25, to prevent the rush of water from disturbing the float D.",STAPLES JOHN ATKINSON,STAPLES JOHN ATKINSON,,https://lens.org/040-281-524-811-635,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The transducer comprises a primary winding 20 movable relative to two secondary windings 22, 24 and a detector responsive to the difference between the magnetic coupling of the primary winding to the respective secondary windings to provide an indication of the relative position of the primary winding. In order to achieve output linearity, one secondary winding 24 overlies the other 22 and the number of turns in each winding per unit length tapers along the length of the winding, the direction of taper in one winding being the opposite of the direction of taper in the other. Provision of a primary winding which is movable relative to the two secondary windings is said to simplify construction. Current is driven through the transformer primary winding by a Colpitts oscillator. A pair of capacitors (52, 54 Fig. 2) in series with the primary winding form a series resonant circuit across the power supply. The oscillator frequency is 2 kHz. <IMAGE>",FORD MOTOR CO,ATKINSON JOHN KARL,,https://lens.org/117-403-567-528-05X,Patent Application,no,1,3,3,3,0,G01D5/2291;;G01D5/22;;G01P3/52;;H01F21/04,G01D5/22;;G01P3/52;;H01F21/04,G1N NAEC          AEC;;G1N N1A3A         AEC;;G1N N1D7          AEC;;G1N N1D7A         AEC;;G1N N7H1          AEC;;G1N N7N           AEC;;H1T T1C           TTV;;H1T T1C           T1J;;H1T T7A5          TTV;;H1T T7A5          T1J;;H1T T7C1A         TTV;;H1T T7C1A         T1J;;H1T T7C4          TTV;;H1T T7C4          T1J;;H1T T7C5          TTV;;H1T T7C5          T1J;;U1S S1847;;U1S S2011,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Wheel - guards and obstruction - removers. - A car fender is lowered when a trip is collapsed by contact with an obstacle. The removal of the obstacle causes the trip to expand and the guard to resume its normal position by gravity. The fender 11 is counterbalanced by a weight 15, and is pivoted to bell-crank levers 7 supported by an adjustable frame 3 and hangers 6. A trip bar 32 is connected to the hangers 6 by a collapsible lazy-tongs frame comprising links 28, 23, 18, with braces 33, 36, The braces 36 are pivoted at 38 to the counterweight 15. The links 18 are pivoted at 16 to the hangers 6, and have slotted ears 39 through which pass studs 41 on the levers 7. Cams 43 fixed to the links 18 bear under and limit the downward movement of fingers 42 fixed to the counterweight 15. When the trip frame collapses, through contact with an obstacle, the links 18 force back the levers 7 up to the stops 44 and raise the back of the fender through the braces 36, which are moved forwards and upwards, thus lowering the front.

J., and Atkinson, J. May 10. Gas and explosive-vapour engines.-Fig. 1 shows a two-stroke engine in which the air is compressed into a reservoir pipe D. The valves G, F admit gas, vapour, or a spray of oil or spirit, and air respectively into the pipe D and the valve E puts the pipe D in communication with the cylinder. A short spiral passage is formed in the cylinder cover to prevent the old and new charges from mixing and to produce an intimate mixture of the gas and air on leaving the passage. The exhaust valve opens a little before the end of the out-stroke, and the passage leading to it is closed by the piston on its in-stroke. The volume compressed is thus less than the cylinder volume. During the in-stroke, air and gas are admitted into the pipe D, and the position of the valves is such that pure air remains near the outer end. During the out-stroke, this air enters the cylinder first, to effect a partial scavenging, and is followed by mixed air and gas. Part of it is then expelled during the early part of the instroke, and waste of explosive vapour is thereby avoided. The capacity of the pipe D is of importance in producing the effects described. An enclosed crank chamber may be used along with the pipe D, or a separate pump may be employed. The method of working may also be applied to a double-acting engine.",CROSSLEY WILLIAM JOHN;;ATKINSON JAMES,CROSSLEY WILLIAM JOHN;;ATKINSON JAMES,,https://lens.org/195-637-838-816-928,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

In flock coating-apparatus, flock-laden air is circulated in a working chamber whilst a sub-atmospheric pressure is maintained therein to prevent the escape of flock dust. The lower part of a working chamber 10, containing a support 18 for articles W to be coated, is connected by a suction duct 12, containing a valve 31, to a recovery chamber 11. The upper part of chamber 10 is connected to chamber 11 by an inlet duct comprising sections 13, 13a, 13b. A valve 14 connects sections 13a, 13b, section 13a has a branch 15 closable by a valve 16, and a fan 17 connects sections 13, 13a. Section 13 is connected by an extensible pipe 34 to a travelling head 32 having a discharge slot 33 directed towards the work. The inlet and exhaust ducts are interconnected by a bypass duct 29 closable by a valve 30. Flock is introduced into chamber 11 via a door 23 and is supported on a screen 20 positioned above an inlet duct 21 closable by a valve 21d. An exhaust fan 24 is positioned in the upper part of chamber 11 above a set of filter elements 26. In use, adhesive-coated articles W are introduced into chamber 10 via a door 19, valves 14, 21a, 31 are opened, valves 16, 30 are closed, and fans 17, 24 are operated. Pressure in chamber 10 is thereby rendered sub-atmospheric, and flock, fluidised in chamber 11, is discharged from slot 33. On completion of coating, valve 14 is closed and valves 16, 30 are opened, whereby fresh air is blown over the articles W to remove surplus flock therefrom. Valve 31 is closed during cleaning of the filter elements 26. Bypass duct 29 may be omitted, and head 32 and extension pipe 34 may also be omitted when a screen is positioned in chamber 10 below the outlet end of section 13. The apparatus may be modified for continuous coating of work that passes on the upper run of an endless conveyor either under or through firstly a coating chamber and then a cleaning chamber in which fresh air is blown either on or through the conveyor.",J B THORNE & SON LTD;;ATKINSON THOMAS NORMAN,ATKINSON THOMAS NORMAN;;THORNE JOHN,,https://lens.org/178-358-018-115-28X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B05C19/001,B05C19/00,B2L LA            LA10;;B2L LCDA          LCDA;;B2L LCK           LCK;;B2L L108          LA10;;B2L L26G          -;;B2L L26H2A1       L26H;;B2L L26H2B1       L26H;;B2L L26H2C2       L26H;;B2L L26H2C5       L26H;;B2L L26H2D        L26H;;B2L L26H2F        L26H;;B2L L301          LA10,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

[Also in Group XXXIX] In apparatus for automatically resetting to a first saturation state a magnetic core of material with appreciable remanence and a substantially rectangular hysteresis characteristic, consequent upon switching the core to a second saturation state, input pulses for switching the core from the first to the second state are applied to a first winding on the core, and charge a capacitor, in series with the first or a second winding, whose unidirectional discharge through the first or a third winding produces a voltage time integral across this winding sufficient to switch the core back to the first state. The magnetic core gating circuit shown in Fig. 1 translates a digit-representing differentially timed pulse, obtained, e.g. from a record card, into a number of pulses corresponding to the digit value, which pulses may operate a counter as described in Specification 767,005. During each of the "" 9 "" to "" 0 "" times of a card-reading cycle, Fig. 2, camcontrolled contacts CB<SP>1</SP>, CB<SP>3</SP>, CB2 are closed in turn. When a card hole is sensed, (represented in Fig. 1 by closure of switch 14) a circuit is completed through contacts CB<SP>1</SP> and R17a which energizes a start winding 2 on a core 7 having a substantially rectangular hysteresis characteristic, so as to switch the core from a "" P "" saturation condition to the opposite "" Q "" condition. Upon the next closure of contacts CB<SP>2</SP> a pulse is. applied to winding 3 which switches the core back to P, thus inducing current in storage winding 4 in a sense to charge a capacitor 12 through rectifier 11. During the following card index point, the capacitor is discharged through a circuit comprising rectifier 16, contacts CB<SP>3</SP> and reset winding 5, thus resetting the core to condition Q and inducing an output pulse in winding 6 in a sense permitted by rectifier 13. The process is repeated for each successive closure of contacts CB<SP>2</SP>, CB<SP>3</SP>, thus providing a number of output pulses corresponding to the time of closure of switch 14. At the end of the cycle, the capacitor is discharged through a circuit comprising contacts CB<SP>5</SP> and R17b. If relay contacts R17a, R 17 are switched over, contacts CB4 apply a start pulse to winding 2 at the beginning of the cycle and the sensing of a card hole produces the "" stop "" pulse, in place of CB<SP>5</SP>, so that a number of output pulses representing the complementary value is obtained. Unwanted output pulses, such as might be caused by a pulse in winding 2, are eliminated by a circuit breaker in the output circuit. In a simplified core circuit (Fig. 4, not shown), a single winding receives both capacitorcharging input pulses and pulses due to the subsequent discharge of the capacitor. Fig. 5 shows a counting circuit comprising a magnetic core 36 arranged to pass from one saturation condition to the other in ten steps in response to pulses applied to winding 35. These pulses may be obtained from a gating circuit as described above or from a transformer as described in Specification 767,005, as shown, pulses from transformer 32 are applied to 35 through resistor 39, contacts 37 and rectifier 38. The voltage across resistor 39 charges capacitor 40 through rectifier 41. Contacts 44 are closed immediately after 37 open, and connect the capacitor through rectifier 42 and reset winding 43 to the junction of resistors 45, 46 which so biases the rectifier that its cathode is normally more positive than the voltage to which the capacitor is charged. When, however, core 36 is driven to saturation, the impedance of winding 35 drops and capacitor 40 is charged sufficiently to provide subsequently a discharge current through 43 which switches back the core to its first saturation state. An equivalent circuit for that of Fig. 5 is discussed, and it is stated that windings 35, 43 should have the same number of turns. In a modified counting circuit, the bias voltage for rectifier 42 is obtained from an additional winding on transformer 32. Reference is made to the use of thermionic valves or thyratrons as switches.",BRITISH TABULATING MACH CO LTD,DREWE JOHN;;ATKINSON PETER DOUGHTON,,https://lens.org/174-430-561-671-761,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,H03K3/45;;H03K23/76;;H03K25/00;;H03K23/76;;H03K3/45;;H03K25/00,H03K3/45;;H03K23/76;;H03K25/00,G4A A1CU          M;;G4A A1C1A         M;;G4A A10B          M;;G4A A2C           M;;G4A A5B           M;;G4A A8G           M;;G4D DCX           CX;;H3B B200          BE;;H3B B230          BE;;H3B B231          BE;;H3B B235          BE;;H3B B270          BE;;H3B B271          BE;;H3B B275          BE;;H3B B300          BE;;H3B B314          BE;;H3B B350          BE;;H3B B352          BE;;H3B B374          BE;;H3B B375          BE;;H3B B390          BE;;H3B B391          BE;;H3B B393          BE;;H3B B460          BE;;H3B B477          BE;;H3B B486          BE;;H3B B492          BE;;H3B B523          BE,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

IMPERIAL CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES Ltd. 1 July, 1968 [15 Aug., 1967], No. 37407/67. Heading D1P. [Also in Divisions C2 and C5] A process for brightening polymeric materials in the form of textile materials comprises incorporating into the said polymeric material an oxadiazole compound of formula: wherein R represents a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon group having at least 3 fused rings which may optionally carry non-chromophoric substituents and which may be the same as or different from the group represented by R, a hydrogen atom, an alkyl, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, optionally substituted mono-or bicyclic aryl, alkenyl aryl, or an optionally substituted mono-or bicyclic heterocyclic group, and n is 1 or 2. The polymeric material may be impregnated e.g. by padding with an aqueous suspension of the novel compound and then heated for a short time at a temperature between 150-200‹C. The incorporation may be carried out in the presence of other brightening agents, e.g. substituted 4: 4'-ditriazinyl amino stilbene-2:2'disulphonic acids, surface-active agents e.g. fatty alcohol-ethylene oxide condensates or sulphonated alkylnaphthalenes, or disperse dyestuff Dispersing agents may be present. The novel compound may be incorporated into the polymeric material when the latter is in the molten or plasticised form. In one example a 2-(pyren-1-yl)-5-(diphen-4-yl)-1, 3, 4- oxadiazole is dissolved in ethylene glycol, the solution is tumbled with polyester chip and the mixture is dried, melted, spun into filament and drawn into fibre. In other examples polyester fibre and polyacrylonitrile fabric are brightened by an aqueous dispersion of 2- phenyl-5-pyren-1'-yl-1, 3, 4-oxadiazole and 2- furen-2'-yl-5-pyren-1""-yl-1, 3, 4 oxadiazole respectively.",ICI LTD,ATKINSON JOHN REGINALD;;HEMINGWAY ERIC,,https://lens.org/199-915-030-391-974,Granted Patent,no,0,1,5,6,0,C07D271/10;;C07D271/10;;C07C2603/26;;C07C2603/26;;C07C2603/50;;C07C2603/50;;C07D271/107;;C07D271/107,C07D271/10;;C07D271/107,C2C CME;;C2C CWK;;C2C CZB;;C2C CZD;;C2C CZL;;C2C C1226;;C2C C1226;;C2C C1228;;C2C C1228;;C2C C123X;;C2C C1233;;C2C C1233;;C2C C1254;;C2C C1254;;C2C C1254;;C2C C1254;;C2C C1254;;C2C C1432;;C2C C1432;;C2C C1432;;C2C C1432;;C2C C1470;;C2C C1470;;C2C C1473;;C2C C1473;;C2C C200;;C2C C200;;C2C C213;;C2C C215;;C2C C215;;C2C C215;;C2C C215;;C2C C215;;C2C C22X;;C2C C22X;;C2C C22X;;C2C C22X;;C2C C22X;;C2C C22Y;;C2C C22Y;;C2C C22Y;;C2C C22Y;;C2C C22Y;;C2C C220;;C2C C220;;C2C C220;;C2C C220;;C2C C222;;C2C C222;;C2C C222;;C2C C226;;C2C C226;;C2C C226;;C2C C226;;C2C C246;;C2C C246;;C2C C246;;C2C C246;;C2C C25Y;;C2C C25Y;;C2C C25Y;;C2C C25Y;;C2C C25Y;;C2C C253;;C2C C253;;C2C C255;;C2C C255;;C2C C255;;C2C C255;;C2C C28X;;C2C C28X;;C2C C28X;;C2C C30Y;;C2C C30Y;;C2C C30Y;;C2C C30Y;;C2C C30Y;;C2C C305;;C2C C305;;C2C C305;;C2C C305;;C2C C31Y;;C2C C31Y;;C2C C31Y;;C2C C313;;C2C C313;;C2C C314;;C2C C314;;C2C C327;;C2C C337,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The hot gas enters at the top at a, and passes through the top section around two trays e, f. It then passes through a tubular connection d to the third section, and so on to the lowest but one, when it leaves the column. The cold air enters the lowest section, and, after passing around the distributing-trays e, f, it passes by a tubular connection d<1> to the next but one above, and so on to the second compartment, after which it leaves the column at c'. The washing-liquid enters the top compartment through a lute or by means of a spray, and overflows through inverted siphons g, h, i to each section in succession. During its passage downwards, the gas is washed and cooled, while the air in its passage upwards is heated and moistened.

J., and Atkinson, J. Dec. 7. Smoke and fumes, treating.-Gas, such as blast furnace or producer gas, is passed through cooling- towers and rotary apparatus, whereby it is cooled, and dust and other impurities are separated. The apparatus is shown in Figs. 1 and 3 in longitudinal and cross-sectional elevations respectively. The gas enters at b and passes down a tube c which dips an inch or two under water. The gas escapes upwards by an outer annular tube d, dipping in water in a tank a, to a tube e leading to the first of a series of plain condensers g dipping into water within a tank f. Leaving the last condenser by the tube h, it is further purified in a centrifugal apparatus i, preferably constructed as described in Specification No. 17,993, A.D. 1900, [Abridgment Class Centrifugal drying &c.]. A pipe then conducts the gas to a rotary fau k, from which it is led away by the tube l. Some of the dust is thrown down in the tubes c, d, and collects at the bottom of the tower, from which it is removed through a water lute p. More dust collects in the tank f, and falls down the inclined bottom to a deep part m, from which it may be removed by a pump. One or more divisions n are placed so as to dip into the water. Suction pipes o are provided to each tank, so that pumps may carry the water on to the condensers g in the same tank. The water overflows from the colder tank f to the warmer tank a, and is pumped to the top of the tower d. More than two tanks may be used. A little water may be passed with the gas through the rotary machines i, k to assist in throwing down the impurities.",CROSSLEY WILLIAM JOHN;;ATKINSON JAMES,CROSSLEY WILLIAM JOHN;;ATKINSON JAMES,,https://lens.org/107-941-977-990-031,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The gas valve is closed by a spring, and , opened by a rod acting through another spring only when air is admitted to a dash-pot on its stem by means of a small valve under the control of the governor. The Provisional Specification states that the invention is to some extent a modification of that described in Specification No. 13,500, A.D. 1903. Fig. 4 shows the gas valve R surrounding the stem of the admission valve 0 and carrying a piston U working in a cylinder, to which the valve.K controls the admission of air. A collar Z on the valve 0 tends to open the valve R through the spring X and to close it by acting through the cushioning- spring W and piston U. In a modification, the gas valve is independent of the admission valve ; it is opened by an adjustable tappet acting through a spring. The valve K may be a beat valve which is pressed open by a spring and is drawn on to its seat by the vacuum when it is nearly closed by the governor, to prevent a wasteful non-combustible charge being admitted. The gas enters late when it is throttled and always provides a rich mixture near the igniter.",CROSSLEY WILLIAM JOHN;;ATKINSON JAMES,CROSSLEY WILLIAM JOHN;;ATKINSON JAMES,,https://lens.org/180-259-234-981-295,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The resulting output control signal is used to determine by means of an appropriate algorithm which of the gates should be operated and to what extent to maintain the water level and to provide a corresponding demand signal. The demand signal is fed to a gate control circuit associated with the appropriate gate(s). The gate control circuit includes a motor for opening or closing the gate in response to a demand signal and a feedback loop incorporating a positional transducer. A river/canal system over a wide area can thus be controlled from a single location by controlling several gates simultaneously.,THAMES WATER AUTHORITY,ATKINSON PETER;;WALKER JOHN;;PETERS NORMAN,,https://lens.org/107-465-214-492-929,Patent Application,no,1,8,4,4,0,G05D9/12,G05D9/12,G3R RA23          BB;;G3R RA273         BB;;G3R RA28          BB;;G3R RA33          BB;;G3R RA34          BB;;G3R RA36          BB;;G3R RA382         BB;;G3R RA42          BB;;G3R RA523         BB;;G3R RA626         BB;;G3R RBB           BB;;U1S S1753,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The protection mechanism includes a valve actuating plate and an elastic member biasing the valve actuating plate upwards. The actuator is pushed upwards by a rising level of lubricant as the lubricant reservoir is filled. When the reservoir is full, the actuator causes the valve actuating plate to contact a valve stem. The valve actuating plate pushes the valve stem up to shut off a flow of lubricant to the reservoir through the shut off valve. During an overfill event the actuator shifts upward due to the rising level of the lubricant in the reservoir.

Switching between cooling (as shown) and heating modes is implemented using two-way valves (16, 24) such that the same components may be used, and in all embodiments described the conditioned air is supplied from a dry, closed loop. The system may operate in reverse flow i.e. the working air enters the turbine first. Moisture removal devices (28') may be incorporated to avoid heat exchanger icing and also control humidity, in addition, de-icing systems are included in the reverse flow embodiments because of their greater susceptibility to heat exchanger icing due to lower cycle temperatures. The temperature at which air is delivered to the load can be controlled either by diverting controlled amounts of hot or cold air, as appropriate, to be mixed with the conditioned air, or by varying the speed of the drive motor. <IMAGE>",AISIN SEIKI,ATKINSON MICHAEL JOHN;;BIRCH PETER HUGH,,https://lens.org/151-532-397-100-707,Patent Application,no,0,17,3,11,0,B60H1/321;;B60H2001/3248;;B60H2001/3255;;B60H2001/3297;;F25B9/004;;F24F5/0085,B60H1/32;;F24F5/00;;F25B9/00,F4H HG3E          HG3;;F4H HG3F          HG3;;F4H HG3H          HG3;;F4H HG3N          HG3;;F4V VGAA          GAA;;F4V VG243         GAA;;F4V VG244         GAA;;F4V V302          GAA;;F4V V305          GAA;;F4V V319          GAA;;G3R RA24          BQ46;;G3R RA25          BQ46;;G3R RA623         BQ46;;G3R RA626         BQ46;;G3R RBQ46         BQ46;;G3R RB4724        BQ46;;G3R RB475         BQ46;;G3R RB528         BQ46,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Valves and valve testing. GAS COUNCIL. 7 Feb., 1968 [14 Nov., 1966], No. 50860/66. Heading F2V. [Also in Division F4] A method of testing whether two fuel valves 12 and 13 series connected in a fuel line 10 to a burner are effectively closed comprises subjecting the enclosure 15 between the valves to suction and confirming that the resulting pressure in the enclosure 15 is consistent with the values being closed. The method may be applied in three ways: firstly, the enclosure 15 is evacuated and a check made (by means of a pressure switch P) that a predetermined pressure is reached in a predetermined time; secondly, the pressure in enclosure 15 is reduced to a predetermined value and the enclosure 15 shut off from the suction source and the pressure checked that it does not rise above the value in a predetermined time; thirdly, the first and second ways are combined sequentially. The two valves may be combined in a single valve for example as an Figs. 8 and 10. In Fig. 10 a disc 40 can be moved in a chamber 41 towards and away from a port 42 open to an inlet passage 43. When closed the disc 40 seats on concentric O-rings 45, 46 between which there is a space 47 connected to the valve test means by a passage 48. In Fig. 10 a slide 64 is slidable between a slipper 65 and two concentric seals 66, 67, seated to a valve casing 60 as by O-rings 68, to interconnect inlet and outlet passages 62, 63 by way of a passage 69 in the slide 64 (shown open in Fig. 10). A passage 72 connects the annular space 71 between the seals to the valve testing means A third valve type (Fig. 9, not shown) comprises a spherical plug (50) rotatable in a spherical body (51) such that in one position a passage (52) in the plug (50) interconnects inlet and outlet passages (53, 54). Passages (57, 58) interconnect the passage (52) and the valve testing means.",GAS COUNCIL,ATKINSON PETER GEORGE;;MOPPETT DAVID JOHN,,https://lens.org/088-345-230-189-256,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,F23N5/245;;G01M3/2876,F23N5/24;;G01M3/28,F2V VD11A         -;;F2V VD11B         -;;F2V VHX           -;;F2V VM1CX         -;;F2V VM1E          -;;F2V VM1P          -;;F2V VW61          VW61;;F4T THE           THE;;F4T THE1          HE1;;F4T TS2B          THE;;F4T TS2E          THE;;F4T TS2J2         -;;F4T TS4A2         -;;F4T TS4A4         -;;F4T TS5A          -;;F4T TS6B          -;;F4T TS6C          -;;F4T TS6E2         THE;;F4T TS6E3         THE;;F4T TS6E7         THE;;F4T TS7D          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Moisture removal devices (34, 34') may be incorporated to avoid heat exchanger icing and also control humidity. In addition, de-icing systems arc included in the reverse flow embodiments because of their greater susceptibility to heat exchanger icing due to lower cycle temperatures. The temperature at which air is delivered to the load may be controlled by diverting amounts of hot or cold air, as appropriate, to be mixed with the conditioning air. A high speed motor may be included for use as an alternative to the exhaust gas drive under conditions of low exhaust gas energy. <IMAGE>",AISIN SEIKI,ATKINSON MICHAEL JOHN;;BIRCH PETER HUGH,,https://lens.org/123-845-136-313-984,Patent Application,no,0,12,3,11,0,B60H1/321;;B60H1/00007;;B60H1/32;;B60H2001/3248;;B60H2001/3255;;B60H2001/3297;;F24F5/0085;;F25B9/004,B60H1/00;;B60H1/32;;F24F5/00;;F25B9/00,F4H HG3E          HG3;;F4H HG3F          HG3;;F4H HG3H          HG3;;F4H HG3N          HG3;;F4V VGAA          GAA;;F4V VG243         GAA;;F4V VG244         GAA;;F4V V302          GAA;;F4V V305          GAA;;F4V V319          GAA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In both sites, reducing negative and/or increasing positive charge augmented interaction with iC3/C3b and C4b, supporting a role of ionic forces in the binding reaction. With the initial characterization of the third CCP of an active site led to identification of three peptides necessary for binding. In line with earlier findings for the first two CCPs, interactions with iC3/C3b are similar but not identical to those with C4b, implying overlapping but distinct binding domains.

A supply spool 1 carries electrophotographic recording material in web form, and rollers 2 advance the recording material towards the drum 4, after which guillotine 3 cuts an individual sheet of predetermined length from the advancing web. The individual sheet is directed by rollers 2 onto the support member and clamped thereon. A corona charging unit 12 electrically charges the recording material on the support member, an imaging station 11, 25 projects a light image of the original document onto the recording material, a development station 7 applies an insulating toner to an electrostatic latent image on the recording material and a master fixing unit 14 fixes the developed toner image onto the sheet of recording material supported on the drum 4. In duplicating cycles means 16, 17 feeds copy sheets serially towards the support member, a transfer station is located so that copy sheets pass between an electrically charged transfer member 9 and the recording material on the drum 4 so that an unfixed toner image transfers onto a copy sheet. The copy sheets pass to a copy sheet fixing device 5 and the recording material travels past a cleaning unit 20 before it is re-charged at corona unit 12 and flood exposed at a station 20 in the next duplicating cycle, control means responsive to a start button and a counter records the number of duplicated copies required and controls the operation of all the aforesaid devices so that (I) in a master preparation cycle a sheet of recording material is cut from the material on the supply spool 1 and clamped onto the drum 4 after which a fixed toner image is formed on the master by driving the drum 4 at a first speed, electrically charging the recording material, forming a latent image of the original document thereon, developing 7 the latent image with toner and radiant heat fusing the developed toner image onto the recording material, (11) in subsequent duplicating cycles the drum 4 is driven at a second speed higher than the first speed and cyclically the drum is cleaned (20), electrically charged (12), uniformly illuminated (15) and redeveloped with toner (7) and the resulting toner image is transferred onto copy sheets and fixed thereon, and (III) on completion of duplication the used sheet of recording material is ejected from the support member.",RONEO ALCATEL LIMITED,"SHREEVE, NICHOLAS GILBERT;;TYLER, RICHARD GRAHAM;;ATKINSON, DAVID IAN HEATON;;ATKINSON, CYRIL JOHN",,https://lens.org/090-894-813-252-943,Search Report,yes,7,0,4,4,0,G03G15/228,G03G15/05;;G03G15/22;;G03G21/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

FERRANTI Ltd. 11 Nov., 1968 [12 Dec., 1967],No. 56524/67. Heading H3P. [Also in Divisions G1 and G4] Transformer winding T is tested by a surge voltage applied by an impulse generator, shown schematically as 10, triggered by tripping unit 11. Microphone M senses the sound produced by the breakdown of spark-gap S of the tripping unit, after a time delay determined by the distance between the microphone and the spark gap. Pulse generator P now triggers chopping gap CG which connects resistor R across the output of the impulse generator which then modifies the wavetail according to the particular terminating conditions. W 1 , W 2 are wave shaping circuits which shape the applied surge voltage. The time delay controlling this operation is varied by moving the microphone M. In Fig. 2 (not shown), a suggested circuit for pulse generator P comprises 2 thyratrons and a step-up pulse transformer.",FERRANTI LTD,HOLLIS CHARLES WELLINGTON;;ATKINSON LEONARD;;DUCKETT ALAN JOHN,,https://lens.org/091-471-985-092-722,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,G01R31/3272;;G01R31/62;;H03K3/37,G01R31/327;;H03K3/37,G1U UC1X          UC1X;;G1U U12A1C        PB;;G1U U12B3         PB;;G1U U12C6         PB;;G1U U12C8         PB;;G4F F14           -;;H3P PR            PR(V);;H3P P1R           -;;H3P P1T           -;;H3P P1U           -;;H3P P2C1          -;;H3P P2C4          -;;H3P P2D           -;;H3P P2G           -;;H3P P2T           -;;H3P P3K           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The reaction medium is preferably neutralised to pH 6-8 before isolating the product which may be effected by adding an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt to precipitate the corresponding sulphonate. Heating the products with acid liberates sulphur dioxide while with aqueous alkalis or alkali/hypochlorite mixtures, all or part of the sulphonate is replaced by hydroxyl. The halogenated starting materials may contain organic substituents attached to triazine ring carbon through nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur. Such compounds may be p obtained by treating a halogenated triaziane with an amine, alcohol, phenol or mercaptan. Starting materials prepared in Examples are: (10) the sodium salt of (4, 6-dichloro-s-triazinylamino)-benzene-3-sulphonic acid; from metanilic acid and cyanuric chloride; in (19) this is converted with sodium hydrogen sulphide to the disodium salt of (4, 6-dimercapto-s-trazinylamino)-benzene-3-sulphonic acid, which is further reacted with sodium hydroxide/sodium hypochlorite mixture to give the trisodium salt of (4-sulpho-6-hydroxy-s-triazinylamino)- benzene-3-sulphonic acid; in (18) the reaction product of cyanauric chloride and sodium sulphite is reacted with sodium metanilate to give (4, 6-disulpho-s-triazinylamino)-benzene-3-sulphonic acid trisodium salt. Specification 707,557 is referred to.ALSO:The invention comprises dyestuffs containing at least one s-triazine nucleus to at least one carbon atom of which is attached a sulphonic acid group in the form of its alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal (including magnesium) salt. They may be prepared by reacting the corresponding halogen compounds with a metal salt of sulphurous acid, preferably in aqueous solution. All or part of the halogen may be replaced. It is also possible to replace one halogen atom by sulphonate and a second by hydroxyl and to convert the sulphonate group to a hydroxyl group. The reaction medium is preferably neutralized to pH 6-8 before isolating the product, which may be effected by adding an alkali or alkaline-earth metal salt to precipitate the corresponding sulphonate. Heating the products with acid liberates SO2, while with aqueous alkalis or alkali/hypochlorite mixtures, all or part of the sulphonate is replaced by hydroxyl. The halogenated starting materials may contain organic substituents attached to triazine ring carbon through nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur. Such compounds may be obtained by treating a halogenated triazine with an amine, alcohol, phenol or mercaptan. The products may contain anthraquinone, azo, nitro, naphthalene and phthalocyanine residues, examples being provided. The preparation of some of the starting materials is also described. In examples, the dyes are applied by padding or printing to cotton, viscose rayon, nylon and silk. An acid-binding agent is preferably used before, with or after the dye. The dyed fabric may be steamed. Compounds of the invention containing two or more sulphonate groups attached to the triazine ring may be used to attach to cellulose products chemically related thereto, such as starch. In Example 46 cotton limbric is impregnated with a starch solution, dried and treated with an aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution of trisodium (4, 6-disulpho-s-triazinylamino)-benzene-3-sulphonate, dried and baked to give a stiffened fabric resistant to boiling soap treatment. In Example 47, the starch, bicarbonate and sulphonate are applied together to the cotton. In Example 50 a cotton cloth is impregnated with a sodium bicarbonate solution of trisodium (4, 6-disulpho-s-triazinylamino)-benzene-3-sulphonate, baked, washed and dried to give a fabric resistant to soiling. The products may be used to treat textiles dyed or printed with dyes containing amino- or mono-substituted amino groups to increase fastness to washing. In Example 45 silk, wool or polyacrylonitrile fabric dyed with tetramino anthraquinone is padded with an aqueous solution containing trisodium (4, 6-disulpho -striazinylamino) -benzene -3- sulphonate, dried and acid-steamed; viscose rayon and cotton dyed with a direct dye are treated similarly. In Example 49 a viscose rayon fabric is impregnated with a sodium carbonate solution of trisodium (4, 6-disulpho -striazinylamino)-benzene -3- sulphonate, dried, printed with a thickened paste comprising the dyestuff composition of Example 2 of Specification 707,557, lactic acid and di(2, 21-hydroxyethyl) sulphide, steamed, acetic acid rinsed, water rinsed, boiled in aqueous soap solution and dried.",ICI LTD,ATKINSON JOHN REGINALD;;HALL FRANK;;STEPHEN WILLIAM ELLIOT,,https://lens.org/104-270-756-386-048,Granted Patent,no,0,3,4,13,0,C09B43/02;;C09B62/04;;D06P3/663,C09B43/02;;C09B62/04;;D06P3/66,C2C CQG;;C2C CRJ;;C2C C1652;;C2C C1652;;C2C C215;;C2C C215;;C2C C22Y;;C2C C220;;C2C C247;;C2C C25Y;;C2C C25Y;;C2C C250;;C2C C250;;C2C C252;;C2C C252;;C2C C29Y;;C2C C29Y;;C2C C292;;C2C C292;;C2C C30Y;;C2C C30Y;;C2C C31Y;;C2C C313;;C2C C32Y;;C2C C322;;C2C C337;;C2C C37Y;;C2C C371;;C2C C39Y;;C2C C39Y;;C2C C394;;C2C C394;;C2C C42Y;;C2C C427;;C2C C560;;C2C C60X;;C2C C600;;C2C C600;;C2C C605;;C2C C605;;C2C C614;;C2C C620;;C2C C660;;C2C C670;;C2C C79Y;;C2C C798;;C3P PD1T18        PD1T;;C3P PD1T26        PD1T;;C3P PD1T27        PD1T;;C3P PD1T29        PD1T;;C3P PD1T31        PD1T;;C3P PD1T34        PD1T;;C3P PD1T37        PD1T;;C3P PD1T65        PD1T;;C3P PD1T67        PD1T;;C3P PD1T69        PD1T;;C3P PD1T70        PD1T;;C3P PD1T74        PD1T;;C3P PD1T76        PD1T;;C4P PD1T18        PD1T;;C4P PD1T26        PD1T;;C4P PD1T27        PD1T;;C4P PD1T29        PD1T;;C4P PD1T31        PD1T;;C4P PD1T34        PD1T;;C4P PD1T37        PD1T;;C4P PD1T65        PD1T;;C4P PD1T67        PD1T;;C4P PD1T69        PD1T;;C4P PD1T70        PD1T;;C4P PD1T74        PD1T;;C4P PD1T76        PD1T,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The universal water meter connector assembly includes a hexagonal hollow body that terminates in an externally threaded head at one end. The hexagonal body is provided with an internally threaded medial portion an end adjacent the head and an internally threaded end portion at the other end of the hexagonal body. The thread size of the medial portion is smaller than the thread size of the end portion to accommodate different sized water meter couplers. A internal stop is formed in the body below the head and above the medial portion for limiting movement of a supply line inserted into the body. The free end of the head is formed with an internally tapered portion that is configured to receive a cone-shaped member having a narrow end and a wide end with a beveled rim. The narrow end of the cone-shaped member is sized and shaped to mate with the internally tapered portion of the head. A gripper ring with depending fingers is positioned on the beveled rim. An open ended connector nut with an internal flange at an upper end has an internally threaded portion that is sized to be threaded onto the externally threaded head. The gripper ring and cone-shaped members are positioned within the connector nut, the narrow end of the cone-shaped member positioned in the internally tapered portion of the head. The internal flange of the connector nut engages the gripper ring and urges the depending fingers into contact with a supply line inserted in the connector assembly when the connector nut is turned onto the externally threaded head.",ATKINSON MANUEL DIAZ;;ABRAHAM MARK;;HALL JOHN DARREN;;WILLDING JOHN A,ATKINSON MANUEL DIAZ;;ABRAHAM MARK;;HALL JOHN DARREN;;WILLDING JOHN A,,https://lens.org/091-520-202-760-244,Granted Patent,yes,7,10,1,1,0,F16L19/061;;F16L19/083;;F16L19/083;;F16L19/061,F16L33/00,285/249;;285/332.1;;285/323,0,0,,,,INACTIVE
