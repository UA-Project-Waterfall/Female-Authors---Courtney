A reactor is coupled to a feed stock injector and receives a flow stream of hot combustion prods. Quench fluid is sprayed into the flow stream from the reactor to reduce the temp. sufficiently to terminate cracking reactions. A heat exchanger is coupled to the quenching plant and a knock out pot is coupled to the heat exchanger to spray coolant into the flow stream and condense out hydrocarbons. Appts. also produces other olefin prods. as well as chemical grade synthesis gas. The combustor is water cooled and includes gas filming to avoid coking in the combustor. Similarly, the reactor may utilise gas filming to avoid coking.
