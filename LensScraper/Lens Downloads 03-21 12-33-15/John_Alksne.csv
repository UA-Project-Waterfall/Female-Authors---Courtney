Each of these syringes is driven by a motor which compresses the plunger of the syringe causing it to inject its contents. The motors receive an activation signal from a computer controller which initiates the injection sequence upon receipt of a trigger signal which is provided either by a separate seizure detection computer, by activation by the patient who recognizes an aura indicative of an imminent seizure, or by activation by medical personnel observing the patient. The computer implements a delay cycle to permit verification of the trigger to avoid initiating the injection sequence in the event of false alarms. Since the radionuclide is placed in the syringe in advance of the actual injection, decay of the radioactive element is compensated for by storing more radionuclide in the syringe than is needed, then calculating the quantity of radionuclide to be injected based upon the time delay from the filling of the syringe to the occurrence of the seizure and the half life of the radionuclide.",UNIV CALIFORNIA,CORNACCHIA LOUIS;;ALKSNE JOHN K;;OZAKI GEORGE;;YEUNG DAVID W,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THE (1993-09-14),https://lens.org/125-599-039-084-894,Granted Patent,yes,4,187,1,1,0,A61M5/007;;A61M5/1407;;A61M5/1452;;A61M5/16827;;A61M2205/50;;A61M5/1407;;A61M5/16827;;A61M2205/50;;A61M5/007;;A61M5/1452,A61M5/00;;A61M5/145,600/4;;128/655,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
