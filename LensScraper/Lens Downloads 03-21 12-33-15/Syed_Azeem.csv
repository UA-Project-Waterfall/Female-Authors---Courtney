Das Verfahren ist wirksam, um zunächst einen schlechten Zustand für ein Schmiersystem zu bestimmen, um dann einen Ölabbau- oder Schmierstoffsystemfehler zu bestimmen. Als Reaktion auf einen Fehler im Schmiersystem wird der Motorbetrieb geändert, um die negativen Auswirkungen des Fehlers im Schmierstoffsystem zu reduzieren, wie beispielsweise das Erhöhen der Mindestleerlaufdrehzahl als Reaktion auf einen reduzierten Öldruck.",GM GLOBAL TECH OPERATIONS LLC,SARWAR AZEEM;;MEHDI SYED B;;LU XIANGXING;;PRYOR BRYAN K;;PEER SHANSHAN L,,https://lens.org/156-236-586-102-993,Patent Application,no,0,0,5,5,0,B60W10/06;;B60W50/0205;;B60W2710/0638;;B60W2710/0644;;B60W2710/0666;;F01M1/20;;F02D2041/227;;F02D31/001;;F02D2250/26;;F02D41/0007;;F02D35/0007;;F02D41/22;;F02D2041/228;;F02D2041/227;;F01M1/20;;F02D31/001;;F02D41/0007;;F02D2250/26,F02D41/08,,0,0,,,,PENDING
