    A system with multimodality instrument for tissue identification includes a computer-controlled motor driven heuristic probe with a multisensory tip. For neurosurgical applications, the instrument is mounted on a stereotactic frame for the probe to penetrate the brain in a precisely controlled fashion. The resistance of the brain tissue being penetrated is continually monitored by a miniaturized strain gauge attached to the probe tip. Other modality sensors may be mounted near the probe tip to provide real-time tissue characterizations and the ability to detect the proximity of blood vessels, thus eliminating errors normally associated with registration of pre-operative scans, tissue swelling, elastic tissue deformation, human judgement, etc., and rendering surgical procedures safer, more accurate, and efficient. A neural network program adaptively learns the information on resistance and other characteristic features of normal brain tissue during the surgery and provides near real-time modeling. A fuzzy logic interface to the neural network program incorporates expert medical knowledge in the learning process. Identification of abnormal brain tissue is determined by the detection of change and comparison with previously learned models of abnormal brain tissues. The operation of the instrument is controlled through a user friendly graphical interface. Patient data is presented in a 3D stereographics display. Acoustic feedback of selected information may optionally be provided. Upon detection of the close proximity to blood vessels or abnormal brain tissue, the computer-controlled motor immediately stops probe penetration. The use of this system will make surgical procedures safer, more accurate, and more efficient. Other applications of this system include the detection, prognosis and treatment of breast cancer, prostate cancer, spinal diseases, and use in general exploratory surgery.

Jan. 28, 1963, No. 3379/63. Heading A4C. A citrus fruit juice extracting apparatus comprises in combination means for halving fruit, means for removing juice from halved fruit, means for separating the juice from the peel remaining after the juice has been removed from the halved fruit and means for separating the oil bearing flavedo portion of the peel from the albedo remainder thereof. Whole fruit is conveyed in cups (not shown) past a halving knife 14 and quartering knives 80 and then fed in nearly quartered halves by divider plates 16 and star wheels 16a to the delivery platforms 18 of a pair of juice extracting mechanisms 17 each comprising a fruit pick up unit 19 and a reamer unit 20. The pickup unit 19 comprises a rotary disc 24 carrying resilient cups 22 formed of two halves, viz. a fixed half 23 secured to the disc 24 and a movable half 25 hinged as at 26 to the fixed half 23, and rollers 32 associated with the hinge 26 co-operate with a fixed cam disc 33 and a cam rail 38 to open the cup halves 23, 25 in the region of platform 18 to pick up fruit halves. The reamer unit 20, which is connected for synchronous rotation with the disc 24 by a universal joint 21, comprises rotary reamers 55 carried in a rotary base plate 56 driven from a sleeve 42 having an axis rotation inclined to that of the disc 24. In operation of the juice extracting mechanism 17 the reamers 55 enter the fruit halves picked up by the cups 22 which subsequently open to release the peel of the de-juiced fruit, the juice passing for collecting via a pan 73 and a shoot 74 and the peel quarters being separated from the juice by a grid 90 in an opening 91 in the pan 73. Beneath the grid 90 is located a pivoted shoot 117 in a feed hopper 115 for for the peel oil recovery unit 116 which includes two pairs of rollers 120, 130 which are rotated as indicated in Fig. 6. The upper rollers 120 are provided with sets of spaced ribs 125 separated by circumferential grooves and peel quarters are randomly fed to the bite 123 to be impaled on one or other of the rolers 120 with the ribs 125 penetrating the relatively soft albedo layer. The impaled peel is then divided by adjustably mounted knives 190 as it is carried between the rib of adjacent rollers 120, 130, the oil bearing flavedo passing in the direction of arrows 225, 226 and the albedo being separated from the rollers 120 by combs 201 whose teeth 100 engage the circumferential grooves in the rollers 120 and passing in the direction of arrows 230, 231. Rotary paddles 211 mounted in the hopper 115 serve to prevent jamming of the bite. Specification 930,562 and U.S.A.

    A submersible electric motor driven pump includes a motor chamber and a pump chamber separated by a seal chamber. Inboard and outboard shaft seals immersed in an oil buffer fluid within the seal chamber restrict the flow of liquid from the seal chamber into the pump and motor chambers. An integral or externally mounted pre-pressurized buffer fluid reservoir maintains a positive fluid pressure in the seal chamber relative to the external pressure at working depth, and suitable buffer fluid level within the chamber, preventing the ingress of the pumped media through the outboard seal. A unique impeller design circulates fluid within the seal chamber in the region of the outboard shaft seal, allowing continuous run dry operation when used in conjunction with an integrally cooled motor design. A cartridge shaft sleeve subassembly permits with a bearing configured between the inboard and outboard seals, facilitates maintenance.

The path comprises a matrix of cold cathode Ne discharge lamps 102 in which the pattern is shifted from column to column. The lamps are energized for a time of up to 50% of the shift frequency period, the time being variable to adjust the brightness of the display, the brightness may fluctuate to attract attention. Each character is represented by six pulses forming bits of a binary code and this input is fed to a receiver 204 including a series to parallel converter which allows the bits to be read out to a buffer storage 206 comprising 6 shift registers each of 16 stages. The buffer control 210 determines the number of characters in the storage 206 which indicates the input rate and causes a variable frequency clock 216 to vary the buffer output therewith. The clock has a long linear response to smooth out rapid input changes. Data in the last stage of the storage passes to a decoder 220 comprising an array of negators 802, 804 and Nand gates 806 one for each character. A lamp encoder 224 comprises an array of Nand gates 820 arranged in 10 rows corresponding to the rows of the lamp matrix. Each Nand gate 806 is connected to a pattern of gates 820 representing its character. A signal from the buffer operates the appropriate Nand gate 806 and an encoding signal is applied to selected gates 820. The outputs of each row of gates 820 are connected to a NOR gate 1000- 1, 2... and the output from these gates applied to lamp operating circuits LOR-1, 2... Each LOR circuit comprises a lamp shift register LSR and drive transistors 1002 associated with each lamp 102. A readout encoder strobe pulse from a column shift and lamp strobe control circuit 226, controlled by the clock 216, is applied to line ECSI and passes through encoded gates 820a to encode the first stage of corresponding LSR's. A lamp strobe pulse is then applied to all lamps and selected lamps in the first column associated with encoded stages of the LSR's are lit. A read out pulse is then applied to line ECS2 and passes through encoded gates 820-b to encode first stages of registers LSR, the original signals in the first stages being shifted to the second stages by lamp shift pulses. Another lamp strobe pulse is applied and the corresponding lamps in two columns are lit. Encoder pulses are sequentially applied to the remaining lines ECS. Subsequently the data in the last stage of the buffer is cancelled and data from the preceding stages all moved forward. When the data input rate falls too low the lamps are strobed twice per signal shift to prevent flicker. When data input ceases characters remain lit but stationary.",STEWART WARNER CORP,ANDREWS RUSSELL WILLIAM;;KOLESAR PAUL MICHAEL;;PAYNE ROBERT ADDISON;;POSNER HOWARD GORDON,,https://lens.org/086-133-880-904-832,Granted Patent,no,0,0,6,9,0,G09G3/10;;G09G3/10;;G09G5/222;;G09G5/222;;G09G2310/0286;;G09G2310/0286;;H04L12/1804;;H04L12/1804,G09G3/28;;G09G3/29;;G09G5/42;;H04L12/18,G4H HDB           H;;G4H HDR           DR;;G4H HSB           SB;;G4H HSD           SD;;G4H HS5           H;;G4H H1A           G4H;;G4H H13D          G4H;;G4H H14B          G4H;;G4H H3C           G4H;;G4H H6A           G4H;;G4H H6B           G4H;;G4H H6D           G4H;;G4H H6E           G4H;;G4H H7B           G4H;;G4H H7G           G4H;;G4H H9E           G4H,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The disposable has a spray drying head and a plasma drying chamber. The head has a spray dry nozzle assembly in fluid communication with the plasma source and the pressurized aerosol gas source. The pressurized gas flows in a vortex pattern that atomizes plasma droplets in the chamber. The head also includes a plenum has uniform air pressure of the drying gas. A baffle plate forms the floor of the plenum having drying gas jets that supply drying gas to the chamber. The atomized plasma droplets evaporate in the presence of the drying gas emitted from the jets to obtain dried plasma particles and humid air. A capture filter captures the dried plasma particles and allows the humid air to pass. The humid air passes through the gas outlet and the exhaust port.,VELICO MEDICAL INC,ANDREWS ROBERT R;;SNYDER HERMAN E;;MERRITT WILLIAM J;;ORDWAY EVAN P;;STROHL CLAIR;;BARRON RUSSELL,VELICO MEDICAL INC (2022-09-20);;PARSEC SOLUTIONS LLC (2022-11-04),https://lens.org/009-493-342-133-379,Granted Patent,yes,288,0,3,3,0,A61K35/16;;F26B3/12;;F26B21/004;;F26B25/066;;F26B25/08;;F26B3/14;;F26B5/04;;F26B21/10;;F26B21/12;;F26B21/003;;F26B25/007;;F26B21/083;;A61K35/16;;F26B3/12,F26B3/12;;A61K35/16,,210,0,,,"Lea, et al. “The Reaction between Proteins and Reducing Sugars in the “Dry” State” Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge; Jun. 5, 1950; pp. 626-629.;;Carpenter, et al. “Rational Design of Stable Lyophilized Protein Formulations: Theory and Practice” Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers; 2002; pp. 109-133.;;Schmid “Spray drying of protein precipitates and Evaluation of the Nano Spray Dryer B-90” PhD Thesis; 2011; 125 pages.;;Shuja, et al. “Development and Testing of Low-Volume Hyperoncotic, Hyperosmotic Spray-Dried Plasma for the treatment of Trauma-Associated Coagulopathy” The Journal of Trauma; Mar. 2011; vol. 70; No. 3; pp. 664-671.;;Bakaltcheva; et al. “Freeze-dried whole plasma: Evaluating sucrose, trehalose, sorbitol, mannitol and glycine as stabilizers” Thrombosis Research; 2007; vol. 120; pp. 105-116.;;European Search Report, EP Application No. 14154366, dated Aug. 29, 2014.;;European Search Opinion, EP Application No. 14154366, dated Aug. 29, 2014.;;International Search Report and Written Opinion, PCT/US2010/049176, dated Nov. 4, 2010.;;International Search Report and Written Opinion, PCT/US2011/058358, dated Jul. 4, 2012.;;Answer, Affirmative Defenses, Counterclaims, Cross-Claims and Jury Demand, Entegrion, Inc. vs. Velico Medical, Inc., dated Dec. 3, 2012.;;Civil Action Cover Sheet; Entegrion, Inc. vs. Velico Medical, Inc., dated Oct. 19, 2012.;;Complaint including Exhibit A, B, and C; Entegrion, Inc. vs. Velico Medical, Inc., dated Oct. 19, 2012.;;Mini Spray Dryer B-290—Application Note; www.buchi.com; Mar. 30, 2008.;;Nano Spray Dryer B-90; www.buchi.com; Jul. 18, 2011.;;Mini Spray Dryer System Configuration; www.buchi.com; Jan. 8, 2007.;;Quick Operation Guide; Mini Spray Dryer B-290; www.buchi.com; Sep. 16, 2004.;;Process Parameters; www.buchi.com; Nov. 21, 2008.;;Training Papers Spray Drying; Version B; www.buchi.com; 19 pages; Oct. 29, 2002.;;Mini Spray Dryer B-290; www.buchi.com; May 10, 2007.;;Fischer M., et al., “Stability of African swine fever virus on spiked spray-dried porcine plasma,” Transboundary and Emerging Diseases, 68(5): 2806-2811 (2021).;;International Preliminary Report on Patentability, PCT/US2011/058358, dated Apr. 30, 2013.;;Edwards et al., The Preparation and Use of Dried Plasma for Transfusion; British Medical journal; vol. 1, No. 4131; Mar. 9, 1940; pp. 377-381.;;Blazquez, E., et al., “Biosafety steps in the manufacturing process of spray-dried plasma: a review with emphasis on the use of ultraviolet irradiation as a redundant biosafety procedure,” Porcine Health Management, 6(16): p. 78 refs.

The disposable has a spray drying head and a plasma drying chamber. The head has a spray dry nozzle assembly in fluid communication with the plasma source and the pressurized aerosol gas source. The pressurized gas flows in a vortex pattern that atomizes plasma droplets in the chamber. The head also includes a plenum has uniform air pressure of the drying gas. A baffle plate forms the floor of the plenum having drying gas jets that supply drying gas to the chamber. The atomized plasma droplets evaporate in the presence of the drying gas emitted from the jets to obtain dried plasma particles and humid air. A capture filter captures the dried plasma particles and allows the humid air to pass.
