The process comprises the following steps: (a) feeding an anolyte comprising at least one polyol to the anode compartment; (b) feeding a catholyte comprising CO 2 to the cathode compartment; (c) and applying a voltage difference between the cathode and the anode such that at the cathode CO 2 is reduced to formate and at the anode the at least one polyol is oxidized to formate.",AVANTIUM KNOWLEDGE CENTRE BV,VAN DEN BOSCH BART;;FIGUEIREDO MARTA CATARINA COSTA;;SCHOUTEN KLAAS JAN PIETER;;BRANDS MARIE;;RAWLS BRIAN JAMES;;PHILIPS MATTHEW FRANCIS,AVANTIUM KNOWLEDGE CENTRE B.V (2022-08-11),https://lens.org/115-232-709-283-259,Patent Application,yes,7,0,4,4,0,C25B3/23;;C25B3/07;;C25B3/26;;C25B9/19;;C25B11/031;;C25B11/032;;C25B11/052;;C25B11/061;;C25B11/075;;C25B11/065;;C25B11/091;;C25B15/029;;C25B3/07;;C25B11/032;;C25B3/26;;C25B9/19;;C25B11/075;;C25B3/23,C25B3/07;;C25B3/23;;C25B3/26;;C25B9/19;;C25B11/032;;C25B11/075,,1,1,010-021-332-778-106,31767871;;pmc6877572;;10.1038/s41467-019-13375-z,"Li et al., “Nickel-Molybdenum Nitride Nanoplate Electrocatalysts for Concurrent Electrolytic Hydrogen and Formate Productions,” Nature Communications (2019 Nov 25), Vol. 10, No. 1, pp. 1-12.
