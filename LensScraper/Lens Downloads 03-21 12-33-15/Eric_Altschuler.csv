The mu waves measured by a pair of electrodes placed over the motor cortex are signal processed to determine the power spectrum. At rest, the peak value of the power spectrum in the 8-13 Hz range is high, while when moving or thinking of moving, the peak value of the power spectrum in the 8-13 Hz range is low. This measured change in signal power spectrum is used to produce a control signal. The encephalolexianalyzer can be used to communicate either directly using Morse code, or via a cursor controlling a remote control; the encephalolexianalyzer can also be used to control other devices. The encephalolexianalyzer will be of great benefit to people with various handicaps and disabilities, and also has enormous commercial potential, as well as being an invaluable tool for studying the brain.",UNIV CALIFORNIA,ALTSCHULER ERIC L;;DOWLA FARID U,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THE (1992-12-18),https://lens.org/120-673-915-074-970,Granted Patent,yes,15,75,1,1,0,A61B5/7257;;G06F3/015;;A61B5/374;;A61B5/7257;;G06F3/015;;A61B5/374,G06F17/00,600/545;;600/544,6,3,052-258-887-446-630;;079-300-272-048-739;;063-389-451-234-783,4681814;;10.1109/tbme.1973.324256;;74329;;10.1016/0013-4694(78)90107-4;;10.1016/0013-4694(91)90040-b;;1707798,"Silverman et al, A Hybrid Broad Band EEG Frequency Analyzer . . .
