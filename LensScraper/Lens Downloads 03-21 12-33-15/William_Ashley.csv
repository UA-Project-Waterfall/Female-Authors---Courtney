Imaginary median surfaces 16 of the blade members 7 are continuously curved in the same sense away from the cutting plane 12, from the cutting edges 8 toward the rear edges. The handle 1 has a pair of fork arms 6, the distal ends of which are connected to the head at positions adjacent the respective ends of the head 2. Each fork arm 6 has a groove 49 allowing pivoting of the distal end about a pivot axis parallel to the head axis, the grooves 49 being mutually aligned on the same side of the forked end portion 4 of the handle 1. Each groove 49 is filled with a resiliently deformable material 54 which is deformed when a pivoting force is applied to the razor head 2 during shaving and which restores the razor head 2 to a normal position when the force is removed. The head 2 has undercut apertures 42 in rear abutment surfaces 43, and the distal ends of the fork arms 6 have detent elements 44 projecting forwardly from front abutment surfaces 46. The front and rear abutment surfaces 46,43 abutting against one another and the detent elements 44 engage in the undercut apertures 42 in such a manner that the head 2 is fixed relative to the distal ends of the fork arms 6, the distal ends being movable toward one another to disengage the detent elements 44 from the undercut apertures 42 and allow the head 2 to be removed from the handle 1.",KNOWLEDGE & MERCHANDISING INC,KING WILLIAM ASHLEY,,https://lens.org/084-062-384-366-715,Patent Application,no,27,12,34,34,0,B26B21/225;;B26B21/521;;B26B21/528;;Y10T83/0577;;Y10T83/0572;;Y10T83/8696;;Y10T83/8694;;Y10T83/061;;B26B21/225;;B26B21/52;;Y10T83/0577;;Y10T83/0572;;Y10T83/8696;;Y10T83/8694;;Y10T83/061;;B26B21/528;;B26B21/225;;B26B21/521,B26B21/22;;B26B21/40;;B26B21/52,B4B B34A          -;;B4B B34C          -;;B4B B34F          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In one embodiment the synthesizer is steered to a new frequency value by a DAC  10  which controls a VCO (  5  ) input voltage. Subsequently, the phase of the synthesizer output is locked to that of the reference frequency oscillator (  1  ) by resetting the feedback frequency divider (  6  ) at the point in time when a rising edge of the reference frequency is detected.

Starting and stopping gear. VICKERS-ARMSTRONGS, Ltd. Oct. 13, 1948, No. 26673. [Class 80(ii)] [Also in Groups XXVI and XXXVII] Starting and stopping gear for a press is controlled by a lever 6 on a pivot 4, the outer end of the lever being connected to a treadle while its inner end carries a spring-pressed pawl 8 coacting with the inner end of a lever 5 on the same pivot 4, the outer end of the lever 5 being connected to the starting and stopping means, e.g. a clutch or electric switch or throttle valve and a brake. A second pawl 13 is mounted on a fixed pivot pivot 14, and a hand-lever 17, pivoted at 18 and carrying a pin 19 adapted to be engaged in any one of three holes 20, 20a, 20b, pivotally carries one end of a link 22, the other end 23 of which is controlled by cam means driven by the press. With the pin 19 engaged in hole 20, as in Fig. 1, depression of the treadle causes the inner end of lever 5 to be raised, by means of pawl 8, to a position in which it is held by the pawl 13, irrespective of whether the treadle is released or not. The machine is thus started and runs until the link 22 moves so that a part 22b depresses an arm 13a of pawl 13 (and also, if'treadle has not been released, an arm 8a of pawl 8) so as to release the lever 5, which returns to initial position, stopping the machine. With the pin 19 engaged in hole 20a, Fig. 5, a part 17a of the lever 17 engages a part 13b of the pawl 13 so as to displace the latter and render it incapable of holding the lever 5. The machine is started by depression of the treadle but may now be stopped at any time by release of the treadle, the machine being in any case finally stopped by the action of the link 22 in tripping the pawl 8. With the handle in the third position, in which the pin 19 is engaged in the hole 20b, the pawl 15 is again held inoperative but the link 22 is also displaced laterally so that it cannot contact the pawl 8, so that the machine continues to run so long as the treadle is depressed.",VICKERS ARMSTRONGS LTD,ASHLEY ALLAN;;TIPPING WILLIAM JOHN,,https://lens.org/041-201-951-523-56X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G05G13/00;;G05G2700/32,G05G13/00,G3N NCA4          CA4;;G3N NGCA4A        GCA4A;;G3N N270          CA4;;G3N N270          GCA4A,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The bias current feeds a reference amplifier, the output of which is coupled to a lowpass filter to remove the pulse signal component. The output of the lowpass filter is a DC voltage level which is proportional to the average optical output of the ILD. The voltage level output of the lowpass filter is applied to a current sink coupled to the ILD. The bias current for the ILD is controlled to drive the differential to zero. Because the bias current control feedback loop is responsive to the optical output of the ILD, the bias current is automatically compensated for changes in temperature.

SOLUTION: A transparent or a translucent adhesive layer 4 is formed comparatively thick and to the same shape as the planar shape of a pictorial pattern layer 3 or slightly larger than the planar shape of the pictorial pattern layer 3 so that the adhesive layer 4 can be firmly fusion-bonded to an object 10 to which an image is transferred. Further, a fluorescent agent is slightly added to the resin paste of the adhesive layer 4 as a marking agent. The position of the adhesive layer 4 can be detected by emitting light such as ultraviolet rays or a visible ray with the addition of the fluorescent agent. Besides, the adhesive layer 4 is made to emit a light by a flashlamp 7 and the position of the adhesive layer 4 can be easily determined visually.

Self-generated AGC action results from the fact that the gain of an avalanche photodiode increases as the bias voltage applied across the diode increases. As the light intensity received by the diode increases, there is a corresponding increase in the current flow through the diode and the series-connected resistor. The consequential increase in IR drop across the resistor decreases the bias voltage across the diode, so that the gain of the diode is reduced. Through this action, the dynamic range of optical input of the photodiode will be increased for a fixed dynamic range of electrical output. Temperature compensation is achieved by coupling a temperature-sensitive voltage divider circuit between the bias voltage supply and the gain-controlling resistor. This voltage divider network may include a thermistor coupled in parallel with one resistor component of a resistor divider that is connected to a bias voltage source. The value of the parallel resistor is chosen to match the thermistor's characteristic to the voltage versus temperature characteristic of the APD so that a temperature-compensated bias voltage reference, to which the gain-controlling resistor is connected, is available over a wide temperature range (e.g. -40.degree. C. to +60.degree. C.). This temperature compensation allows the avalanche photodiode to be operated at a nearly constant available gain across this range and prevents the diode from being damaged by too high a bias voltage.",HARRIS CORP,CASPER PAUL W;;ASHLEY WILLIAM B,,https://lens.org/019-279-739-267-338,Granted Patent,yes,7,165,1,1,0,H04B10/6911;;H04B10/6911,H04B10/158,307/310;;307/311;;250/238;;328/2,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The transmitted signal component is extracted from the back facet of the ILD for feedback stability control purposes and is coupled to signal quality measuring circuitry from a wideband current-to-voltage converter that is coupled to the output of a fast photo diode that extracts the optical output signal from the rear facet of the ILD for the purposes of generating a feedback control voltage to be used for ILD bias control. The bias current generated through a feedback loop from the fast photo diode to the wideband current-to-voltage converter feeds reference amplifier, the output of which is coupled to a lowpass filter to remove the pulse signal component. The output of the low pass filter is a DC voltage level which is directly proportional to the average optical output of the ILD. The voltage level output of the lowpass filter is applied to a current sink coupled to the ILD. The bias current for the ILD is controlled to drive the differential to zero. Because the bias current control feedback loop is responsive to the optical output of the ILD, the bias current is automatically compensated for changes in temperature. The current-voltage converter output is further coupled to a buffer amplifier to supply an output voltage to downlink signal quality monitoring circuitry. In a repeatered, multichannel fiber optic communication system, this quality-indication signal availability facilitates a fault isolation scheme wherein the transmitter outputs are examined selectively.",HARRIS CORP,CASPER PAUL W;;ASHLEY WILLIAM B,,https://lens.org/168-783-603-165-231,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,H01S5/06832;;H04B10/504;;H04B10/58;;H04B10/0795;;H04B10/50575;;H04B10/508;;H04B10/564;;H04B10/504;;H04B10/58;;H01S5/06832;;H04B10/0795;;H04B10/508;;H04B10/50575;;H04B10/564,H01S5/0683;;H04B10/155,325-1,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The integrated circuit of the present invention comprises a first circuit installed in a first power domain and a distributed power controller for controlling the transition of the first power domain between a plurality of power states. The distributed power controller includes a power control circuit in at least a second power domain and an additional power control circuit in a third power domain. While a current power state of the first power domain is at least one of the power states, the second power domain allows the power control circuit to be in a power saving state of unlearning the current power state of the first power domain. However, the third power domain is prevented from entering the power saving state. Moreover, the additional power control circuit outputs a mode state signal used by the power control circuit to allow the power control circuit to be in an initial operation mode depending on the current power state of the first power domain when the second power domain is out of the power saving state. Accordingly, an unintended result occurring when being out of the power saving state is guaranteed not to be generated even when the power control circuit unlearns the current power state of the first power domain while being in the power saving state.",ADVANCED RISC MACH LTD,SEVERINO CHRISTOPHER VINCENT;;BROWN DOMINIC WILLIAM;;CRAWFORD ASHLEY JOHN,,https://lens.org/041-566-563-948-496,Patent Application,no,0,0,7,7,0,G06F1/3234;;G06F1/3275;;G06F1/3287;;G06F1/3287;;G06F1/24;;G06F1/3228;;G06F1/3287;;Y02D10/00;;Y02D30/50,G06F1/32;;G06F1/24,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The distributed power controller comprises at least power control circuitry in a second power domain and additional power control circuitry in a third power domain.

However, the third power domain is prevented from entering that power saving state. Further, the additional power control circuitry is arranged to output a mode status signal that is then used by the power control circuitry, when the second power domain exits the power saving state, to place the power control circuitry into an initial mode of operation that is dependent on the current power state of the first power domain.

The integrated circuit has first circuitry provided within a first power domain, and a distributed power controller for controlling transition of the first power domain between a plurality of power states. The distributed power controller comprises at least power control circuitry in a second power domain and additional power control circuitry in a third power domain. Whilst the current power state of the first power domain is in any one of at least two of the plurality of power states, the second power domain is allowed to be placed in a power saving state where the power control circuitry loses knowledge of the current power state of the first power domain. However, the third power domain is prevented from entering that power saving state. Further, the additional power control circuitry is arranged to output a mode status signal that is then used by the power control circuitry, when the second power domain exits the power saving state, to place the power control circuitry into an initial mode of operation that is dependent on the current power state of the first power domain. This ensures that, despite the power control circuitry losing knowledge of the current power state of the first power domain whilst it is in the power saving state, no unintended consequences occur when the second power domain subsequently exits the power saving state.",ADVANCED RISC MACH LTD,SEVERINO CHRISTOPHER VINCENT;;BROWN DOMINIC WILLIAM;;CRAWFORD ASHLEY JOHN,ARM LIMITED (2018-10-19),https://lens.org/111-580-586-734-077,Granted Patent,yes,5,2,7,7,0,G06F1/3234;;G06F1/3275;;G06F1/3287;;G06F1/3287;;G06F1/24;;G06F1/3228;;G06F1/3287;;Y02D10/00;;Y02D30/50,G06F1/32;;G06F1/3234,,1,0,,,"Search Report for GB1721192.1, dated Jun. 15, 2018, 4 pages.",ACTIVE

Each tire is constructed having the tire carcass slightly angled away from the conventional ninety degree configuration to minimize torque windup caused by interaction between the individual tires in the dual assembly. Such a deviation from ninety degrees is made relatively small enough to avoid experiencing a significant rolling resistance penalty in each tire yet large enough so that the torque windup effect of one tire on the other tire is minimized. A method of reducing torque windup in a dual tire assembly is achieved comprising the steps: configuring both tires in a dual assembly to provide a carcass angled slightly from 80 to 100 degrees; mounting such tires in proximal relationship in a dual tire assembly on a common axle; operating both tires in a free rolling mode of operation; and using the angled carcass of each tire to minimize the effect of torque windup imposed by the opposite tire.

The ring 21, which is preferably dished, consists of a radially-slotted core 30 which is made e.g. of steel and is encased in material 36 having inner and outer oppositely axially-extending annular ridges 34, 35 which are urged info engagement respectively with the faces 22, 28. The material 36 is made e.g. of a chemically inert oil resistant synthetic rubber or plastic. The core 30 may be circumferentially corrugated instead of being radially slotted. In a modification an inner deformable beading along the inner periphery of the ring extends axially inwardly to contact the surface 21 of the leg 3. The head 2 has an internal chamber 5 from which flushing fluid is conducted downwardly through a passageway 6 to the cutters 7. Radial loads on the cutter are taken by roller and ball bearings 8, 9, the latter also receiving loads axially of the shaft. A pilot pin 11 on the end of the shaft 4 fits within a bushing 12 pressed into the bore 13 of the cutter, a thrust button 14 carried by the cutter at its closed end assuming a portion of the outward thrust. The cutter is first mounted on the shaft with the bearings 8 in place, the balls then being introduced through a bore 15 until the ball bearing is complete whereupon a pin 16 is welded in the bore 15. Lubricant for the bearings is supplied from a chamber 17 in the head 2 the lower end of the chamber communicating with the bore 15 and cut-away portions of the pin 16, so that lubricant may run freely to the bearings.

    Magnetic separators are used for treating silicon-containing materials from chlorosilane reactors to remove magnetically influenced components in the silicon-containing materials. The removal of such impurities allows for enhanced reactivity of the silicon-containing materials in processes wherein the silicon-containing materials are raw materials for the production of silicon based compounds, such as, for example, basic alkylhalosilanes such as dimethyldichlorosilane, methyldichlorosilane, and other chlorosilanes such as trichlorosilane, which chlorosilanes are useful in the preparation of valuable silicon-containing products.

A component of the apparatus is capable of operating in one of at least two power modes and component power control circuitry which is communicatively coupled to the component causes the component to operate in a selected power mode of those power modes. A system power controller controls operation of the component power control circuitry by setting a power mode lock condition therein. When the power mode lock condition is met the component power control circuitry cannot change the selected power mode of the component. Power control over the component is thus partially delegated from the system power controller to the component power control circuitry.,ADVANCED RISC MACH LTD,BROWN DOMINIC WILLIAM;;CRAWFORD ASHLEY JOHN;;SEVERINO CHRISTOPHER VINCENT;;THOMAS TESSIL,ARM LIMITED (2016-05-05),https://lens.org/142-082-172-704-794,Granted Patent,yes,30,2,4,4,0,G06F1/3206;;G06F15/7807;;G06F15/82;;G06F1/3203;;G06F1/3206;;G06F1/3287;;G06F13/24;;Y02D10/00;;G06F1/3206;;G06F1/3203;;Y02D10/00;;G06F1/3287;;G06F13/24,G06F1/32;;G06F13/24,,2,0,,,"‘An Analysis of Efficient Multi-Core Global Power Management Policies: Maximizing Performance for a Given Power Budget’ by Canturk Isci et al., copyright 2006, IEEE.;;‘3.

The AMS is obtained by reacting (i) water, (ii) an acid-stable solvent for the water, (iii) a solid strong cationic hydrolysis and condensation catalyst, and (iv) a trialkoxysilane compound, is recovered, and does not or substantially does not contain a residual catalyst.EFFECT: Because the present method enables simplified separation of the solid catalyst and the obtained AMS is free from a residual acid catalyst, the present method is advantageous for production of a vulcanizable or vulcanized rubber compound containing the AMS. The method significantly reduces potential VOCs emitted as an alcohol during compounding and further treatments, and can substantially increase an amount of silica used for reinforcement.SELECTED DRAWING: None",BRIDGESTONE CORP,HERGENROTHER WILLIAM L;;PAWLOW JAMES H;;HOGAN TERRENCE E;;HILTON ASHLEY S,,https://lens.org/048-390-428-864-802,Patent Application,no,7,0,15,29,0,B60C1/00;;B60C1/00;;C08G77/08;;C08G77/08;;C08G77/18;;C08G77/18;;C08G77/28;;C08G77/28;;C08K3/013;;C08K3/013;;C08L9/00;;C08L9/00;;C08L21/00;;C08L21/00;;C08L83/06;;C08L83/06;;C08L83/08;;C08L83/08;;Y02P20/584;;Y02P20/584,C08L83/04;;C08L21/00,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The use of solid strong cationic catalysts is advantageous because they remain as solids throughout the reaction, allowing simplified separation of the solid catalyst from soluble AMS or co-AMS products, and resulting in: recovery of the AMS or co-AMS products, the products being free of, or substantially free of residual acid catalyst; and virtual total recovery of the catalyst for recycling.

The use of the solid strong cationic catalysts in the reaction system is advantageous because they remain as solids throughout the reaction, enabling simplified separation of the solid catalysts from the soluble AMS or co-AMS products, resulting in total or near total recovery of the AMS or co-AMS products being free or substantially free of residual acid catalysts, as well as virtually total recovery of the catalysts for recycling.

   A storage server for efficiently retrieving data from a plurality of disks in response to user access requests. The server comprises a plurality of processors coupled to disjoint subsets of disks, and a custom non-blocking packet switch for routing data from the processors to users. By tightly coupling the processors to disks and employing an application-specific switch, congestion and disk scheduling bottlenecks are minimized. By making efficient use of bandwidth, the architecture is also capable of receiving real-time data streams from a remote source and distributing these data streams to requesting users. The architecture is particularly well suited to video-on-demand systems in which a video server stores a library of movies and users submit requests to view particular movies.
