The director base ( 464 ) is positioned adjacent to a mounting base ( 226 ). A first interface between the director base ( 464 ) and the mounting base ( 226 ) is in a first interface plane that is orthogonal to a first axis. The base pivot ( 474 A) provides a base pivot axis for selectively rotating the director base ( 464 ) and the reflective element ( 462 ) relative to the mounting base ( 226 ) about the first axis. The element pivot ( 470 ) guides the rotation of the reflective element ( 462 ) relative to the director base ( 464 ) about a second axis that is orthogonal to the first axis. The first element fastener ( 468 A) is selectively movable between a locked position and an unlocked position to selectively inhibit rotation of the reflective element ( 462 ) relative to the director base ( 464 ) about the second axis.
