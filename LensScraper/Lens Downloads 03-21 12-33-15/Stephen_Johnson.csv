Dans le cas où les conditions extérieures changent et empêchent d'obtenir les densités désirées de rouge, vert et bleu lorsque le module de correction de couleur est utilisé, un module d'ajustement neutre est activé qui prend comme entrées les signaux de commande cible de rouge, vert et bleu du module de correction de couleur et sort des signaux ajustés de rouge, vert et bleu qui sont envoyés au dispositif d'imagerie. La dérivation des paramètres pour le module d'ajustement neutre s'effectue par la production d'une image sur papier de taches de couleur neutre. Les densités des taches sont mesurées et fournies au module de correction de couleur pour déterminer les relations correctes entre les signaux de rouge, vert et bleu sortant du module de correction de couleur et les densités résultantes. Dans un mode préférentiel de réalisation de l'invention, le module d'ajustement neutre est constitué de trois tables de consultation unidimensionnelles.

In order to make high quality reproductions, that is reproductions which correspond in finished color to the color of the original image, the method of the present invention operates upon the original color densities with a color correction module that has as its input the desired red, green, and blue densities, and which outputs the modified red, green, and blue densities which can be considered to be channel-independent aim control signals for the imaging device. In the event that external conditions change which prevent the desired red, green, and blue densities from being achieved when the color correction module is utilized, a neutral adjustment module is activated which takes as its inputs the red, green, and blue aim control signals from the color correction module and outputs adjusted red, green, and blue signals which are directed to the imaging device. The derivation of the parameters for the neutral adjustment module is accomplished by the production of a hardcopy image of neutral color patches. The densities of the patches are measured and provided to the color correction module to determine the correct relationships between red, green, and blue signals output from the color correction module and the resulting densities.

The sealing structure is mounted in the body to engage the disc in the closed position of the latter to provide a high performance (i.e. bubble-tight) seal. The sealing structure includes an annular seal retaining cavity with a slot opening to the flow passage. The structure includes a seal ring of Teflon PFA or the like retained in the cavity and sealing one axial side of the ring from the other. It also has a tongue-like extension projecting through the slot into the passage and having a seat at its end engageable with the sealing surface of the disc. The seal and cavity structures have shoulders normally (in open position of the valve) abutting each other to seal the interior of the cavity (the abutment occurring from expansion of the seal ring into place in the cavity). When the disc radially moves the tongue and seat it also separates the shoulders. Radial spaces are normally provided at opposite sides of the ring and the adjacent sides of the cavity. At the end opposite the slot and tongue the cavity terminates in an anchoring and sealing groove for an extending terminal end of the seal ring. Intermediate the radial spaces and the anchoring groove terminal end are adjacent convergent cavity and ring walls that normally barely abut or are in close proximity to each other. A core of substantial cross-section is located within the main body portion of the ring. When the valve is closed the convergent surfaces are engaged, the main body portion of the ring and the core are compressed and expanded to apply a radially directed force to the tongue and seat forcing them against the disc to effect a static seal. When fluid pressure is applied, the pressure acts in the space at that upstream side between the interior of the cavity and the adjacent exterior of the ring. This results in the ring and core producing an increased radially directed sealing force against the disc.",MCC FLOWSEAL,JOHNSON STEPHEN A,,https://lens.org/193-829-284-959-022,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,F16K1/2263;;F16K1/2263,F16K1/226,277-47,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    An image of certain resolution higher than possible in a single transmission over a finite bandwidth channel is obtained by transferring a progressively-rendered, compressed image. Initially, a low quality image is compressed and transmitted over a finite bandwidth channel. Then, a successively higher resolution image information is compressed at a source and is transmitted. The successively higher resolution image information received at the destination end is used to display a higher resolution image at the destination end.

The sealing structure is mounted in the body to engage the disc in the closed position of the latter to provide a high performance (i.e. bubble-tight) seal. The sealing structure includes an annular seal retaining cavity with a slot opening to the flow passage. The structure includes a seal ring of Teflon, PFA or the like retained in the cavity and sealing one axial side of the ring from the other. It also has a tongue-like extension projecting through the slot into the passage and having a seat at its end engageable with the sealing surface of the disc. The seal and cavity structures have shoulders normally (in open position of the valve) abutting each other to seal the interior of the cavity (the abutment occurring from expansion of the seal ring into place in the cavity). When the disc radially moves the tongue and seat it also separates the shoulders. Radial spaces are normally provided at opposite sides of the ring and the adjacent sides of the cavity. At the end opposite the slot and tongue the cavity terminates in an anchoring and sealing groove for an extending terminal end of the seal ring. Intermediate the radial spaces and the anchoring groove terminal end are adjacent convergent cavity and ring walls that normally barely abut or are in close proximity to each other. A core of substantial cross-section is located within the main body portion of the ring. When the valve is closed the convergent surfaces are engaged, the main body portion of the ring and the core are compressed and expanded to apply a radially directed force to the tongue and seat forcing them against the disc to effect a static seal. When fluid pressure is applied, the pressure acts in the space at that upstream side between the interior of the cavity and the adjacent exterior of the ring. This results in the ring and core producing an increased radially directed sealing force against the disc.",MCC FLOWSEAL A UNIT OF MARK CO,JOHNSON STEPHEN A,NEWMARK ILLINOIS CORPORATION 5202 OLD ORCHARD ROAD SKOKIE ILLINOIS 60077 A CORP.

    A method of changing a preselect altitude value includes receiving an input from a pilot. In response, the preselect altitude value is changed by a first amount from a current preselect altitude value toward a minimum altitude value. The first amount that the preselect altitude value is changed by is dependent upon a proximity of the current preselect altitude value to the minimum altitude value such that if a difference between the current preselect altitude value and the minimum altitude value is greater than a first predetermined interval, the first amount is equal to the first predetermined interval. If the difference between the current preselect altitude value and the minimum altitude value is less than the first predetermined interval, then the first amount is less than the first interval, for example resulting in the preselect altitude value being set directly to the minimum altitude value.

The flange connector 10 is a one-piece steel member having a faceplate 18, opposing faceplate returns 22, flattening bends 24, embedded legs 26 and reinforcing tabs 28. To allow the faceplate 18 to expand during welding, the opposing faceplate returns 22 extend away from the faceplate 18 at approximately ninety degree (90.degree.) angles. The embedded legs 26 then extend from the faceplate returns 22 by way of flattening bends 24 that span between the embedded legs 26 and the faceplate returns 22. The flattening bends 24 extend away from the faceplate returns 22 at an angle that allows the embedded legs 26 to be positioned in a plane substantially parallel to the horizontal surface of the concrete structural members 12.

During initialization, the registers are programmed by an operating system device driver with offsets from a base address and byte counts for each data element within the defined set as those data elements are found within an operating system specific data structure for the I/O transaction, although data elements having a fixed size for each operating system may not require the byte count to be specified.

This allows clips having different durations but having the same PPER to be transmitted to different receivers dependant on channel capacity or reliability. The receiver may compile clips of a selected length by compiling the elements starting at the event marker and adding the elements in a sequence, before and after the event marker, determined by the PPER until a clip of a required length is complete.

   A sensor device includes the ability to determine part presence and at least one physical characteristic of the part. A drive coil and sense coil are arranged so that a voltage applied across the drive coil causes a response in the sense coil, which is influenced by the presence of the item of interest. In a first mode, a controller determines whether the item is present by determining an amount of coupling between the drive coil and the sense coil, which is indicative of whether a part is present near the sense coil. In a second mode, the controller determines an amount of magnetic flux that is indicative of a thickness of the material. In another mode, constant current applied to the drive coil instigates a voltage across both coils. The amplitude of the sense coil voltage and a phase shift of the sense coil voltage relative to the drive coil voltage provides material thickness information.

Stretton, S., and Stretton, S., [trading as Stretton & Sons, S. D.], and Johnson, J. Aug. 22. Circuclar knitting-machines. -Relates to means for changing the pattern of the rib. Two fixed needlecylinders 2, 6, in line, are used. Double-ended needles 19, arranged in suitable sequence in the two cylinders, are transferred from one cylinder to the other, in order to change the pattern of rib, by means of separate jacks having two bits 21, 22, acted on by two cams, shoulders 25, and hooks 23. As a needle is moved, in the process of transference it displaces the opposite jack against the action of spring clasp rings 61, and automatically engages the hook 23. The pointed end of the previously-operating jack then engages with a cam 62, and disengages the needle. When the pattern is to be changed, a lug 27 on a pattern chain acts through a lever 30, and allows a constantly-reciprocated pawl to engage the ratchet-wheel 37. Projections on the wheel cause spring pins 52 to come into range of the star-wheels 58. When the star-wheel is rotated, it moves a cam into or out of action ; when in action, the cam moves the jacks to cause transference. The points of the jacks act as latch guards, until the needles have risen a certain amount, when the curved plate 65, Fig. 11, keeps the latches open until they engage a toothed wheel 67, having pillars 69. These pillars hold open the latches till the needles take the yarn from the guide 69<x>. The jacks may be bent from wire, as shown in Fig. 18. The upper cylinder and cams are supported by the bridgepiece 4 carried on the lower cam ring, and the upper cam-carrier is driven by the lever 15 pivoted at 16 and engaging a stop 18 ; when ordinary non-transferable needles, Fig. 15, are used in certain tricks of the upper cylinder, latch guards or openers, Fig. 16, fixed or operated by a cam, hold the latches open.",STRETTON STEPHEN;;STRETTON SIMEON;;JOHNSON JOSIAH,STRETTON STEPHEN;;STRETTON SIMEON;;JOHNSON JOSIAH,,https://lens.org/007-237-549-370-579,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The retroreflectometer comprises an illumination path and a retroreflection path. The illumination path comprises focusing optics, a source aperture, a beamsplitter and a collimating lens. The retroreflection path comprises a focusing lens, a beamsplitter, a receiver aperture and a receiver. The source aperture shapes the transverse profile of the light to make it appropriate to the measurement. Focusing optics, such as a biconvex lens, may be placed between the light source and the source aperture. After the beam is reflected by the object under test, it enters the retroreflection path of the instrument.

An air passage (“shunt tube”) is placed between a compartment inside the rack, and the ambient air outside the rack, or between compartments inside the rack. Sensors inside the air passage detect movement of the air inside the passage, and thus indirectly measure the presence of a differential pressure. The preferred sensor embodiment uses temperature sensors, and takes advantage of the differences of the air temperatures inside the computer rack, and outside the computer rack (or between internal computer rack compartments) to determine if the air is moving through the air passage, and which direction the air is moving. In response to the measurements, a control system is configured to drive the plenum to a slight vacuum, and then slowly reduce an exhaust fan until the plenum is slightly pressurized, at which point the fan speeds up and again creates a slight vacuum.

    A polarization compensator is disclosed for passing light in a predetermined wavelength range. The compensator has unequal output orthogonal polarizations for light launched into the device within a specific wavelength range. A waveguide having a blazed grating having a blaze angle _{b1 } of between 20 and 45 with respect to the optical axis of the waveguide exhibits a tap efficiency difference for orthogonal polarizations for offsetting and lessening a polarization dependence of the device. This waveguide is optically coupled with the optical device requiring polarization compensation. The grating is oriented about its optical axis to lesson the inequality in output orthogonal polarizations for light launched into the optical device.

In response to the measurements, a control system is configured to drive the plenum to a slight vacuum, and then slowly reduce an exhaust fan until the plenum is slightly pressurized, at which point the fan speeds up and again creates a slight vacuum.

The web (12) is folded around the exterior of the core (14) and includes notches formed in opposing sides of the crotch portion of the web (12). When folded about the core (14), the notched areas form a longitudinally extending opening along the top surface of the core (14). A plurality of elastic bands are affixed along the crotch portion of the web (12) so as to extend substantially parallel to, but inwardly of, the notched areas. The elastic bands constrict the web (12) adjacent the notches to form cuffs which fit snugly about the wearer's legs. Adhesive tabs, or another similar closure device, is attached on opposite sides of the web (12) to hold the garment together about the wearer's torso. Alternatively, opposing sides of the garment may be sealed together to form a pant. Elastomeric material is affixed to strategic positions of the web (12) to increase the elastic force of the web (12) when stretched, to enable the garment to better conform to the wearer's body. Optionally, heat shrinkable film may be disposed about the opening formed by the notches in order to raise the edges of the opening and form a pocket for containing solid waste materials.",PROCTER & GAMBLE,JOHNSON LARRY KENNETH;;LANGE STEPHEN JOSEPH,,https://lens.org/183-208-730-930-138,Granted Patent,yes,5,0,13,13,0,A61F13/15682;;A61F13/49017;;A61F13/49413;;A61F13/15,A61F5/44;;A61F13/15;;A61F13/49,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A server-assisted approach for synchronizing timebases ( 120  and 140 ) in a client-server system utilizes global positioning system (GPS) receivers ( 136  and 110 ) at both the client and server. In a typical implementation, the GPS receiver ( 136 ) associated with the client system receives fragmentary or incomplete data from satellites that are part of the GPS. Thus, the client GPS receiver ( 136 ) is capable of receiving only fragmentary information and cannot derive accurate time signals therefrom. The server system (102) is associated with a GPS receiver ( 110 ) capable of generating accurate time and position data based on signals from GPS satellites ( 114 ). The fragmentary information from the client GPS receiver ( 136 ) is transmitted to the server ( 126 ) along with time information indicating the time at which the client captured the fragmentary GPS data. The server ( 126 ) analyzes the fragmentary GPS data with respect to the complete GPS data available from the GPS receiver ( 110 ) associated with the server. The server ( 126 ) accurately determines the actual time at which the fragmentary GPS data was captured and transmits timing signals to the client ( 146 ). The timing signals are used to correct the client timebase ( 140 ) thus synchronizing the client and server timebases ( 140  and 120 ).

Thus, the integrating board (320, 400) includes connectors (380, 410) mounted thereupon and the contacts associated with the connectors (380, 410) are interconnected by means of electrical conductors formed in the integrating board (320, 400). Herein, the on-board cabling of an aircraft (340, 342, 344, 346) is attached to the first part of connectors (380, 410) on the integrating board (320, 400) and the electrical connectors of the electronic equipment are attached to the respective connectors (380, 410) on the integrating board.EFFECT: provision of higher density of the equipment packaging due to the physical transfer of the wiring couplers in the previously unused space, reduced weight, cost and additional costs of space related to switchboards, reduced labour costs associated with the formation of complex wire harnesses and installation of switchboards, increased system reliability by eliminating extra splices of wires, connectors and wiring segments associated with switchboards.18 cl, 5 dwg",ZE BOING KOMPANI,SHANDER MARK STEPHEN;;JOHNSON ROBERT THOMAS,,https://lens.org/050-300-249-612-589,Granted Patent,no,4,0,15,15,0,Y10T29/49117;;Y10T29/49826;;H05K7/1438;;Y02T50/40;;H05K7/1434;;Y10T29/49117;;Y10T29/49826;;H05K7/1438,H05K7/14;;B64D47/00;;H05K1/18,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

An air passage (""shunt tube"") is placed between a compartment inside the rack, and the ambient air outside the rack, or between compartments inside the rack. Sensors inside the air passage detect movement of the air inside the passage, and thus indirectly measure the presence of a differential pressure. The preferred sensor embodiment uses temperature sensors, and takes advantage of the differences of the air temperatures inside the computer rack, and outside the computer rack (or between internal computer rack compartments) to determine if the air is moving through the air passage, and which direction the air is moving. In response to the measurements, a control system is configured to drive the plenum to a slight vacuum, and then slowly reduce an exhaust fan until the plenum is slightly pressurized, at which point the fan speeds up and again creates a slight vacuum. This allows the rack enclosure to continuously adapt to any changes in cooling requirements, as the computer utilization changes.",WRD CORP;;JOHNSON DOUGLAS A;;BOYD STEPHEN B,JOHNSON DOUGLAS A;;BOYD STEPHEN B,,https://lens.org/075-214-925-363-749,Patent Application,yes,0,8,12,12,0,G06F1/206;;G06F1/206;;H05K7/20209;;H05K7/20209;;H05K7/20145;;H05K7/20145;;H05K7/20572;;H05K7/20572;;H05K7/207;;H05K7/207;;H05K7/20745;;H05K7/20745;;H05K7/20836;;H05K7/20836,H05K7/20,,1,0,,,See references of EP 1917845A4,PENDING

   The optical disc of the present invention includes a first translucent substrate having generally planar opposed top and bottom surfaces. The bottom surface is smooth and adapted to an optical beam for accessing data on the disc. The top surface of the first substrate has formed pits that represent data recorded on the disc. A reflective coating is formed on the top data surface of said first substrate to enable the top surface to reflect light back to an optical reader. A bonding agent is disposed over the reflective coating and a second substrate is bonded to the first substrate thought hot melt bonding. The second translucent substrate has a top surface incorporating a plurality of lenticules formed therein, and a bottom surface having an interlaced segmented lenticular image printed thereon. The method of the present invention provides that the top substrate incorporating lenticular imagery is hot melt bonded through use of a bonding agent to a bottom substrate bearing recorded data and a metalized layer for reflecting optical beams.

The energy is preferably applied to the ink by passing current through a resistor (30) in the wall of the ink container (24) in close proximity to the orifice (26). The initial low energy level or precur­sor signal warms, but does not vaporize, the ink adjacent the resistor (30) so that a larger volume of ink may be vaporized by the high energy pulse, increasing the ejected droplet size. Increasing the energy in the low energy heating increases the ejected droplet size. The low energy heating may be applied in various manners, such as a single long duration pulse, multiple short duration pulses, or the like. Variations in the energy of the precursor pulse for succeeding droplets cause corresponding variations in the sizes of the ejected droplets.

In response to a request for video clip data, identified with reference to the event marker ( 1 ), the discrete elements ( 1, 2, 3, 12 ) of video data making up each clip are allocated to a sequence starting with the element associated with the event marker ( 1 ) and following in an order ( 2, 3, 4 , etc) determined by the pre/post event ratio. This allows clips having different durations but having the same PPER to be transmitted to different receivers dependant on channel capacity or reliability. The receiver may compile clips of a selected length by compiling the elements starting at the event marker and adding the elements in a sequence, before and after the event marker, determined by the PPER until a clip of a required length is complete.

This enables reuse of the existing MDF as well as the cabling from the MDF to the old exchange, which saves cost and also eliminates the need for a lot of changes to cabling documentation and support systems for handling cabling information. When upgrading as described, the new line boards can be designed to provide both voice and DSL services, or else can be made smaller or with higher capacity, so that extra space is freed up for placement of DSL equipment. The new equipment is installed in the same place as the old line board, or at least close enough to the corresponding cabling so that existing line connectors can be used.",ERICSSON TELEFON AB L M,LINDGREN MAGNUS;;DOE STEPHEN;;JOHNSON PETER,TELEFONAKTIEBOLAGET LM ERICSSON (PUBL) (2004-10-21),https://lens.org/087-551-672-326-968,Granted Patent,yes,0,0,16,16,0,H04M3/12;;H04Q1/10;;H04Q1/142;;H04Q2201/12;;H04Q1/20;;H04Q1/03;;H04M7/121;;H04M7/1295;;H04M3/00;;H04M3/22;;H04M7/00;;H04Q1/10;;H04Q1/142;;H04Q2201/12;;H04M3/12;;H04Q1/20;;H04Q1/03;;H04M7/121;;H04M7/1295,H04M3/00,379/328;;379/325,4,0,,,"European Search Report for EP04 44 5112 dated Mar. 24, 2005.;;ATM Port Adapter and Interface Module Installation Guide, 'Online! 2001, XP002322310, Chapter 2.;;Cisco BPX 8600 Series Installation and Configuration, 'Online!
