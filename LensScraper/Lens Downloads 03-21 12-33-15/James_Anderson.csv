Oct. 2. Actuating.-A part only of a bulk of liquid is heated to a predetermined temperature and then permitted to re-enter the main vessel, a fresh supply then occupying the heater, the intermittent operations continuing until the whole bulk is heated. The valve or valves governing communication between the heater and the main vessel are operated by an air chamber in the heater which sinks at lower temperatures but is buoyant at the predetermined temperature. The valve or valves may regulate the outflow of hot water from the heater or the inflow of colder water or both, and the sectional heater may be within or separate from the reservoir. Examples of these modifications are described. The Figure shows a practical adaptation of a separate heater. The hot water outlet 37 is controlled by balanced valves 38 operated by a float 41 open at the bottom and surrounding an inner air chamber or float 42 open only at the top. The outer float has weights 43 and a telescopic sleeve 44 for adjustment. In operation, the outer float and valves lift but the inner float 42 remains down until water enters the annular space between the floats and lifts the inner float also. Cold water flows in from the inlet 35, 36 and on reaching the floats the air contracts and the inner float rises until the flange 45 meets the shoulder 46 on the weight 47. Further cooling causes both floats to sink and close the valves. As the water heats up under the operation of the heater 56, for example an electric heater, the floats and the valves 38 rise again and the hot water escapes through the outlet 37. Provision is made for holding the valves down during adjustment, by a finger 55, the spindle 54 of which is hollow and can contain a thermometer The apparatus may be used in conjunction with or in place of an ordinary range-heated hot water supply system.",ANDERSON JAMES,ANDERSON JAMES,,https://lens.org/124-577-503-581-445,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,F24H1/205,F24H1/20,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

This arrangement provides that since the relay contacts 13 would be open at high motor currents the motor cannot be operated at high loads unless the cooling liquid flow is adequate to close switch contacts 15, but that on the other hand, by the relay contacts 13 being normally closed, operation is permitted at low loads for which no liquid flow is necessary, e.g. when equipment such as mining equipment driven by the motor is being moved from one place to another. The relay coil 12 may be serially connected in one of the A.C. power lines 2 . . . 4 to the motor or, as shown, connected to a current transformer 9, 10 in said line, and may be operated on D.C. by the addition of a half- or full-wave rectifier 11.

Protective arrangements. ANDERSON MAVOR Ltd. Aug. 15, 1963 [May 25. 1962; March 9, 1963; May 15, 1963], Nos. 20119/62; 9462/63 and 19229/63. Heading H2K. An earth-leakage protective and lock-out arrangement comprises a transductor having control windings C1, C2 and balancing windings C3, C4 separately connected to the supply lines, a bias winding C6, A.C. operating windings L1, L2 in series with relay means REL1, REL2 controlling a contactor operating circuit or a circuit-breaker tripping circuit, and a lock-out winding C5 energized on the closing of a switch S1 when the contactor or circuitbreaker is opened. In the arrangement shown, under normal conditions, the effect of the control windings C1, C2 is cancelled by the balancing windings C3, C4, lock-out winding C5 is not energized and the effect of the bias winding C6 is such that sufficient current flows in the winding L1, L2 to energize the relay REL1 which completes the contactor operating circuit. Should an earth fault occur, the leakage current to earth through impedances Z1 .. Z3, rectifier B1 and the control windings C1 C2 unbalances the windings C1, C2 and C3, C4 and the resulting modification of the flux in the transductor core causes a reduction in the current through the windings L1, L2 so that the relay REL1 opens the contactor operating circuit. On the opening of the contactor, switch S1 closes so that D.C. flows from a rectifier B3 through the lock-out winding C5, switch S1, balancing winding C4, rectifier B2, impedances Z4 ... Z6 returning via impedances Z1 . . . Z3, rectifier B1 and control winding C2. If no earth fault exists, the currents in windings C4. C2 balance and the current in winding C5 is balanced by the increased current flowing in the bias winding due to the closing of a switch S2. Should an earth fault exist some current in the lock-out circuit will return through the fault path so unbalancing the effects of the windings C2, C4 and increasing the current in the winding C5. This results in an increase of the current through windings L1, L2 and relay REL2 is sufficiently energized to open its contacts in the contactor operating circuit to prevent the closing of the circuitbreaker. In a modified arrangement, Fig. 2 (not shown), the lock-out winding is directly connected to the supply lines through starconnected impedances and auxiliary switches. Each of these arrangements may be provided with a further relay having operating windings connected in series with the control windings C1, C2 and responding to an increase in voltage on the supply lines due to a faulty supply transformer to open contacts in the contactor operating circuit, Figs. 3 and 4 (not shown).

Auxiliary hydraulic mechanism in a mineral mining machine operating, e.g., the haulage gear and/or the cutter jib of the machine, comprises an hydraulic motor, Fig. 1, supplied with working liquid by first and second pumps 2, 3 of constant and variable output respectively and an overload valve assembly 4 connected between the pumps and motor which on a first predetermined overload of the motor unloads the first pump and on a second predetermined overload of the motor operates hydraulic means to either unload the second pump or regulate its output. The pumps 2, 3, driven by the main or one of the main motors of the machine, deliver pressure liquid through lines 31, 32, and in the case of the pump 2, a check-valve 24, to a manuallyoperable forward-and-reverse motor control valve 7. On a first predetermined overload of the motor 1 a spring-loaded valve 27 is unseated to cause leftward movement of a spring-loaded piston valve 25 to by-pass working liquid from the line 31 to a line 33. On a second predetermined overload of the motor 1 a spring-loaded valve 28 is unseated to direct working liquid through a check-valve 30 to act on the end of a spring-loaded piston valve 21 to connect the left-hand end of a pressure-cylinder 15 through lines 18, 19 with the valve assembly 4. A piston 16 slidable in the cylinder adjusts a fulcrum 13 acting on the lever 12 to regulate the pump output. Bleed ports 27a, 34, 35 allow the valves 27, 21 and the piston 16 to return to their initial positions after the pumps are unloaded. The output of the pump 3 may be regulated or adjusted by a manual adjuster 14. In a modification, the piston valve 21 and the piston and cylinder 16, 15 are omitted.

Fluid-pressure servomotor control systems. ANDERSON, BOYES & CO. Ltd. Dec. 12, 1957 [May 10, 1957], No. 14983/57. Class 135. In auxiliary hydraulic mechanism in a mineral mining machine actuating the haulage gear and/or the slewing of the cutter jib, a variable output pump 3 supplying pressure liquid to the hydraulic motor 1 driving the mechanism is controlled by the piston 16 of a device 5 under the control of the piston valve 21 of a pilot device 6 responsive through electromagnetic means 50 to increases and decreases in current load of an electric motor 51 driving the machine. The device 5 is connected by lines 18, 19 to pump output and the pilot device 6 respectively. On small increases in current load the valve 21 moves leftwardly to connect the line 19 to the line 18 through a two-way restriction 54 so that a fulcrum 13 engaging a lever 12 connecting the pump to a crank arm 10 driven by the motor 51 is slowly moved to reduce pump output. Should the current load exceed a predetermined maximum, the valve 21 is moved further to the left to directly connect the line 19 to the line 18 to cause rapid movement of the fulcrum 13 and reduction in pump output. The pump supplies the motor 1 through an overload valve 4 and a hand-operated forward-and-reverse control valve 7. Should the motor 1 experience a predetermined overload, spring-loaded valves 28, 30 will open to connect the pump discharge to act on the right-hand side of the valve 21 to again reduce pump output. A spring-loaded valve 29 ensures that the pressure is sufficient to operate the valve 21. Pump output may be manually controlled by a hand adjuster 14. In a modification, the line from the valve 30 instead of being connected to the pilot device 6 is connected to twin opposed, spring-loaded pistons movable to engage a finger on the actuating rod 43 of the control valve 7 to selectively control the latter valve.

Rapid expansion of the superheated steam is utilised to operate the engine and deliver 5 output power. The engine (10) comprises a body (11) in which is rotatably supported a central output shaft (12). The output shaft (12) comprises two shaft end sections (13) which extend from opposite ends of the body (11) for delivery of output shaft power. A flywheel (14) is supported between the two shaft sections (132). The flywheel (14) accommodates a swash plate mechanism (15) which is 10 drivingly mounted on the shaft (12). A bank of input shafts (23) is provided on each side of the swash plate mechanism (15). Each input shaft (23) comprises the piston shaft (25) of a double-headed piston structure (27) having a working piston head (29) and a pumping piston head (31) each mounted on the piston shaft (25). The double-headed piston structures (27) are each accommodated within a 15 respective cylinder (35) within the body (11). Each cylinder (35) is divided by its double-headed piston structure (27) into three chambers, being a working chamber (51), a pumping chamber (52) and a transition chamber (53). The working chamber (51) is defined between the working piston head (29) and an adjacent part (43) of the body 11. The pumping chamber (52) is defined between 20 the pumping piston head (31) and an adjacent part (39) of the body (11). The transition chamber (53) is defined between the two piston heads (29, 31). An air pressure chamber (65) is provided for accommodating pressurised air for delivery to the working chambers (51). A heater (71) is provided for heating air contained within the air pressure chamber (65). An inlet valve means (91) is associated with 25 each working chamber (51) for controlling intake air flow from the air pressure chamber (65) into the working chamber upon volume expansion of the working chamber. An exhaust valve means (103) is associated with each working chamber (51) for controlling exhaust flow from the working chamber (5)1 to the exhaust chamber (67). An air valve means (111) is provided for controlling air flow 30 from the exhaust chamber (67) into the pumping chamber (52) upon volume expansion thereof and ( 6)5 upon volume reduction of the pumping chamber (52). An injection means (150) is provided for injecting working fluid in the form of water - 26 into the working chamber (51). The injection means (150) injects a metered quality of water into the working chamber(51) as the working chamber completes a compression stroke, at which stage the air (which was previously introduced into the working chamber in a heated and pressurised state) has been further 5 compressed to significantly increase its pressure and temperature. Upon its injection, the water interacts with the heated and pressurised air to produce superheated steam which expands rapidly and causes the piston structure(27) to undergo a power stroke.

They can be excavated well below the groundwater table, then lined with an impermeable or other permanent liner. This allows the landfill area to be much more efficiently used for the storage of various waste products. Solid organic waste other than cellulosics can be anaerobically fermented to methane and compost. A central core shaft is used as gas removal vent and conduit. After methane generation and removal the resulting compost is removed for use as soil nutrients. This system fully complies with the Environmental Protection Act and other regulations now in force in North America. Air, soil, groundwater, and surface water pollution and contamination are eliminated as all waste storage is contained within its own environment below natural grade.",ANDERSON JAMES S,ANDERSON JAMES S,,https://lens.org/125-432-808-294-606,Granted Patent,yes,26,32,1,2,0,B09B1/008;;B09B3/00;;E02D29/12;;C12M21/04;;C12M23/18;;Y02W30/20;;Y02P20/145;;Y02P20/59;;C05F17/90;;Y02W30/40;;E02D29/12;;B09B3/00;;B09B1/008;;C12M23/18;;C12M21/04;;Y02W30/20;;Y02P20/145;;Y02P20/59;;C05F17/90;;Y02W30/40,B09B1/00;;B09B3/00;;C05F17/02;;E02D29/12,405/129;;405/133;;405/150.1;;405/270,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

To prevent explosive conditions in a chemical reactor, the flow of gas to the reactor is measured and compared with a lagged signal representing a previous measurement so that a reduction in the flow-rate is demanded if the difference exceeds a predetermined value. As shown, electrical signals dependent the rate of flow of gas to a reactor, measured at 1, are applied to a D.C. summing amplifier 8 directly through a resistor 7 and indirectly in the opposite sense through a resistor 6 after delay in a unit A formed by a D.

    A wireless personal communication system includes an earpiece, worn in or behind the ear, that communicates wirelessly with a remote processor unit (RPU) worn at the neck. The RPU is a wearable computer in the form of a necklace, neck ribbon, collar or other flat, flexible article that may be worn under clothing to hide it from view. The close proximity of the earpiece to the RPU, combined with the large antenna aperture area available in this RPU form, enables the use of radar technology to implement a two-way wireless link between the earpiece and RPU, and also allows earpiece operating power to be beamed from the RPU. The resulting size and cost reductions in both the earpiece and RPU allow the manufacture of disposable hearing aids and, when the RPU is equipped with secondary wireless link circuitry, cellular telephones and pagers.

Convertible tandems; multicycles; frames.-Relates to a single-track cycle made up of independent sections so as to be convertible for use by any number of riders from two upwards. Fig. 5 shows a quadricycle for four riders. Each section 1, 2, 3, 4 is fitted with a driving-wheel and saddle, the frames being of the form shown. The front section 1 is coupled to the following section 2 by lugs G projecting from the latter and connected by ball bearings with the tube D. A rod passing through the tube D carries the ball-bearing cones. The other sections are coupled together, as at 10, by links pivoted to the sections and connected by vertical pivot pins with ball bearings. Handlebars Ware fitted as shown. The front rider steers by means of the handle-bar X. The cycle is convertible into two tandems by undoing the central couplings. The front and rear sections, if coupled together, also form a tandem. Various combinations may be made of the three types of sections 1, 2, and 4 shown in the Figures. Steering-mechanism ; handle-bars ; the saddle supports.-The handles X, Fig. 3, of the front section are mounted in horizontal sockets M, and are clamped by nuts B. When these nuts are loosened, the handle-bars can be adjusted or folded down for transport &c. The sockets M are mounted on a stem fitted with ball bearings, which carries a toothed sector A<1> gearing with a sector J fixed to the lug G on the following section. The other handle-bars W and the seat pillars are adjustably fixed in their sockets by the clamping-device shown in Fig. 3. The split socket R<1> is provided with lugs in which works a right and left handed screw S' carried by a handle S, so that, when the handle is raised, it brings the lugs together. A projection R<2> on the handle engages a groove in the handle-bar stem or seat pillar, to prevent lateral displacement.",ANDERSON JAMES CALDWELL,ANDERSON JAMES CALDWELL,,https://lens.org/120-205-904-280-501,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The separation is effected by passing a stream of the gaseous isotopic elements or compounds at high velocity into a low-molecular-weight stopping gas. The heavier isotopes travel farther through the stopping gas than the light isotopes in a given time and a spatial separation is thus achieved. The high velocity isotope stream is produced by acceleration of the isotope mixture in a low-molecular-weight carrier gas during passage through a nozzle into the region of the stopping gas. A flow of the stopping gas is maintained to remove the isotopes from the region of the high velocity stream. This flow is subsequently split into streams each enriched in one of the isotopes. The stopping gas is maintained at low temperature, either by expansion or by conventional refrigeration techniques, to enhance the degree of separation.",US ENERGY,ANDERSON JAMES B,,https://lens.org/017-591-683-640-634,Granted Patent,yes,1,4,1,1,0,B01D59/18;;B01D59/18,B01D59/18,55/17,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Luminescent materials: fluorescent discharge lamps. BRITISH THOMSONHOUSTON CO., Ltd. Nov. 24, 1952 [Jan. 14, 1952], No. 1039/52. Class 39(1). A method of applying a coating of a powdered phosphor to the envelope of a fluorescent discharge lamp consists in forming a suspension of the powdered phosphor in a subsequently removable binder, to which suspension silica or magnesia is added as a separate constituent, applying the suspension to the wall of the envelope so that the silica or magnesia is deposited on the wall and around the particles of the phosphor simultaneously with the phosphor without the addition of any chemical compound to cause the precipitation of the silica or magnesia, and then removing the binder by heat. The silica or magnesia can be replaced by a compound thereof which will release silica or magnesium during heating to remove the binder. The silica can be incorporated in nitro-cellulose solution used as a binder by adding thereto a colloidal solution of silica in an organic solvent, e.g. material known under the Trade Name "" Silicaseal."" The preferred proportion of silica or magnesia is from 0À1 to 10 per cent of the weight of the phosphor. Specification 626,657 is referred to. The Provisional Specification describes also methods in which (a) the silica or magnesia is coated inside the lamp envelope from a nitrocellulose suspension, the nitrocellulose being then removed by heat and the silica or magnesia covered by a phosphor ; (b) the silica or magnesia is milled along with the phosphor in making the phosphor suspension which is then applied to the envelope ; (c) the silica or magnesia or a compound thereof is milled with nitro-cellulose solution to form a suspension which is applied to the envelope and the nitrocellulose then removed by heat, a suspension of a phosphor such as cadmium borate then being applied to the envelope ; (d) the envelope is coated with a solution containing silica and a resin which is removed by heat as described in Specifications 712,185, [Group IV(a)], and 722,802, and the resin removed by heat leaving a coating of silica which is then covered by a coating of a phosphor.",BRITISH THOMSON HOUSTON CO LTD,ANDERSON JAMES THOMSON,,https://lens.org/066-761-259-264-621,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,C09K11/025;;H01J9/223,C09K11/02;;H01J9/22,C3S S33Y          -;;C3S S43Y          -;;C3S S705          -;;C3S S71Y          -;;C3S S714          -;;C3S S748          -;;C4S S33Y          -;;C4S S43Y          -;;C4S S705          -;;C4S S71Y          -;;C4S S714          -;;C4S S748          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Liquid meters of the piston type. The lower part of the casing 1 is formed as a cylinder to receive the piston 4, and the upper part is open and the walls inclined to form a seating for a valve-box 3. This box has inclined side walls formed integral with an arc-shaped top, and at the bottom rests upon the top of the piston, which is provided with a wing 5 adapted to fit between partitions 6, 7 in the box 3. The wing has spring- pressed packing-pieces 5<a> which are forced against the partitions to prevent leakage. Passages 8, 9 in the casing lead to ports 10, 11, 12 in the inclined walls adapted to register with ports 13, 14, 15, 16 in the sides of the box 3. The inlet and outlet passages 23, 24 communicate with the passages 8, 9, and also with ports 27, 28 in out-off devices 25, 26 which are suitably packed and pressed into contact with the piston by means of springs 30. The piston 4 is hollow with a central portion 31 through which are formed ports 32, 33 communicating by passages 35, 36 with opposite sides of the piston. The ends of the cylinder are closed by screw caps 42 provided with recesses to receive a wrench. A pin 51 on the piston operates a starwheel 49 on a suitably-packed spindle 50, the motion of the spindle being transmitted by spur gearing to the registering-mechanism located within the cover 44 of the casiog. A rib 54 on this cover presses on the box 3 to assist the liquid pressure in keeping the box on its seating. In operation, the piston has a combined linear and oscillating movement, water being admitted alternately to each side of the piston and the wing 5 and then expelled. When the piston is in the position shown in Fig. 2, part of the stream of water passes by way of the port 32 to the left-hand side of the piston and operates the same, the other part nf the stream passing through the ports 8, 12 and through the passage 15 to the wing 5 to oscillate the piston. Any water on the right-hand side of the piston or the opposite side of the wing 5 is expelled through the ports 33, 9 and flows out of the outlet 24. The combined linear and oscillating movement of the piston and the linear movement of the box 3 bring the various ports into the required position for alternately admitting and exhausting water from the opposite sides of the piston and wing 5. To steady the motion of the piston, a wrist-pin 37 connected therewith has a spherical extremity seating in a recess in a ring 39 adapted to rotate about a pin 41 on a washer 40 fixed to, or formed integral with, the cap plate.",ANDERSON JAMES CALDWELL,ANDERSON JAMES CALDWELL,,https://lens.org/148-469-985-198-301,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   A geographical information system and a method are disclosed for geospatially mapping at least one parcel polygon within a geographical region and for displaying at least one specific attribute of each parcel polygon, i.e. a topological area within the given geographical region, as an attached attribute of latitude and longitude coordinates. The centroid or center point of each of the parcel polygons is determined and stored into conventional computer storage means. The latitude and longitude point feature at the centroid of each parcel polygon is established and similarly stored. A unique tax identification number, e.g. the Assessor Parcel Number (APN) or Parcel Identifier Number (PIN), is assigned to each of the point features. A correlation is then made between the unique tax identification number of the point feature to a text list of at least one attribute, e.g., the physical address of the parcel polygon, of each of the point features. This attribute becomes attached to each point feature. The resulting parcel polygon map and point features with one or more of the attached attributes can then be displayed within a GIS or CAD system to provide the user, for example, accurate locations of street addresses for use in environments that require pinpoint accuracy, such as emergency response.

The latitude and longitude point feature at the centroid of each parcel polygon is established and similarly stored. A unique tax identification number, e.g. the Assessor Parcel Number (APN) or Parcel Identifier Number (PIN), is assigned to each of the point features. A correlation is then made between the unique tax identification number of the point feature to a text list of at least one attribute, e.g., the physical address of the parcel polygon, of each of the point features. This attribute becomes attached to each point feature. The resulting parcel polygon map and point features with one or more of the attached attributes can then be displayed within a GIS or CAD system to provide the user, for example, accurate locations of street addresses for use in environments that require pinpoint accuracy, such as emergency response.",GIS DATA RESOURCES LLC;;LEADDOG CONSULTING LLC,ANDERSON JAMES J,,https://lens.org/071-979-663-666-262,Granted Patent,no,0,0,5,5,0,G06T17/05;;G06T17/05,G01C21/00;;G01C21/26;;G06F17/50;;G06T17/00;;G06T17/05,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Stamps, ore and like; crushers with vibrating jaws.-In a modification of the ore stamp described in Specification No. 24,277, A.D. 1903, the mortars 8, Figs. 2 and 3, are mounted upon the ends of a vibrating rocker or lever 7 so that the momentum shock of each stamp in its mortar will, while crushing the ore, cause the opposite mortar with its anvil to rise and deliver an upward blow against its stamp, at the same time actuating the vibrating jaws 53 of a crusher arranged above the mortars. The stamps are raised by means of oscillating latches 28 pivoted to the ends of a lever 22 carried by the arch-shaped casting 10. Rods 74, Fig. 4, connected to the ends of a cross-head 73 reciprocated by the piston-rod 72 of an hydraulic cylinder 65 are pivotally connected to wrist pins or lugs 75 on the bifurcated crank-arm 24 of the lever 22. The oscillating valve 70 regulating the water supply to the cylinder 65 is operated by a controller valve 71 actuated by a rod 77 connected to an extension 76 of one of the side-rods 74. The upper face of the vertical arm of the latch 28 engages under a collar 32 on the stamp-stem 33, and at the end of the upward movement of the stamp the horizontal arm of the latch comes into contact with the top of an I-shaped piece 35 carried by the spring-operating rod 36, causing the latch to turn on its pivot and release the collar 32, thus allowing the stamp to fall. At the end of the downward stroke of the lever 22, the horizontal arm of the latch contacts with the lower end of the piece 35 and ensures that the vertical arm of the latch engages under the collar 32. The caps 45 closing the upper ends of the mortars are formed with vertical extensions against which the inner ends of the toggles 49 which actuate the vibrating jaws 53 bear. A piece 61 directs the ore crushed by the jaws 53 to the throats 62 of the mortars. Screens 63<x> are arranged in the three outer sides of each mortar, and the exhaust water from the cylinder 65 is carried by pipes 64 to the mortars. A cushioned anvil or stop 5 below each end of the rocker 7 limits the vibration of the latter.",ANDERSON JAMES CALDWELL,ANDERSON JAMES CALDWELL,,https://lens.org/030-796-053-453-711,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

    A process and apparatus for planting aquatic plants underwater on the bottom of estuaries in propeller scars and for encouraging plant growth in propeller scars. Aquatic plant shoots are transplanted by positioning shoots in a sediment tube which is in turn placed in the propeller scar. When the sediment tube is placed in the propeller scar the sea grass shoots are held in position for an extended period of time to allow the sea grass shoots to take root on the estuary bottom. The sediment tubes may be preformed or they may be formed just prior to their placement in the estuary. A watercraft may be used to position the sediment tubes with and without sea grass shoots over an area of the propeller scar. With the process and apparatus of this invention, sea grass plants can be replanted on the bottom of an estuary and new plant growth encouraged in propeller scars. Further in accordance with another embodiment of this invention a tube or other obstruction without plant shoots is placed in a propeller scar in order to impede water flow through the propeller scar. When water flow through the propeller scar is impeded natural plant growth is encouraged.

Liquid meters.-Locking means are provided for securing the registering mechanism of a liquid meter against fraudulent manipulation. Figs. 1 and 3 show the invention as applied to a meter of the piston type. The piston 2 has a circular race 4. which is engaged by a stud 5 screwed into the casing 6 for the purpose of limiting the movement of the piston and preventing its withdrawal from the cylinder. The first gear-wheel 7 of the registering mechanism is mounted on a spindle carrying a toothed wheel 10 engaged by a pin 11 on the piston. The mechanism is enclosed by a glazed cap 12 provided with a hinged protecting cover 13. Dowel pins 15, between the cap and casing, prevent the cap from being twisted should the screw 16 be removed. A latch ur keeper 17 secured to the casing by the stud 5 is provided with a stepped arm 19, which projects over a pocket in the casing. A boss on the cap enters this pocket, and is provided with a gate to clear the arm 19. An index dial 22 is located in a recess in the cap and has a number of radial slots, one of which is engaged by a feather on a spindle 25. On a square part of this spindle is mounted a disc or tumbler 27 carrying a ring 29 for engaging internal projections on other tumblers 30, 33 mounted on the tumbler 27. The tumblers are gated to pass the arm 19, and, when the gates are out of register, they take under the steps on this arm to secure the cap. The tumblers are separated by gated washers and a cap 38 secured to the boss which encloses the tumblers. By rotating the spindle, so as to bring the disc into a position predetermined by the combination, the gates in the tumblers are brought into register with the steps of the arm, so that the cap can be removed. The head of the spindle is provided with a V-shaped cut for the insertion of a turning tool. The downward pressure exerted in turning the spindle frees the tumblers from engagement with the steps on the arm, so that the combination cannot be determined by the sense of touch.",ANDERSON JAMES CALDWELL,ANDERSON JAMES CALDWELL,,https://lens.org/141-527-661-795-087,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Oct. 21. Slide rules.-In a slide rule of the dial type, logarithms are marked off in units of angle on a spiral curve, whereby the diminishing first-difference of the logarithm is balanced by the increase in the linear scale on which setting takes place. Graduated radial arms carry scales indicating t e points at which results are to be looked for. The inner and outer discs, Fig. 1, can be relatively rotated, and may have their circumferences divided into corresponding coloured sections I, J, K, L. The index arm A is attached to a barrel-piece Q, Fig. 2, clamped on the central spindle P, by the screw R, the traveller arm C being also centrally pivoted and carrying a scale E which can slide radially. Pointers D, B can be clamped to this scale, and both have reading edges for the edge scale of the arm C, while B has also an edge reading on the slide. The fixed scales on the two arms are coloured according to the quadrants. A supplementary arm T, sliding telescopically under the central disc, can be drawn out at the 100 graduation by means of a stud W, and is used in three factor multiplications and divisions in order to clamp the index arm one factor in front or behind it, before setting for the other two factors in the usual manner. Constants may be marked on the scales and the units and subdivisions distinguished by different colourings.",ANDERSON FRANCIS JAMES,ANDERSON FRANCIS JAMES,,https://lens.org/138-945-241-818-020,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

    Embodiments of a data storage tape control system are disclosed that works to prevent or reduce frequency of off-track errors. The invented method slows tape speed in response to the writing head or writing element moving transversely away from a track center a predetermined distance, called an off-center limit, wherein the off-center limit is part of the way to an off-track error limit. The off-center limit is close enough to the center of the track that the writing operation is still effective, but wherein further movement out from the center would result in an off-track error and possible overwriting or unreadable data. The tape speed reduction is preferably done in increments until the writing head/element is closer to the center of the track than the off-center limit. Speed reduction is preferably done concurrently with writing, so that writing is not interrupted. Although the tape speed is reduced, the overall efficiency of writing may be increased compared to an operation in which off-track errors and writing failures occur repeatedly, at least in part because of high tape speeds.

ANDERSON. 15 Oct., 1968 [16 Oct., 1967], No. 48703/68. Headings F2G and F2P. A submersible pipe 10 adapted to extend vertically in a body of water is constructed of a plurality of pipe sections 12 joined at 14, each pipe section being formed of a plurality of parallel discrete tubes 32, each of said tubes being sealed at its ends against the entry of liquid and to the exterior of adjacent tubes along the length thereof to render the pipe section wall substantially leakproof. The tubes are sealed to each other along their lengths by gaskets 34 of resilient material, e.g. rubber, which are cemented, moulded or clamped between the tubes. In a modification, Fig. 9 (not shown), the gaskets are integrally merged into a liner which protects the tubes from through-flow particles. The ends of adjacent pipe sections are joined by a flanged ring 38 to which double-ended plugs 36 sealing the ends of aligned tube ends are bolted. A gasket is disposed between plugs and rings 14 to give the pipe sections flexibility. In a modification, Figs. 6 and 7 (not shown), the adjacent ends of tubes of adjacent pipe sections are each sealed by a respective plug 41 or 43, the plugs 41 and 43 being joined by a snap ring 47 and the plug 43 having bosses 54 which are bolted to the flanged ring 38. In a further modification, Figs. 8 and 9 (not shown), plugs 56 and 58 of sealing aligned tube ends of adjacent sections are screwed together. The pipe 10 may be about 24 feet in diameter and constructed of 8-inch steel tubes, said pipe being of hundreds or thousands of feet long. The construction of pipe sections gives the pipe 10 when submerged a buoyancy which reduces the tensile stresses in the pipe due to the weight of the pipe.",ANDERSON JAMES HILBERT,ANDERSON JAMES HILBERT,,https://lens.org/032-683-614-486-217,Granted Patent,no,0,0,5,5,0,E21B17/012;;F16L1/24;;F16L11/133;;F16L11/22;;Y10T137/402;;Y10T137/402;;F16L11/133;;E21B17/012;;F16L11/22;;F16L1/24,E21B17/01;;F16L1/24;;F16L11/133;;F16L11/22,F2G G2J           G2J;;F2P PF11          PF11;;F2P PF23          PF23;;F2P PTP           PTP;;F2P P1A14         -;;F2P P1A2          -;;F2P P1A3          -;;F2P P1B5B         -;;F2P P1B5D         -;;F2P P23D          -;;F2P P23F          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The base may be capable of cold flow embossment, may be of metal, e.g. copper or aluminium, or of plastics, and may take the form of a sheet or strip, possibly a continuous roll of strip. The coating may be provided on one surface of the base, possibly overlying substantially the whole of the surface. The coating may be thinner than the base and may be bonded thereto, the bond being broken upon embossment, in correspondence with the embossed portions, to permit removal of the coating. The coating may be of a colour which contrasts with the colour of the base and may comprise a vinyl chloride solution modified with melamine resin, or a vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer having reactive carboxyl groups of maleic acid. The remote side of the base 13 may carry a layer of adhesive 17 which may be provided with a tear-off strip 18. An embossed article is produced by applying; to one surface of a base material capable of embossment, a coating which is more brittle than the base, securing a removable pressure-sensitive adhesive tear strip over said coating, embossing the material to produce offset embossed portions thereon and to fracture the coating in correspondence with the offset embossed portions, and removing the coating in correspondence with the embossed portions by removing the tear strip.",DYMO INDUSTRIES INC,ANDERSON JAMES DUNLAP,,https://lens.org/058-438-741-076-32X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,4,4,0,B29C59/026;;B44C3/082;;G09F3/02;;G09F13/06,B29C59/02;;B44C3/08;;G09F3/02;;G09F13/06,B5S S17Y;;B5S S199;;B5S S22X;;B5S S22Y;;B5S S234;;B5S S25X;;B5S S25Y;;B5S S250;;B5S S252;;B5S S253;;B5S S254;;B5S S255;;B5S S26X;;B5S S265;;B5S S266;;B5S S30X;;B5S S300;;B5S S303;;B5S S304;;B5S S371;;B5S S42X;;B5S S428;;B5S S540;;B5S S548;;B5S S55X;;B5S S574;;B5S S577;;B5S S582;;B5S S585;;B5S S586;;B5S S62X;;B5S S62Y;;B5S S620;;B5S S63X;;B5S S659;;B5S S668;;B5S S669;;B5S S701;;B5S S702;;B5S S71X;;B5S S714;;B5S S781;;B5S S807;;B6J JB7           JB7,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A single cooling tower structure may be modified internally to provide plural flow paths separate from each other.",ANDERSON JAMES H,ANDERSON JAMES H,,https://lens.org/119-271-949-976-107,Granted Patent,no,7,26,1,1,0,F01K9/003;;F28B7/00;;F28C1/00;;Y10S261/11;;Y02B30/70;;F28B7/00;;F01K9/003;;F28C1/00;;Y10S261/11,F01K9/00;;F28B7/00;;F28C1/00,261/151,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

April 22. Slide rules. - A long scale for a common logarithmic slide rule is broken up into parts of equal length, each representing numbers between consecutive integral powers of some chosen power of 10, these parts being placed as parallel scale s, one above the other, upon the two limbs or edges of the rule, the slider being similarly divided. In operating, addition or subtraction of numbers borne by the scales produces the number of the scale upon which the result will be found with the decimal point in the correct position, in a manner analogous to the use of the characteristics of logarithms. The graduations of the scales upon one limb are twice the size of those upon the other, whereby numbers may be squared and cubed, or the corresponding roots taken. Fig. 4 shows a rule with an upper limb A divided into parts representing numbers from 1 to #10, #10 to 10, and so on, a similar slide B, and a lower limb with double length graduations, i.e., with sections from 1 to <4>#10, <4>#10 to #10, and so on, these graduations thus representing, in position, the logarithms of the squares of the same numbers on the upper limb. Fig. 7 shows a glass cursor and frame, bearing the characteristic numbers A', B<1>, C' of the three scales, corresponding numbers appearing upon transverse index bars, Fig. 8, borne one at each end of the slide. In multiplying, the left or right index of the slide is placed against one factor on the upper limb, and the product found on the same limb exactly over the reading of the other factor on the slide. The characteristic number of the product scale is the sum of the two factor scales in the case of the left index, or the sum increased by unity in the case of the right index. Similar rules hold for other operations. Slides with trigonometrical and other scales may be used, and constants specially marked upon the limbs, colours being, preferably, used to distinguish unit from subdivision marks. The arrangement renders any system of subdividing the units possible.",ANDERSON FRANCIS JAMES,ANDERSON FRANCIS JAMES,,https://lens.org/185-022-888-041-602,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Accordingly, the counter weight that is required for preventing the carriage 24 from swinging by this force by coinciding both positions can be made extremely small, thereby a servo system with a superior responsiveness is obtained.",HEWLETT PACKARD CO,ANDERSON JAMES C,,https://lens.org/180-177-351-321-983,Patent Application,no,0,2,6,6,0,G11B5/5504;;H02K41/0356;;G11B5/5504;;H02K41/0356,G11B5/56;;G11B5/55;;G11B5/588;;H02K41/035,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Oct. 12, 1904, [date applied for under Patents Act, 1901). Kinematographs. - Relates to a camera for taking a number of successive photographs on a plate, film, or the like, in more or less rapid succession, the camera being also adapted to be used as an ordinary one for taking ordinary photographs. When the camera is used for taking multiple photographs, the plate is moved intermittently across the light aperture, and it may be dropped a step at each end of its motion to enable a number of rows of photographs to be taken on one plate. The back B, which may be applied to any suitable camera, contains a removable diaphragm 2, the light aperture 3 in which can be adjusted, according to the number of rows of photographs it is desired to produce, by a vertically adjustable hinged flap 4, Fig. 3, engaged by a catch 7 at one end and carried by an adjustable rod 6 at the other end. The plate holder 13 and its sheath 14 are provided with vertical guides 11 carried by a base 8 mounted on rollers 9. In producing photographs in rapid succession, the plate is moved horizontally intermittently by a pin on a chain 31 engaging a slotted part 33 hinged to the carrier. The chain 31 passes over sprocket-wheels operated by pawl and ratchet-wheel gearing 26 connected, as shown, to a crank spindle 19. The plate holder 13 has a pin 16 engaging a slot in the cover 14 and adapted to engage a hook 18 to hold the two parts together when removed from the camera. Before exposure, the holder and its cover are raised until a pin 35 engages a catch 36, and the pin 16 is brought above the upper of a series of guide shelves 38 arranged as shown. When the plate is moved into position to take the first photograph, the pin 35 is released, and the cover 14 drops. The distance the plate drops at the end of a row of photographs is determined by the guide shelves 38, which can be adjusted by their projecting ends 39, Fig. 4, so as to allow the plates to fall through a distance equal to the space between any number of shelves at once. When the camera makes its last reciprocation, it trips an indicator 40. To prevent exposure during the motion of the plate, there is used a shutter composed of two semicircular parts 41, 42 mounted on a shaft 43 operated in unison with the photographic plate by the gearing shown. The size of the shutter aperture 45 is adjusted by moving one part 42 with respect to the other part 41, the two parts being held together by locking- devices 44. When the camera is used as a multipleview camera with time exposures, the shutter is folded up, and the operating-gearing is dispensed with, the plate carrier being moved horizontally by a bar graduated to enable the carrier to be moved the proper distance ; when it is used as an ordinary plate camera, the diaphragm 2 may be removed also, and the plate-holder guides are arranged horizontally and the plate &c. holder is moved into and out of its cover by a rod engaging the pin 16.",ANDERSON JAMES WILLIAM,ANDERSON JAMES WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/195-764-219-810-06X,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   A process and apparatus for planting aquatic plants underwater on the bottom of estuaries in propeller scars and blowouts and for encouraging plant growth in these propeller scars and blowouts. Aquatic plant shoots are transplanted by positioning shoots, plants or seeds in a sediment tube or sediment bag which is in turn placed in a propeller scar or blowout. When the sediment tube or sediment bag is placed in the propeller scar or blowout aquatic plant growth is facilitated. The sediment tubes and sediment bags may be preformed or they may be formed just prior to their placement in the estuary. A watercraft may be used to position the sediment tubes and sediment bags with and without sea grass shoots, plants or seeds, in propeller scar propeller scar. With the process and apparatus of this invention, sea grass plants can be replanted on the bottom of an estuary and new plant growth encouraged in propeller scars and blowouts.. Further in accordance with another embodiment of this invention a tube or other obstruction without plant shoots, plants or seeds is placed in a propeller scar in order to impede water flow through the propeller scar. When water flow through the propeller scar is impeded natural plant growth is encouraged. The material from which the sediment tube or bag is formed from degrades. The degration of the sediment tube or bag can be correlated to the growing cycle of seagrass plants, shoots or seeds as may be contained in the sediment tube or bag.

Motor road vehicles. - Relates to motor carriages, and comprises a construction of such a carriage in sections articulated together. each section being supported on two wheels and having seats for two or three persons. Fig. 1 shows in elevation, and Fig. 2 in plan, a vehicle composed of two sections ; modifications with three sections are also shown in the Specification. The frames, built of tubes A, B, C, E, are articulated together at the upper and lower ends of centrally-situated vertical tubes F, F<1>. The tube F carries brackets G, through which passes a long bolt or pivot having ball bearings in the tube F<1>. The wheel forks P, in the example shown, are horizontal, and are pivoted on journals N projecting from the frames, the weight of the vehicle being supported on the wheel axles through the medium of plunger rods S and springs located in tubular receptacles V forming part of the frame. The springs are cylindrical rubber bodies having longitudinal cells inflated by means of liquid air or other expansible substance. The independence of the wheels allows the vehicle to accommodate itself readily to uneven roads. Any suitable motive power may be employed, such power being applied through the medium of sprocket chains C' driven by chainwheels B<1> at the ends of a divided balance shaft. The balance gear employed is shown in Fig. 3. The two portions 6, 6 of the divided shaft are geared together by a chain 12 having the alternate links pivoted together at right-angles. This chain passes over sprocket-wheels on the two parts of the shaft and on a transverse shaft 8 mounted in the driving-box 1. In addition to the articulation at G, the several sections of the vehicle are connected together by links 22, by means of which steering is effected. These links are connected at the front end to arms 21, one above and one below the horizontal rock shaft 15. An adjustment of this rock shaft causes the sections to move relatively to each other, so that the wheel axles radiate from a centre, enabling the vehicle to be steered.",ANDERSON JAMES CALDWELL,ANDERSON JAMES CALDWELL,,https://lens.org/105-102-019-039-808,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

A parent cache controller reads, in response to a memory request from a child processor and an address translation pattern from the parent processor, a set of data from non-contiguous addresses of the data cache according to the address translation pattern, and writes the set of data to contiguous addresses of the dual port memory associated with the requesting child processor.",XILINX INC,ANDERSON JAMES B,XILINX INC (2007-01-19),https://lens.org/112-879-822-313-243,Granted Patent,yes,0,4,1,1,0,G06F12/0284;;G06F12/0806;;G06F12/0879;;G06F15/167;;G06F12/0284;;G06F12/0879;;G06F15/167;;G06F12/0806,G06F12/00,711/149;;711/131;;712/31,4,0,,,"Anderson, James B., ""A Generic DMA IP Core Interface for FPGA Platform Design"" filed Aug. 30, 2006, pp. 1-14, U.S. Appl.

Anderson, J. C. Aug. 29. Military bicycles.-The frame consists of a vertical rear fork A, an oblique front tube B, constituting a support for the saddle post, which is also the steering-post, and the stay tubes C, D. The driving-mechanism may be of the ordinary chain type, or consist of a rotatory shaft E connected to the crank axle and the rear-wheel hub by suitable gearing. The steering-wheel L is operated by the movement of the saddle P. A rectangular frame 1, 2, 3, 4, Fig. 2, is secured to the rear of the frame so as to constitute a rearward continuation of the hollow handle-bars F within which telescopic extensions G are housed. The extensions G are provided at their outer ends with rings or hooks a adapted to engage corresponding hooks on the cartridge belt of the rider, so that, when he dismounts, the extensions G are withdrawn from the housings and the machine may be trailed behind the rider. When in the extended position, the sections G may be locked by a slight rotatory motion. Other suitable folding or collapsable devices may be used. The knapsack L<1>, haversack M, &c. may be supported in the frame 1, 2, 3, 4 by straps c or hooks. A gun support, consisting of a buttrest I, a vertical arm J, and a spring clip K for gripping the gun stock, is attached to the steering. socket B. The steering-wheel is made small, so that the rider may grasp the gun and readily dismount. Another form of bicycle is described in which the larger wheel is used as the front wheel. The cranks are formed integral with internal gearwheels, centered behind the front-wheel axle, which engage pinions secured to the wheel hub. The gun is mounted horizontally in a spring support, which serves also as a mud guard. The gun may be raised to an approximately vertical position, and retained by a catch when the rider has dismounted.",ANDERSON JAMES CALDWELL,ANDERSON JAMES CALDWELL,,https://lens.org/054-579-438-908-705,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

A VCO is coupled to the electrodes for producing a variable frequency signal proportional to the resistance across the electrodes. A time base signal generator produces a relatively slow fixed frequency time base signal. A gate timer produces latch and reset signals from the time base signal for use in a BCD counter incorporating latch, multiplex and BCD counter portions. The resulting output from the BCD counter drives a display device to provide the user with a relative indication of the amount of moisture over a range of moistures in the feed product. Also disclosed are several types of probes. One flat plate type includes coaxially-mounted annular electrodes for measuring the moisture of newly cut hay.
