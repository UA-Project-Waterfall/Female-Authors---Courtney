Gauges.-The depth of water in a ship's bilge or ballast tank is ascertained by lowering vertically thereinto a graduated celluloid tube into which the water can flow through a non-return valve, so that when the tube is raised again the quantity of water in the tube indicates the depth. The celluloid tube c is mounted, by means of the hollow conical screwed plugs shown, within a framework formed by the upper and lower chambers a', e, to which a metal tube a with longitudinal slot b is screwed. The upper chamber is provided with apertures a<2> for the escape of water and air, while in the lower chamber there is a lift valve e<1> i, the spindle of which is attached to an external sliding casing g normally forced downwards by a spring so as to keep the valve shut. When the apparatus reaches the bottom of the tank, the casing rises, abutting against the flange e<3> and thereby excluding dirt, although the water can still pass to the open valve through small passages in the flange and the space between the casing and the lower chamber.",ADAMSON JAMES,ADAMSON JAMES,,https://lens.org/016-891-763-152-997,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The bulk of the lifting capacity is derived from a primary power source mechanically linked to the main lifting cable. As the source and destination positions move relative to each other, compensation for this motion is obtained via the coordinated reciprocal movement of an extensible connector, e.g. a wire rope and a lifting device mechanically linked between the main A-Frame and sub A-Frame, which is operative in response to sensory data input to the power unit's controller. The coordinated reciprocal motion acts to adjust the instantaneous load position thereby neutralizing the relative movement between the source position and destination position.

Counter-weighted pivot arms support the shutter at either end causing the center of rotation to pass through the center of gravity. The shutter has three basic positions: In the first position, during the winter day, the shutter closes off the northern face, allowing solar energy to enter directly into the supporting structure providing heat gain and daylighting. In the second position, during the winter night, the shutter closes off the open face to the interior, providing insulation between the structure and the skylight housing. In the third position, during the non-heating season, the shutter closes off the southern face blocking unwanted heat gain but allowing diffuse northern light to penetrate for daylighting.

A hole in the foil above each light source allows light to egress from the source(s) and radiate directly onto the surface of the sensitized media. The distance between the light source(s) and the media surface is controlled by the air-bearing flying height and the foil thickness. The size and shape of the spot of light at the media is controlled by the distance of the hole in the foil from the media and by the hole's size and shape. The write head is mounted to a rotor and as the rotor spins, the pivot arm allows centrifugal forces to move the head towards the media where it floats balanced by the air-bearing.",EASTMAN KODAK CO,FERENCE ROY BERNARD;;JADRICH BRADLEY STEPHEN;;ADAMSON STEVEN JAMES;;CONNOLLY JEREMIAH FINBARR,,https://lens.org/180-716-161-971-707,Patent Application,no,0,1,5,5,0,H04N1/036,B41J2/44;;B41J2/45;;B41J2/455;;H04N1/036,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Piercing the disc through the opening are two electrodes, the inner ends of which contact the sample within the flask and the outer ends of which afford connection of test equipment thereto. Cylindric glass tubes are fitted over the external portion of the electrodes to provide physical support therefor; silicone rubber or the like serves to retain the glass cylinders in place and form a gas tight seal between the cylinders and the electrodes. Shrinkable tubing is shrunk over the glass tubes to afford further mechanical support and sealing. A final relatively large diameter shrinkable tube is shrunk over both electrodes and their associated glass cylinders.

The reader 26 decodes a signal from the head 22 with reference to both a standard stripe card and a new card. The card is formed of a solid plastic material which contains magnetic particles, and the magnetic particles are composed of a high-coercive- force material such as barium iron, strontium iron or the like. Preferably, the density of the magnetic particles in the card is substantially in the range of 0.008 to 0.03volume%.
