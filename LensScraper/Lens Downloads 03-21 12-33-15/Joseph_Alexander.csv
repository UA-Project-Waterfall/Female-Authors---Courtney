As a safety feature, the ram advances only when the power button is activated, and retracts automatically when the power button is released. As a power-saving feature, the nutcracker automatically powers down when the ram reaches its forward or backward limit of motion.

Lamp signals; semaphore signals. - Electric incandescent lamps are placed in a semaphore arm, and exhibit a red or green light according to the position of the arm which may also be arranged to reverse its face when raised or lowered, the face presented when raised being red, and the reverse face white or green. The arm A, Fig. 1, carries lamps B, C of the straigh tfilament type, which are contained in semicircular reflector cases D, the beadings E of which contain the circuit wires. Platinum wires F support the filaments. The positive lead of lamp B is led to a contact-piece G, and that of the lamp C to a contact-piece H. When the arm is raised, the piece G makes contact with the piece 1 attached to the post K, thus illuminating the red lamp. When the arm is lowered, the green lamp is illuminated by the contact of the pieces J, H. The plungers L of spring buffers M prevent jars and limit the positions of the arm. A modification in which the arm has its faces reversed in moving is shown in Fig. 2. The spectacle casting is made in two pieces N, O, and the arm A is bolted to the piece O, the trunnion P of which is journaled in the casting N, and by means of the bevel-pinion R meshes with the rack S. Lamps B, C are placed on either side of the arm, and the positive lead of the red lamp B is connected to the piece G, which is normally situated immediately behind the strip H, and thus to the contact strip I. When the arm is lowered, the lead of the green lamp C connects through the piece H with the contact strip J. The contacts I, J arrest the movement without shock by their elasticity. In another form, the centre portion of the arm, with the lamps, alone rotates, a trunnion being provided at the outward end, and the outer part, of the arm acts as a frame ; or a single lamp with a case coloured half red and half green may be rotated in a central aperture, thus showing red or green according to the position of the arm. This lamp may be provided with a fixed reflector placed inside the glazed lamp casing. Rows of small lamps arranged in series may be used instead of the straight-filament lamp.",PANTON JOSEPH ALEXANDER,PANTON JOSEPH ALEXANDER,,https://lens.org/010-532-532-091-506,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The legs 4 are held-apart by an over-centre mechanism involving two struts 7 pivoted to the legs 4 and one another, and the resilience of the taut back-panel fabric 9 of the bag 2. A bottom panel of the bag 2 is strutted with rods 17 to stand out from the common plane of the legs 4 when they are splayed apart. Flexible-strand struts 26 strengthen the edges of side panels 15 to resist crumpling of the fabric when interlinked zip-fasteners on the front panel of the bag 2 are operated to open and close an access flap. A third leg 30 pivots in the housing 5 to form a tripod strut to support the inclined trolley. Collapse of the trolley (Figures 5 and 6) involves upward movement of the common pivot-point 8 of the struts 7, allowing the legs 4 to come together side-by-side with the leg 30, and the base panel 13 to fold with the front panel 18 overlying the side panels, on the legs 4. <IMAGE>",KALOGROULIS ALEXANDER JOSEPH,KALOGROULIS ALEXANDER JOSEPH,,https://lens.org/032-842-831-816-740,Patent Application,no,2,1,2,3,0,B62B1/12,B62B1/12,B7B BTF2          BTF2;;B7B B367          BTF2,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

In ball bonding, the wire is fed through and protrudes from a capillary hole in a bonding head, an electric arc melts the protruding wire into a ball, the solid ball thus formed is pressed and flattened onto the contact pad by the bonding head and the ball-contact surface interface is subjected to ultrasonic vibrations to form a bond between the flattened ball and the contact pad. Aluminum wire has presented a problem in forming asym­metric, porous, faceted balls that ball-bond very poorly. By using an aluminum wire coated with an electrically insulating layer that melts above the melting tempera­ture of aluminum and has an electrical resistance suf­ficient to prevent the electric arc from shifting up the wire and away from the tip, the problem of poor quality balls is solved and a round, axisymmetric ball is formed which ball-bonds consistently well.

Bottle necks, making. -Relates to machines for forming the necks of glass bottles. The interior of the neck is shaped by a pair of longitudinal rolls e united by a head f and carried by the mandrel c. The exterior is shaped by rolls j mounted on slides i guided in grooves in a disc h which forms the end of a hollow shaft g secured upon the mandrel c. The rolls are moved inwards to shape the neck by the action of the cam w, lever u, pin u<1>, sleeve m, yielding links n, and levers k. Towards the close of the forward movement of the sleeve m it comes in contact with the collar r, and pushes forward the sleeve q, the end of which serves to curl up the front end of the bottle lip. The cam w is driven by the toothed wheel y only when the treadle 17 is depressed, and the clutch y' is thrown out of operation automatically at the end of each revolution. Fig. 2 shows the clutch mechanism in section. The rod 13 is formed with two camsurfaces at its upper end. When the rod is depressed, the upper surface comes into the path of the detent 11, causing it to move radially outwards so as to release the spring-pressed dog 7, which enters a recess in the collar 9 and sets the shaft 1 in motion. At the end of one revolution the dog 7 is pressed back by the lower cam surface, the rod 13 having been previously released, and is retained by the detent 11, the shaft 1 then coming to rest.",RUDOLPH ALEXANDER JOSEPH,RUDOLPH ALEXANDER JOSEPH,,https://lens.org/060-905-279-755-534,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

WESTERN MANUFACTURING ESTATE, Ltd. Aug. 15, 1947, No. 22682. [Class 7 (vi)] [Also in Group XXXIII] An engine control mechanism comprises an operator's control member movable to and fro on each side of a minimum power position and connected to a driven member controlling the , engine speed and/or power, alternative connections being provided between the two members and including toothed reversing gearing which, when rendered operative, reverses the sense of movement between the two members, and means displaceable between alternative positions in which it prevents and permits movement of the operator's control member past the minimum power position, and operable, on such displacement, to reverse the connections between the two members, the said means being operated with the reversing control so that after operation of the latter, movement of the operator's control member in the direction normally reducing engine speed and/or power now results in an increase thereof. The invention is shown applied to an aircraft fitted with reversible-pitch braking propellers, the engine throttle control comprising a lever 5 pivoted at 6 and provided with a quadrant 4 meshing with a second quadrant 2 carried by a drum 1 connected by cables, or the like, to the engine throttle. Normally the drum 1 and lever 5 are locked together, as shown in Fig. 1, a pin 10 carried by a spring-loaded latch lever 8 engaging with a recess 11 in the end of a lever 7 rotatably mounted on the drum shaft 20. Rearward movement of the lever 5 beyond the throttle-closed position is prevented by a lever 14 which obstructs a lobe 19 of the drum 1. Upon reversal of propeller pitch the release lever 14 is actuated automatically, whereby a curved portion 16 engages the pin 10 and lifts it from. the recess 11 in the end of the lever 7, as shown in Fig. 3, and at the same time a hook 17 engages a locking pin 6 on the lever 7, thus preventing movement of the latter. Rearward movement of the lever 5 can then occur, the gearing 2, 4 being operative to effect opening of the engine throttle during such rearward movement of the lever.",WESTERN MFG ESTATE LTD,BOULGER JOSEPH ALEXANDER,,https://lens.org/043-822-183-192-925,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B63H3/10;;B64C11/30,B63H3/10;;B64C11/30,B7G GCTT          CTT;;B7V VHC           VHC;;F1B BBC           BC20;;F1B BB120         BC20;;F1B BB150         BC20;;F1B BB212         BC20;;F1B BB222         BC20;;F2Y YST           ST;;F2Y Y3111         ST,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In ball bonding, the wire is fed through and protrudes from a capillary hole in a bonding head, an electric arc melts the protruding wire into a ball, the solid ball thus formed is pressed and flattened onto the contact pad by the bonding head and the ball-contact surface interface is subjected to ultrasonic vibrations to form a bond between the flattened ball and the contact pad. Aluminum wire has presented a problem in forming asym­metric, porous, faceted balls that ball-bond very poorly. By using an aluminum wire coated with an electrically insulating layer that melts above the melting tempera­ture of aluminum and has an electrical resistance suf­ficient to prevent the electric arc from shifting up the wire and away from the tip, the problem of poor quality balls is solved and a round, axisymmetric ball is formed which ball-bonds consistently well.

The systems and methods described herein may be specifically well suited for separating solids, hydrocarbons, chemicals, non-evaporable components, etc., from wastewater produced by oil and gas recovery. The systems and methods may generally include the use of a heat exchanger through which a fluid stream is passed to thereby evaporate some or all of the fluid stream. The heated stream exiting the heat exchanger may include vapor, liquids and/or solids. This heated stream is then subjected to phase separation to separate a vapor stream from a liquid/solids stream. The vapor stream is then transported back to the heat exchanger where it is used to transfer heat from the vapor stream to the fluid stream. During the operation of the heat exchanger, a scraping system may be used to scrape the one or more surfaces of the passage through which the fluid stream flows in order to prevent buildup of solids and liquids thereon.",CIRCLE VERDE WATER CORP,ALEXANDER JOSEPH V,CIRCLE VERDE WATER CORPORATION (2022-11-17),https://lens.org/128-431-931-834-748,Granted Patent,yes,27,0,1,1,0,B01D53/326;;B01D53/002;;B01D1/225;;B01D3/346;;C02F2103/365;;C02F2101/32;;C02F1/048;;C02F1/042;;C02F2103/10;;C02F1/20;;C02F1/461;;C02F9/00;;C02F1/32;;C02F1/72;;C02F1/004;;C02F1/66;;B01D1/225;;C02F1/042;;C02F1/048;;C02F1/26;;B01D1/0047;;C02F2103/10;;B01D53/326;;B01D53/76;;C02F2303/10;;C02F2101/32;;B01D1/2818,B01D1/22;;B01D1/00;;B01D1/28;;B01D53/32;;B01D53/76;;C02F1/04;;C02F1/26;;C02F101/32;;C02F103/10,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

   Whereas the technical revolution surrounding the use of the internet as a trading medium has not to date, included the use of the internet for the trading of the commodity known as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) in either the physical commodity form, nor as futures and options trading of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), I believe that this business method should be protected. 

   I believe that the utilization of an internet based electronic exchange utilized for the purposes of trading the physical commodity known as LNG and futures and options contracts of LNG will serve to enhance the liquidity in the market fueling the growth of this environmentally sound feedstock for power generation the world over.

Danischevski, J., and Meissner, A. Nov. 19. Vapour burners.-Relates mainly to incandescent and other burners for lighting or heating purposes, and to means for supplying petroleum thereto at a constant pressure. This pressure may be obtained by means of a piston working in a tubular reservoir, or by means of a weight P or P<1> acting on a flexible reservoir a. The filling of the flexible reservoir is effected by extending the reservoir by raising, by means of the handle k and the pinion e, a rack attached to the top of the reservoir, the partial vaccum thus created causing the oil to flow from a supply tank through a detachable flexible tube t into the reservoir. The burner comprises a single supply chamber U<3> and a single superheater U<4> connected by two parallel, concentric, or other vaporizing-tubes U', which contain bundles of wires wound spirally and covered with a layer of asbestos and are provided with separate valves z, so that they may be used independently, the one serving to supply the burner while the other is being burnt out or cleaned. Arranged in the superheater U<4> is a thermostatic blade r carrying at its free end a needle or valve r<1>. So long as the burner is alight, the heat causes the blade r to lift the needle r' clear of the orifice s, but as soon as the flame is extinguished and the parts cool, the blade r forces the needle r<1> into the orifice, which is thereby automatically cleaned and closed. To start the lamp, the vaporizing-tubes are initially heated in the usual manner, and the spring pawl f is released by means of handle g so that the weight can act upon the flexible reservoir. To extinguish the lamp without smoke or the exhalation of vapours, the weight P or P' is raised by rotating the handle k. The partial vacuum created causes all the liquid combustible in the vaporizing- tubes to flow back through the tube w into the reservoir A. A portable lamp is described, in which a spring, instead of a weight, is employed for compressing the flexible reservoir.",DANISCHEVSKI JOSEPH;;MEISSNER ALEXANDER,DANISCHEVSKI JOSEPH;;MEISSNER ALEXANDER,,https://lens.org/107-738-700-215-792,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The adhesive is allowed to cure and bond both the stretch- free material and the flexible abrasive member, thereby providing a material with a backing which withstands heat generated by friction against materials to be abraded. <IMAGE>",LAZAR JOSEPH;;SCHWARTZ ALEXANDER,LAZAR JOSEPH;;SCHWARTZ ALEXANDER,,https://lens.org/173-931-326-577-061,Patent Application,no,2,8,3,3,0,B24D11/00,B24D11/00,C4V V1            V1;;C4V V130          V1;;C4V V210          V1;;C4V V240          V1;;C4V V250          V1;;C4V V255          V1,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

J., and Muirhead, A. Dec. 7. Telegraphs.-Relates primarily to a portable set of apparatus for wireless telegraphy, though the invention may be applied to a stationary set. Referring to Fig. 1, a dynamo a as a source of electrical energy is used in conjunction with an induction coil b, having an interrupter c with a condenser d in parallel with it, and a key e is placed in the primary circuit of the induction coil. Electric valves or rectifiers j, k of the vacuum or vapour class are placed between the secondary circuit g and the aerials h, i, and a condenser m may be connected across the spark-gap. In operation, the induced currents in the circuit g are transmitted through the valves j, k, (positive pulses passing through the series j and negative pulses through series k), to the aerials h, i, until the potential difference breaks down the resistance at the spark-gap l. In a modification, only one series of rectifiers or only one rectifier is used, and a battery may be substituted for the dynamo. A telephone o, Fig. 3, is employed as a receiver, and a coherer p is placed in the secondary circuit r of the transformer, the primary of which is inserted between the aerials t, u, a condenser v being used to increase the capacity of the coherer. A condenser w is placed across the receiving instrument as described in Specification No. 18,644, A.D. 1897. The coherer may be a modification of the type described in Specification No. 13,521, A.D. 1902, comprising a trough y containing mercury having a layer of insulating fluid above it, and a needle z, Fig. 4, attached to an arm 2 pivoted at 3 to the frame 4 of clock-work mechanism 1 and caused to vibrate by a link 5 connected to a cam 6 driven by mechanism 1, but any other suitable type may be employed. In packing the apparatus for transport, the transmitting and receiving circuits are enclosed in cases 7, 8 which are placed for use on a trestle 9, and the cases are divided into compartments closed by suitable doors and covers, as shown in Fig. 7, in which 30 denotes the transformer, 31 the key conveniently attached to the door 20,32 the rectifiers, 33 the spark-gap, 34 the coherer, 35 the telephone supported on door 22 when not in use, 36 the transformer for the receiving circuit, 37 a device for testing the coherer, and 38 the main switch.

Aug. 11. Wireless telegraphy.-Relates to a system of signalling by Hertzian radiations in which the sending and receiving stations are provided with raised surface plates or are connected by bare or uninsulated wires ; wires terminating in surface plates may be employed for part of the distance. Each station is equipped for transmitting and receiving, the line connection being charged by a switch l, which is preferably provided with earth and line contacts and means for short-circuiting the coherer when not in use. Single or double spark gaps j may be employed. Several single-contact or other coherers may be arranged in parallel, the springs being brought together so as to be operated in sequence by a rotating cam. A coherer may be formed of filings placed on a partially-varnished plate situated over a magnet, and covered by a second spring- supported plate resting on the filings. The coherer may be arranged in one arm of a Wheatstone bridge, the second arm on the same side having a decohering-electromagnet. The other two arms of the bridge are formed of resistances, the battery being arranged across one axis while the receiver is across the other. Fig. 4 shows the coherer c shunted by two other circuits containing the receiver a and a condenser n, and also the battery b, and an adjustable resistance q. The coherer may be arranged in series with the battery and receiver, these being shunted by a condenser, or the receiver may be in the secondary circuit of an induction coil, the primary of which is in series with the coherer and battery. When syntonized circuits are employed, the battery and receiver circuit are attached at the centre point so as not to affect the balance.

The spindle 10 is locked in its forward ball-engaging position by a pin 11 held by the locking ring 15 until the latter is moved forwardly against a spring 16 on expansion of the sponge 17. Manual retraction of the spindle 10 is effected by pulling a handle 19 which has a perforated end cover plate 20 to provide access for water.

   A method of assembling a motor comprising assembling the shaft and thrust plate to be used in the fluid dynamic bearing assembly, and at least partially inserting the combined shaft and thrust plate into a sleeve which is adapted to support a hub which in turn may support one or more disks for rotation in a disc drive or similar environment. A counterplate cup of a generally U shaped or cup shaped design including a base which is substantially parallel to a top surface of the thrust plate, and sides of a diameter which is slightly greater than the diameter of the thrust plate and which are parallel to the thrust plate is provided, filled with oil, and having its open end facing the thrust plate.

    A method of assembling a motor comprising assembling the shaft and thrust plate to be used in the fluid dynamic bearing assembly, and at least partially inserting the combined shaft and thrust plate into a sleeve which is adapted to support a hub which in turn may support one or more disks for rotation in a disc drive or similar environment. A counterplate cup of a generally U shaped or cup shaped design including a base which is substantially parallel to a top surface of the thrust plate, and sides of a diameter which is slightly greater than the diameter of the thrust plate and which are parallel to the thrust plate is provided, filled with oil, and having its open end facing the thrust plate. Next the shaft and hub are pressed with the counterplate cup, the counterplate cup being pressed down over the end of the thrust plate so that the upraised sides of the cup fit easily over the ends of the thrust plate and can be pressed fit tightly over the upraised outer surface of the sleeve, tightly fitting the inside of the counterplate cup over the outside surface of the sleeve. During this press fit, the oil is pushed out of the region between the thrust plate upper surface and the counterplate cup bottom surface, and as the upraised sides of the cup fit over the outside of the sleeve, the oil fills the section between the lower surface of the thrust plate and the upper surface of the sleeve as well as the gap between the shaft and the surrounding sleeve.

July 10 Wireless telegraphy.-A receiving-apparatus for Hertzian-wave signalling consists of a coherer c arranged in circuit with the receiving-instrument, shown as a siphon recorder a with means for causing the coherer to decohere. The coherer, as shown, consists of a metal spring secured at one end and having two adjustment screws, one of which produces the active contact. The coil d of the recorder is shown attached by a fibre p to the coherer to restore it to its normal state. The coherer may also be acted upon directly by a magnet, by a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field, by an oscillating toothed segment, or by a skew cam as described in Specification No. 11,069, A.D. 1894, [Abridgment Class Electric telegraphs &c.], acting on an extension of the coherer spring. When a filing-coherer is employed, it may be carried by the armature of a magnet in the local circuit. The following modifications are described in the Provisional Specification. Filing- coherers disturbed by the motion of a needle or moving-coil receiving-instrument may be used. A coherer having a mercury contact and a spiral surrounded by a helix of or containing iron may be used. A brush rubbing against a revolving drum may also be used as a coherer. As a decoherer, a rod immersed in the filings and actuated by external means may be employed. As a wave emitter, two spheres or ellipsoids may be employed, one having a depression containing oil, and the other a projection dipping therein. When automatic transmission is employed, the contacts caused by the perforations close the primary of the induction coil, the vibrating hammer being preferably kept in movement by an independent motor. As a system of relaying, the coherer circuit at an intermediate point can cause an induction coil to re-emit the signals received by the coherer.",LODGE OLIVER JOSEPH;;MUIRHEAD ALEXANDER,LODGE OLIVER JOSEPH;;MUIRHEAD ALEXANDER,,https://lens.org/194-323-770-638-02X,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Each bit slice is comprised of a master-slave flip-flop (a master latch circuit and a slave latch circuit) and an output control network which is driven by the flip-flop. Each of the latch circuits and the output control network comprises a single stage (unit propagation delay), two decision level cascode ECL circuit. The output control network selectively supplies either the Q or the Q output signal from the flip-flop or a logic zero signal to the network's output terminal (designated P). The control network responds to applied select (S) and enable (E) signals so that when the S signal is at a high level (logic 1) and the E signal is at a low level (logic zero) the Q signal is fed to the P output terminal; when the E and S signals are both at a low level, the Q signal is fed to the P output terminal; and when the E signal is at a high level the signal at the P output terminal is held at the low (logic zero) level. This just described enable feature of the invention allows for ""wire-OR"" connection of the P output terminal from a given ECL circuit to the output terminals of other ECL circuits so as to facilitate the implementation of a variety of processor circuits, such as, for example, toggle/hold circuits, expandable counters, J-K flip-flops and shift registers.",HUGHES AIRCRAFT CO,STRAZNICKY JOSEPH;;KUMJIAN ALEXANDER A,,https://lens.org/044-571-430-078-293,Granted Patent,yes,3,13,1,1,0,H03K3/289;;H03K3/289,H03K3/289,307221R,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Another form shown in Fig. 3 has the level mounted in an arm 5 adapted to be adjusted in an horizontal position by a screw 7, the end of the arm passing over a graduated scale 10 in a vertical direction. The distance gauge 2 in both cases is provided with a series of points or knife edges 4 to cut through any deposit of dirt on the rails and so enable a correct reading to be obtained. In the case of tram rails, lugs are provided to engage the grooves in the rails.",PANTON JOSEPH ALEXANDER;;MCCOLLOUGH PHELAM,PANTON JOSEPH ALEXANDER;;MCCOLLOUGH PHELAM,,https://lens.org/102-985-670-211-294,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

May 2. Wireless telegraphy. - Relates to a system of syntonic telegraphy such as described in Specification No. 11,575, A.D. 1897, including the arrangements of the circuits for transmitting and receiving, including automatic and duplex working. Fig. 1 shows one arrangement of transmitter in which condensers c, d, separated by an inductance e, are connected between the aerial and earth capacities a, b. The spark gap f may be variously placed in the series, or may be arranged in a condenser shunt, or in a local tuned Tesla circuit. Adjustable condensers, such as described in Specification No. 29,069, A.D. 1897, may be employed, Fig. 10 shows the arrangement of the coherer circuit in inductive relation to the aerial conductor a, or directly connected to it through a condenser. For automatic transmission, two pairs of magnets are arranged with their magnet coils and armature contacts cross-connected, so as to produce a series of makes and breaks, the armature of one pair of magnets being made to operate a pivoted contact-lever closing and opening the primary of the induction coil. The contactneedles are set slightly out of line, so that, with double perforations, the tape produces a short train of waves for a dot &c. and a longer train for a dash. In duplex working, the homo transmitting aerial conductor is situated to one side of the plane containing two receiving aerial conductors, one of which may be tilted so as to produce a neutralizing effect. The receiving-apparatus is preferably enclosed in a screen casing, and the circuits may be figure-of-eighted. The Provisional Specification refers to the use of coherers such as described in Specification No. 11,348, A.D. 1901. Decoherence is obtained by using the vibrating contact-plate of the cable relay described in Specification No. 3343, A.D. 1900, [Abridgment Class Electric telegraphs &c.], and bringing the coherer, or an arm attached thereto, near to the contact-plate. A second recorder coil may be connected by fibres to the coherer apparatus to regulate its position.",LODGE OLIVER JOSEPH;;MUIRHEAD ALEXANDER,LODGE OLIVER JOSEPH;;MUIRHEAD ALEXANDER,,https://lens.org/194-264-616-823-860,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Lodge, Sir O. J., and Muirhead, A. Oct. 12. Telegraphs.-Relates to the transmission of signals through submarine and like cables by means of inductive current surges of high electromotive force, the signals being curbed by current surges of opposite sign. Either hand or automatic sending instruments may be used. In the arrangement shown in Fig. 1, current flows continuously through the circuit g, which includes the inductance coils b, c. The cable and earth connections are made at points of equal potential. When the circuit g is broken by the depression of the key i the coil b sends a current surge to line followed by a steady current of much lower electromotive force. The steady current may be used in signalling to produce a long "" dash "" instead of a succession of "" dots."" When the key i rises, a second surge effects the curbing of the signal. The opposite signal is sent by the key h. The keys may be depressed by the armatures of electromagnets controlled by an automatic transmitter. The coils b, c may be placed close together, the surge from each coil being aided by the mutual induction from the other. Fig. 3 shows a modified arrangement in which there is no appreciable ""follow on"" current into the cable. The inductance coils v, w are in this case arranged in parallel circuits. Instead of connecting the cable and earth, as shown in Fig. 3, the cable may be connected to earth through a coil possessing mutual induction with the coils v, w. Fig. 4 shows another arrangement in which the batteries 1, 2 are in opposition, each supplying current to one of the coils 5, 6. Condensers 7, 8 with shunts 9, 10 are used to prevent sparking at the keys. In this case, also, the cable may be connected to earth through a coil possessing mutual induction with the coils 5, 6. In a modification based on that shown in Fig. 1, a coil of large self induction is bridged across the circuit g between cable and earth. It acts as an obstacle to sudden surges, directing them into the cable, but it allows earth currents &c.to pass. Any of the above arrangements may be used in connection with the known systems of duplex telegraphy.",LODGE OLIVER JOSEPH;;MUIRHEAD ALEXANDER,LODGE OLIVER JOSEPH;;MUIRHEAD ALEXANDER,,https://lens.org/148-316-311-154-006,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

L., Davidson, A., and Perryman, N. J. April 2, 1917 Receiving and repeating systems.-Block signals are broken up into their constituent elements by means of relays caused to vibrate automatically when signals are received. In the arrangement shown in Fig. 1, separate vibrating relays V, V<1> are used for dots and dashes, each relay being provided with differential windings 1, 2 connected respectively through a resistance R<1> and condenser K or inductance to a repeating-relay P and the middle point of a battery B, the ends of which are connected to the contacts 3, 4 of the relay tongue 5, which is connected through a resistance R<2> to the junction of the differential windings. Owing to the action of one winding being varied relatively to that of the other bv the condenser or inductance, the relays tend to vibrate automatically to indicate dots and dashes respectively, this vibration being prevented, except when dots and dashes are received, by controlling windings 7, the circuits of which are opened by a double relay D controlled by the cable relay A. If it is desired to work a perforator, it is necessary to distinguish between letter and word spacing, and for this purpose a spacing relay may be added which commences to vibrate directly the dots and dashes cease and is timed to give one impulse to the spacing key of the perforator for each centre hole of the transmitting- tape during which no signals are sent. Two arrangements for this purpose are described. Instead of providing auxiliary or controlling windings to stop the operation of the vibrating relays as required, the circuit through one or both of the operating windings of these relays may be broken. Instead of employing two separate vibrating relays for dots and dashes, a single vibrating relay may be used for causing two repeating relays to vibrate, a third relay det-ermining which of the repeating relays is connected in circuit. The Provisional Specification states that the invention may be used in quadruplex working in which it is necessary to distinguish between signals of varying amplitude and duration.",DEARLOVE JOSEPH ARTHUR LOVEL;;DAVIDSON ALEXANDER;;PERRYMAN NELSON JOSEPH,DEARLOVE JOSEPH ARTHUR LOVEL;;DAVIDSON ALEXANDER;;PERRYMAN NELSON JOSEPH,,https://lens.org/012-448-000-067-565,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H04L25/205,H04L25/20,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
