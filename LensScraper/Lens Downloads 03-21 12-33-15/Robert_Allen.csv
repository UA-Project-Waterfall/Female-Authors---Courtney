Sept. 19. Pistons; piston packing.-In order to adapt segmental packing-rings expanded by lateral springs or plungers, as described in Specification 11,480/13, to pistons without removable junk rings or plates, the springs are contained in a segmental housing- ring made of a light metal, such as aluminium or aluminium alloy. Fig. 1 shows a segmental packing-ring c expanded by plungers f acted on by springs e contained in a segmental housing-ring d. The latter ring is formed with a tongue g, which enters a recess in the wall of the groove. Rotation of the ring d may be prevented by a pin secured in the piston and entering a notch in the ring. Holes j may be formed in the piston to permit the escape of oil from the groove. The wedges i, Fig. 6, between the ends of the segments of the packing- ring are also acted on by spring plungers. The bevelled surfaces of the wedges may be cut away, as shown by dotted lines. In the modification shown in Fig. 7, the housing-ring is formed with flanges which enter recesses g<1>, g<2> in the packing- ring groove. The sockets for the springs e may be formed separately and secured in the ring d. Fig. 11 shows the employment of axial springs and plungers e, f contained in recesses in a tread ring d and acting on segmental expanding rings l, which are held in position by projections f<1> on the plungers. Alternatively, separate springs e may be employed for the two packing-rings c, the recesses on one side of the ring d being out of line with those in the other side of the ring.

[Cognate Applications, 8535/11 and 11,790/11.] Piston packing. - Undue expansion of segmental piston packing by the working fluid is prevented either by friction between the packing and the side of its groove, or by excluding working fluid from the back of the packing. Packing - rings may be pressed axially and radially by inclined springs, and grit may be collected by grooved rings. In the arrangements shown in Figs. 1 and 2, segments a are pressed outwards by wedges b acted on by helical springs c. The grooves d are wider than the packing-rings, which are pressed against one side of a groove by the fluid pressure and by springs g. The wearing-surfaces of the rings are reduced, either by being cut away, as shown, or by means of grooves. The springs g may be replaced by projections on the segments, which hold the rings away from one side of a groove. This arrangement may be modified by arranging the springs g to press the packing-rings against the high-pressure side of a groove, thus excluding pressure fluid from the back of the packing. In a modified arrangement, grooves are dispensed with, the packing-rings being arranged at the sides of a carrier, and guided by studs passing through slots in the packing-rings. In the arrangement shown in Figs. 7 and 8, the packing-rings are arranged between non- expanding rings m and a carrier. The carrier is formed in halves secured together, and having either overlapping ends or butt ends and coverplates e<7> secured by pegs e<5>, which may be withdrawn by means of studs inserted through holes r<1>. Where necessary, the rings m are also formed in halves secured together. The wedges b are expanded by leaf springs c<1> formed with heads c<2> dovetailed into the wedges. Fig. 10 shows a ring m in two parts, which are prevented from expanding and rotating by pegs m<2>, and are acted on by leaf springs n. Fig. 22 shows the segments a and the wedges pressed both radially and axially by inclined springs g<3>. Some of the cups h slide in grooves h<1> to prevent rotation. The piston of an internal-combustion engine is provided with one or more grooved rings t, Fig. 26. Grit collecting in the grooves passes through holes t<3> to the backs of the rings. The rings may be in parts secured to the piston by studs t<4>.

Pistons.-To take up the wear of the piston of a horizontal cylinder, an adjustable centring-ring, separate from the packing, is mounted on the piston. The ring a is housed between a junk ring and a flange on the piston, and is formed with a number of in. clined surfaces p, with which wedges o, o<1> are adapted to engage. These wedges are moved either by right and left band screwthreads on crosspins, or by screwing the hollow bolts q<3> into one of each pair of the wedges, the bolts q<2> passing through the hollow bolts and screwing into the other wedges ; the two bolts are connected together by a pin r so as to move simultaneously. A pin p<2> prevents rotation of the centring-ring. When the piston is formed without a junk ring, the centring- ring is in two parts bolted together by plates a<1>. The wedges are situated at the bottom of the piston, but the ring is provided with inclined surfaces around its circumferences to permit displace. ment for taking up the wear on the ring. In place of the wedges, thin plates inserted between the ring and piston body may be used to adjust the ring.

A central tube k is screwed at one end to a flanged steel nut f in the base, and at the other end to a nose j. The tube k, which is perforated, may form a priming tube, or in large shells may contain part of the explosive charge and have a priming tube within it. Instead of a single tubular bolt k, several concentric bolts may in some cases be provided. A shrapnel shell is described in which the central tube screws directly into the head and base, separate nuts being dispensed with. An armour-piercing shell is shown in Fig. 4, comprising a steel nose m integral with a bolt k which is screwed into a nut f in the base. The head h may be centred on the upper end of the body a by a ring o having an annular rib fitting an internal groove in the joint. Dowel pins n are inserted in the joints between the body and the head and base respectively. In another construction, a V-groove is provided in the base for receiving the tapered end of the body portion. In all cases, malleable metal collars or washers are provided in the joints to render them gas-tight and absorb shock. An outer winding of high-tensile steel wire q or the like may be provided on the shell body, Fig. 6. The wire is preferably wound on when red hot, and the ends may be welded. Several methods of securing the copper driving-band c are described, two of which are shown in Figs. 1 and 4, where copper or other fixing-pins are shown. The groove for the band may be serrated at the sides, or the bottom of the groove may be ribbed. The band is preferably shrunk on.

Solutions containing a haloperoxidase (i.e., a halide:hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) oxidoreductase, such as myeloperoxidase, eosinophil peroxidase or lactoperoxidase) plus a halide or combination of halides (i.e., chloride, bromide and/or iodide), an oxidase (i.e., a substrate:O2 oxidoreductase) capable of generating H2O2, and a substrate specific for that oxidase, are separately prepared under aerobic conditions, but all of the component solutions are made anaerobic prior to final combination and mixing. The anaerobic formulations are dispensed into containers capable of maintaining the anaerobic condition (e.g., pressurized canisters). Dispensing the solution at the time of use exposes the formulation to air (i.e., O2) which activates its disinfectant-sterilent properties. O2 is the rate limiting component for oxidase generation of H2O2. Under aerobic conditions the oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of its substrate and the reduction of O2 to generate H2O2. In turn, H2O2 serves as substrate for haloperoxidase which catalyzes the oxidation of halide to hypohalous acid. Hypohalous acid reacts with an additional H2O2 to generate singlet molecular oxygen (1O2). Hypohalous acid (e.g., hypochlorous acid) and especially 1O2 are potent microbicidal agents. Both haloperoxidase generation of hypohalous acid and its reactive consumption to yield 1O2 are dependent on the availability of H2O2. A high rate of H2O2 generation does not result in the accumulation of hypohalous acid, but instead results in a high rate of 1O2 production. The microbicidal capacity and toxicity of 1O2 are limited by the half-life of this metastable electronically excited reactant, and as such, disinfectant-sterilent activity is temporally defined by and confined to the dynamics of oxidant generation. The disinfectant-sterilent activity of formulation requires air exposure and is dependent on the presence of the halide-haloperoxidase combination employed, the activity of the oxidase present, the availability of oxidase-specific substrate and the availability of O2.",EXOXEMIS INC,ALLEN ROBERT C,"EXOXEMIS, INC.

The new acid optimum chemiluminescent indicator system comprises haloperoxidase (halide:hydrogen peroxide oxidoreductase), halide, oxidant and chemiluminigenic substrate. The indicator system acts as a synthesizer of highly reactive singlet molecular oxygen (<1>O2), which reacts with the chemiluminigenic substrate to yield an excited state, oxidized reaction product. The excited state reaction product then relaxes to a lower energy (e.g., ground) state with the emission of measurable light in an amount related to the amount of each of the reaction participants present in a reaction solution. Known, non-rate limiting amounts of three of the reaction participants are provided in an assay solution to determine the presence or amount of the fourth participant in a test sample. The fourth participant in the test sample may be the analyte of interest, or may be produced or consumed in the test sample through one or more preliminary reactions involving the ultimate analyte of interest, with the amount of the fourth participant being related to the amount of analyte in the test solution. Accordingly, the indicator system of the invention may be employed for the determination of a wide variety of analytes. The indicator system operates most efficiently over the range from acid to slightly basic pH, e.g., at a pH of about 3 to about 8. Also described is a variety of illustrative assay formats in which the indicator reaction of the invention may be employed, as well as kits for use in carrying out assays utilizing the haloperoxidase/halide/oxidant/substrate indicator system.",EXOXEMIS INC,ALLEN ROBERT CHARLES,,https://lens.org/106-391-158-047-357,Granted Patent,no,0,0,16,16,0,C12Q1/28;;C12Q1/28,C12Q1/28,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

MARCONI'S WIRELESS TELEGRAPH CO. Ltd. Jan. 24, 1958 [March 26, 1957], No. 9846/57. Class 40 (1). A torque-meter comprises a shaft on which an odd number of at least three metal rotors are insulatedly mounted, each rotor having lateral projections the surfaces of which form, with the co-operating surfaces of the projections on adjacent rotors, capacitors whose values vary when the rotors are differentially rotated by torsional strain in the shaft, and fixed electrodes are provided which are capacity coupled with the central rotor and the two outer rotors to act as capacity slip-rings. As shown, Fig. 1, two outer rotors a and a central rotor b are mounted on hubs c, d, of insulating material which are precisely located on the shaft by being attached to radial projections e integral with the shaft. The lateral projections of the central rotor have flat surfaces g spaced from similar surfaces of adjacent outer rotor projections by gaps h, i, which are equal when the shaft is unstrained and the widths of which vary in opposite senses when a torque is applied to the shaft. Pairs of ring electrodes k, insulatedly fixed to the housing l, co-operate with an annular projection j on each rotor to provide fixed capacity coupling. Fig. 3 shows an A.C. energized measuring bridge in which variable capacitors q<SP>1</SP>, r<SP>1</SP> represent the capacitances between the lateral projections on the central rotor and those on the two outer rotors respectively, capacitors o<SP>1</SP>, n<SP>1</SP>, p<SP>1</SP>, are formed by the ring electrodes and the annular projections on the central rotor and the two outer rotors respectively, and s, t are ordinary variable capacitors.

    Methods and compositions are disclosed for producing air-activated, i.e., oxygen (O _{ 2 } ) activated, disinfectant-sterilent solutions. Solutions containing a haloperoxidase (i.e., a halide:hydrogen peroxide (H _{ 2 } O _{ 2 } ) oxidoreductase, such as myeloperoxidase, eosinophil peroxidase or lactoperoxidase) plus a halide or combination of halides (i.e., chloride, bromide and/or iodide), an oxidase (i.e., a substrate:O _{ 2 } oxidoreductase) capable of generating H _{ 2 } O _{ 2 } , and a substrate specific for that oxidase, are separately prepared under aerobic conditions, but all of the component solutions are made anaerobic prior to final combination and mixing. The anaerobic formulations are dispensed into containers capable of maintaining the anaerobic condition (e.g., pressurized canisters). Dispensing the solution at the time of use exposes the formulation to air (i.e., O _{ 2 } ) which activates its disinfectant-sterilent properties. O _{ 2 } is the rate limiting component for oxidase generation of H _{ 2 } O _{ 2 } . Under aerobic conditions the oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of its substrate and the reduction of O _{ 2 } to generate H _{ 2 } O _{ 2 } . In turn, H _{ 2 } O _{ 2 } serves as substrate for haloperoxidase which catalyzes the oxidation of halide to hypohalous acid. Hypohalous acid reacts with an additional H _{ 2 } O _{ 2 } to generate singlet molecular oxygen ( _{ 1 } O _{ 2 } ). Hypohalous acid (e.g., hypochiorous acid) and especially ^{ 1 } O _{ 2 } are potent microbicidal agents. Both haloperoxidase generation of hypohalous acid and its reactive consumption to yield ^{ 1 } O _{ 2 } are dependent on the availability of H _{ 2 } O _{ 2 } . A high rate of H _{ 2 } O _{ 2 } generation does not result in the accumulation of hypohalous acid, but instead results in a high rate of ^{ 1 } O _{ 2 } production. The microbicidal capacity and toxicity of ^{ 1 } O _{ 2 } are limited by the half-life of this metastable electronically excited reactant, and as such, disinfectant-sterilent activity is temporally defined by and confined to the dynamics of oxidant generation.

These systems have the features of determining control signals to control the output steam to a turbine. An offset value 250 is determined from a first measurement, first temperature Ta, of a first superheater section and a second measurement, second temperature Tb, of a second super heater section. An output measurement Tf is also generated using the first and second measurements. This output measurement is compared with a setpoint 233 which can be from a dynamic matrix control block. This creates a first Vatemp and second Vb control signal which controls field devices 210, 211 associated with the first and second measurement variables.

In one embodiment the anvil 14 is hemispherical and is positioned in a hemispherical recess formed in a conductive bed 11. Fluid is supplied to the recess via a plurality of apertures 13 communicating with a source of pressurized fluid by way of an annular chamber 13a. The tool 15 is in the form of a welding electrode connected to one side of the current supply and carried by a support frame (not shown) attached to the bed 11 and electrically insulated from it. The bed 11 is connected to the other side of the current supply. Pressure upon the electrode will cause the anvil 14 to move should there be any misalignment, and increased pressure together with a control of the fluid pressure causes the fluid film to collapse so that the anvil 14 makes contact with the bed 11 and a current is passed for welding to be initiated. The tool 15 may alternatively comprise a cold welding tool or an ultrasonic welding tool and in these latter two cases the welding operation can take place while the anvil is still supported by the fluid film since it is not necessary to establish an electrical connection. The anvil may alternatively be replaced by a semi-cylindrical anvil supported in a semi-cylindrical recess for producing a linear weld. Cover means may be provided for the apparatus.

When a target microbe, e.g., a pathogenic microbe, has a binding capacity for haloperoxidase greater than that of a desired microbe, e.g., members of the normal flora, the target microbe selectively binds the haloperoxidase with little or no binding of the haloperoxidase by the desired microbe. In the presence of peroxide and halide, the target bound haloperoxidase catalyzes halide oxidation and facilitates the disproportionation of peroxide to singlet molecular oxygen at the surface of the target microbe. The lifetime of singlet molecular oxygen restricts damage to the surface resulting in selective killing of the target microbe with a minimum of collateral damage to the desired microbe or physiological medium.

When a target microbe, e.g., a pathogenic microbe, has a binding capacity for haloperoxidase greater than that of a desired microbe, e.g., members of the normal flora, the target microbe selectively binds the haloperoxidase with little or no binding of the haloperoxidase by the desired microbe. In the presence of peroxide and halide, the target bound haloperoxidase catalyzes halide oxidation and facilitates the disproportionation of peroxide to singlet molecular oxygen at the surface of the target microbe. The lifetime of singlet molecular oxygen restricts damage to the surface resulting in selective killing of the target microbe with a minimum of collateral damage to the desired microbe or physiological medium. The methods and compositions of the invention are highly useful in the therapeutic or prophylactic antiseptic treatment of human or animal subjects, since their use can be designed to be highly effective in combatting bacterial or fungal infections without significant damage to normal flora or host cells.

Solutions containing a haloperoxidase (i.e., a halide:hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) oxidoreductase, such as myeloperoxidase, eosinophil peroxidase or lactoperoxidase) plus a halide or combination of halides (i.e., chloride, bromide and/or iodide), an oxidase (i.e., a substrate:O2 oxidoreductase) capable of generating H2O2, and a substrate specific for that oxidase, are separately prepared under aerobic conditions, but all of the component solutions are made anaerobic prior to final combination and mixing. The anaerobic formulations are dispensed into containers capable of maintaining the anaerobic condition (e.g., pressurized canisters). Dispensing the solution at the time of use exposes the formulation to air (i.e., O2) which activates its disinfectant-sterilent properties. O2 is the rate limiting component for oxidase generation of H2O2. Under aerobic conditions the oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of its substrate and the reduction of O2 to generate H2O2. In turn, H2O2 serves as substrate for haloperoxidase which catalyzes the oxidation of halide to hypohalous acid. Hypohalous acid reacts with an additional H2O2 to generate singlet molecular oxygen (1O2). Hypohalous acid (e.g., hypochlorous acid) and especially 1O2 are potent microbicidal agents. Both haloperoxidase generation of hypohalous acid and its reactive consumption to yield 1O2 are dependent on the availability of H2O2. A high rate of H2O2 generation does not result in the accumulation of hypohalous acid, but instead results in a high rate of 1O2 production. The microbicidal capacity and toxicity of 1O2 are limited by the half-life of this metastable electronically excited reactant, and as such, disinfectant-sterilent activity is temporally defined by and confined to the dynamics of oxidant generation. The disinfectant-sterilent activity of formulation requires air exposure and is dependent on the presence of the halide-haloperoxidase combination employed, the activity of the oxidase present, the availability of oxidase-specific substrate and the availability of O2.",EOE INC,ALLEN ROBERT C,"EXOXEMIS, INC.

TEDDING- TON INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT, Ltd. May 11, 1955 [May 31, 1954], No. 16109/54. Class 40 (1). In an electric follow-up system wherein a motor is controlled by controlling and followup potentiometers maintained in correspondence, imperfect control, caused by poor connections between the wiper and the track of the follow-up potentiometer, is avoided by the provision of fixed potentiometers bridged across the faulty potentiometer to maintain the continuity of the circuit. A controlling potentiometer 1 having an arm 5 is controlled automatically by a temperature responsive device 4, and it is coupled in a circuit comprising a transformer 7 and relays 8 and 9 to a second potentiometer 2 having an arm 13 operated by a reversible electric motor 6. The relays 8 and 9 act in opposition on a movable contact 10 and any movement of arm 5 will unbalance the circuit and cause motor 6 to operate a valve or other device to meet the change in conditions registered at 4 and to move follow-up arm 13 until balance in the circuit is restored. Potentiometers 18, 19 are connected across potentiometer 2 so that in the event of a faulty contact between arm 13 and potentiometer 2 the continuity of the circuit will be maintained. Thus movement of arm 5 will cause motor 6 to operate in one direction or the other up to the limit set by one of limit switches 14, 15. This excessive movement will cause a change in external conditions with resulting movement of arm 5 in the opposite direction and movement of the motor up to the position set by the other limit switch. Hence the control will operate as an ""on-off"" control instead of providing modulation until potentiometer 2 is cleared of contamination by the action of traversing wiper 13. Secondary resistances 20 and 21 can be fitted across the potentiometer 1 to provide a balanced bridge system as is provided by the original circuit.",TEDDINGTON IND EQUIPMENT LTD,ALLEN NIGEL ROBERT,,https://lens.org/048-813-972-473-372,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G05D3/1472,G05D3/14,G3N NE2A          BG;;G3N NE3A          E3A;;G3N NE3X          RX;;G3N NGE3AA        GE3AA;;G3N N251          BG;;G3N N251          BR;;G3N N251          RX;;G3N N287          E3A;;G3N N287          GE3AA;;G3N N351          RX;;G3N N375          E3A;;G3N N375          GE3AA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Preferably, the state of inflammation of a patient is determined by contacting afirst portion of a phagocyte containing biological sample from the patient with an opsonified oxidative metabolism stimulating agent capable of eliciting metabolicactivation and with a chemiluminigenic substrate, contacting a second portion ofthe biological sample from the patient with an opsonin receptor expression priming agent, an opsonified oxidative metabolism stimulating agent capable of eliciting metabolic activation and a chemiluminigenic substrate, and then comparing the chemiluminescence response of the first and second portions of thesample as a measure of the immune response potential or state of inflammation ofthe patient. Phagocyte function is additionally quantitatively evaluated by measuring the phagocyte oxygenation capacity of a maximally opsonin receptor primed and stimulated biological sample of a patient, determining the specific oxygenation capacity to a set of controls representing the normal distribution of specific oxygenation capacity established from testing a large population. The phagocyte-specific oxygenation capacity is determined by contacting the sample with an opsonin receptor expression priming agent, an opsonified oxidative metabolism stimulating agent and a chemiluminigenic substrate, measuring the chemiluminescence response of the sample, determining the chemiluminescence response per phagocyte of the sample and comparing the response per phagocyte with that of the normal range of values.

The new acid optimum chemiluminescent indicator system comprises haloperoxidase (halide:hydrogen peroxide oxidoreductase), halide, oxidant and chemiluminigenic substrate. The indicator system acts as a synthesizer of highly reactive singlet molecular oxygen (<1>O2), which reacts with the chemiluminigenic substrate to yield an excited state, oxidized reaction product. The excited state reaction product then relaxes to a lower energy (e.g., ground) state with the emission of measurable light in an amount related to the amount of each of the reaction participants present in a reaction solution. Known, non-rate limiting amounts of three of the reaction participants are provided in an assay solution to determine the presence or amount of the fourth participant in a test sample. The fourth participant in the test sample may be the analyte of interest, or may be produced or consumed in the test sample through one or more preliminary reactions involving the ultimate analyte of interest, with the amount of the fourth participant being related to the amount of analyte in the test solution. Accordingly, the indicator system of the invention may be employed for the determination of a wide variety of analytes. The indicator system operates most efficiently over the range from acid to slightly basic pH, e.g., at a pH of about 3 to about 8. Also described is a variety of illustrative assay formats in which the indicator reaction of the invention may be employed, as well as kits for use in carrying out assays utilizing the haloperoxidase/halide/oxidant/substrate indicator system.",EXOXEMIS INC,ALLEN ROBERT CHARLES,"EXOXEMIS, INC.

When a target microbe, e.g., a pathogenic microbe, has a binding capacity for haloperoxidase greater than that of a desired microbe, e.g., members of the normal flora, the target microbe selectively binds the haloperoxidase with little or no binding of the haloperoxidase by the desired microbe. In the presence of peroxide and halide, the target bound haloperoxidase catalyzes halide oxidation and facilitates the disproportionation of peroxide to singlet molecular oxygen at the surface of the target microbe. The lifetime of singlet molecular oxygen restricts damage to the surface resulting in selective killing of the target microbe with a minimum of collateral damage to the desired microbe or physiological medium. The methods and compositions of the invention are highly useful in the therapeutic or prophylactic antiseptic treatment of human or animal subjects, since their use can be designed to be highly effective in combatting bacterial or fungal infections without significant damage to normal flora or host cells. Suitable haloperoxidases include myeloperoxidase (MPO), eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), lactoperoxidase (LPO), chloroperoxidase (CPO) and derivatives thereof capable of selective binding to target microbes.",EOE,ALLEN ROBERT CHARLES,,https://lens.org/090-371-720-654-06X,Patent Application,no,0,0,25,41,0,A61K38/44;;A61L12/082;;A61L12/126;;A61L15/38;;A61L15/46;;A61L2300/254;;A61L2300/404;;A61P31/00;;A61P31/04;;A61P43/00;;A01N63/50;;A61K38/44;;A61K9/70;;A61L15/46;;A61L12/082;;A61L2300/404;;A61L15/38;;A61K38/44;;A61L2300/254;;A61L12/126;;A01N63/50,A01N63/50;;A61K33/20;;A61K33/40;;A61K38/44;;A61L12/08;;A61L12/12;;A61L15/38;;A61L15/46;;A61P31/00;;A61P31/04;;A61P43/00;;C12N9/08,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The presence of vitamin ""B12 analogues"" in such samples, which analogues are erroneously assayed as true vitamin B12 utilizing prior art RIDA techniques, has been determined. Such errors are due to the fact that birding proteins commonly used in prior art RIDA techniques normally include proteins which bind both true vitamin B12 and previously unrecognized vitamin B12 analogues. The errors caused by the B12 analogues are avoided by using a composition for binding vitamin B12 which is substantially free of substances which bind vitamin B12 analogues.

B. Sept. 19. Making pianoforte soundboards. - Relates to a machine for cutting bridge - pieces to the required height after thev have been secured to pianoforte soundboards. A belt-driven cutter-spindle vertically slidable in a bracket 2 secured to a wall or standard is attached bv a collar 7 and studs 8 to a counterbalanced operating-lever 5. The studs 8 are connected by cranked links 12 to a block 13 supporting an internally-threaded sleeve 14 provided with a flange 15 at its upper end and a ring 16 at its lower end secured by a screw 17. The sleeve 14 can be adjusted by a milled disk 18 on a screw 19, which slides in a guide 22 carried by a lug 23 on the bracket 2 and is prevented from rotating by a fork 25 engaging the guide 22. A slipper 21 is carried by the rod 19 and a stay 20 fixed to the rod 19, and a roller 33 is carried by a bracket 42 supported by rods 29 adjustably mounted in brackets 28 on the rods 12. The soundboard, with the iron frame and bridge secured thereto, is supported by a table 34 mounted on wheels 35 which run on rails 36 on a truck 37 running on stationary rails 38, so that the table is free to move in any direction in an horizontal plane. A rail 39, Fig. 3, carried by wooden strips 40 is placed over the wrestpins, and the cutter is lowered by the lever 5 until the slipper 21 rests on the rail. The soundboard is then moved under the cutter, the side of the bridge-piece being kept in contact with the roller 33. The depth to which the bridge is cut is determined by the position of the sleeve 14. An adjustable stop-nut 26 is provided to limit the movement of the sleeve.

When a target microbe, e.g., a pathogenic microbe, has a binding capacity for haloperoxidase greater than that of a desired microbe, e.g., members of the normal flora, the target microbe selectively binds the haloperoxidase with little or no binding of the haloperoxidase by the desired microbe. In the presence of peroxide and halide, the target bound haloperoxidase catalyzes halide oxidation and facilitates the disproportionation of peroxide to singlet molecular oxygen at the surface of the target microbe. The lifetime of singlet molecular oxygen restricts damage to the surface resulting in selective killing of the target microbe with a minimum of collateral damage to the desired microbe or physiological medium. The methods and compositions of the invention are highly useful in the therapeutic or prophylactic antiseptic treatment of human or animal subjects, since their use can be designed to be highly effective in combatting bacterial or fungal infections without significant damage to normal flora or host cells. Suitable haloperoxidases include myeloperoxidase (MPO), eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), lactoperoxidase (LPO), chloroperoxidase (CPO) and derivatives thereof capable of selective binding to target microbes.",EXOXEMIS INC,ALLEN ROBERT CHARLES,"EXOXEMIS, INC.

In one embodiment of the invention, an image processing system may partition a spatial index into a plurality of portions such that different processing elements may be responsible for traversing a ray through different portions of the spatial index. The determination of where to partition the spatial index may be made based on any number of factors. For example, according to some embodiments of the invention, the spatial index may be partitioned to evenly distribute workload (e.g., determined by real-time performance metrics) amongst multiple processing elements. Partitioning of the spatial index to distribute workload may be based on the total number of nodes, the number of leaf nodes or the number of primitives which will be included in each resulting partition.",IBM,ALLEN SHEARER ROBERT,,https://lens.org/093-983-501-778-595,Granted Patent,no,0,0,9,9,0,G06T15/06;;G06T15/40;;G06T15/50;;G06T17/005;;G06T15/40;;G06T15/50;;G06T15/06;;G06T17/005,G06T15/06;;G06T15/40;;G06T15/50;;G06T17/00,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Correspondence control. NATIONAL RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. May 3, 1963 [March 2, 1962], No. 8136/62. Heading G1N. A movement repeating system, for example a synchro system, of the type in which a receiver coil 10 is positioned by a servomotor 16 controlled by current collected from the receiver through relatively movable contacts, e.g. slip rings 13 and brushes 14, is provided with means for applying a bias sufficient to move the servomotor and means, dependent upon the flow of current through the relatively movable contacts, for opposing this bias by a second bias to permit normal operation of the system. Thus, if dirt prevents current flowing from the slip rings to the brushes the first bias energizes the servomotor, and the rotation of the receiver generally clears the dirt from the contacts so that normal operation is resumed. If the dirt remains the system hunts which acts as a warning, or may operate a warning system. As shown the first bias is the voltage drop across resistor R b and under normal conditions this is opposed by the voltage drop across resistor R s . The equilibrium position of rotor 10 is, as a result, offset by a small angle, e.g. five minutes of arc, from correspondence with transmitter rotor 5. It is shown that the offset is constant so that compensation may be effected by providing a pointer on rotor 10 offset correspondingly. It is stated that means may be provided for stopping operation immediately the first bias ceases to be opposed.",NAT RES DEV,ALLEN NIGEL ROBERT,,https://lens.org/135-732-675-657-107,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G05D3/122,G05D3/12,G3N NE2A          BG;;G3N NE3B          E3B;;G3N NE3B          R2;;G3N NGE3AB        GE3AB;;G3N N251          BG;;G3N N251          R2;;G3N N287          E3B;;G3N N287          GE3AB;;G3N N351          R2,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Aug. 30, 1954 No. 25101/54. Class 20(3). In the utilization of daylight to light an interior through an opening in the roof or ceiling four air/glass interfaces are interposed in a horizontal position between the daylight and the interior, the interfaces being positioned on parallel outer and inner walls and the interior face of the outer wall is constructed and arranged so as to transmit only light from the Northern sky and sunlight from low altitudes, sunlight from high altitudes being totally internally reflected and rejected back to the exterior. This may be accomplished by making that face in the form of a series of parallel prisms having an included angle of approximate.y ninety degrees and adjusting the position of the prisms so that they extend in an East-West direction with one surface forming an angle of approximately thirty degrees with the horizontal plane and extending upwardly in a Southerly direction. In the particular example shown the included angle P is exactly ninety degrees and the angle b<SP>1</SP> twenty-nine degrees ; this combination shows the passage of rays, L3, L<SP>4</SP> from low altitude angles a3 and L5, L<SP>6</SP> from Northern angles a<SP>4</SP>, and the total reflection of rays L<SP>1</SP>, L2 from high altitude angles a<SP>1</SP>, a<SP>2</SP>. Such a combination would be suitable for a latitude 42 degrees North. Examples wherein b<SP>1</SP> is 30 degrees exactly and 31¢ degrees are also given. Prisms having different included angles and being arranged at different angles to the horizontal can be formed on the same face or all the prisms can be similar but may have adjacent portions of the Southerly-sloping surface arranged at different angles to the horizontal. The range of included angles may be 82 to 98 degrees but other examples are given wherein the range may be from 60 to 87 degrees (particularly 75 degrees) and the angle with the horizontal may then be of the order 35 to 45 degrees. The inner and outer faces of the inner wall may comprise ribs, those on one face being at right angles to those on the other, or may comprise parallel rows of depressed pyramids those on one surface being diagonal to those on the other surface.

Hockey Stick/Blade Safety Cord ABSTRACT My invention is an ice hockey stick safety device comprising of three components that when secured together prevents the hockey stick shaft and hockey stick blade from being launched into the air and possibly striking a person when they become dislodged. The device is made up of an ice hockey stick blade Locking Connector, a Connect Cord and a Cord Plug Lock. When combined together these components prevent the separation of a hockey stick blade from the hockey stick shaft. This invention will help prevent injuries in the game of ice hockey. SPECIFICATION This invention relates generally to an improved hockey stick that participants use in the sport of ice hockey. In particular, this invention improves currently available hockey sticks with a feature that tethers separated portions of the hockey stick to each other. As a result, the separated portions of the hockey stick will be unable to function as projectiles, thus reducing the potential to injure other participants or spectators. In addition, the separated portions of the hockey stick will remain connected and will thus be quicker, easier and safer to remove from the playing surface. This will further reduce the risk of injury to the participants. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Participants in the sport of hockey use hockey sticks for multiple purposes. When acting in an offensive fashion, the participant may use a hockey stick to receive a hockey puck, pass a hockey puck, control a hockey puck as the participant moves about the playing surface, and shoot a hockey puck toward the other team's goal in an attempt to score. When acting in a defensive fashion, the participant may use a hockey stick to block a puck from traveling to a member of the opposing team, steal a puck from the opposing team, and stop a puck from entering the participant's goal. Many other uses for a hockey stick are possible while participating in the sport of hockey. Hockey sticks are typically comprised of two major components, a shaft and a blade. The participant grasps the shaft with one or two hands and uses the blade portion of hockey stick to touch the puck while acting in both offensive and defensive fashions. One version of a hockey stick, the one-piece version, is manufactured to have no discernible coupling between the shaft and the blade.

Solutions containing a haloperoxidase (i.e., a halide:hydrogen peroxide (H.sub.2 O.sub.2) oxidoreductase, such as myeloperoxidase, eosinophil peroxidase or lactoperoxidase) plus a halide or combination of halides (i.e., chloride, bromide and/or iodide), an oxidase (i.e., a substrate:O.sub.2 oxidoreductase) capable of generating H.sub.2 O.sub.2, and a substrate specific for that oxidase, are separately prepared under aerobic conditions, but all of the component solutions are made anaerobic prior to final combination and mixing. The anaerobic formulations are dispensed into containers capable of maintaining the anaerobic condition (e.g., pressurized canisters). Dispensing the solution at the time of use exposes the formulation to air (i.e., O.sub.2) which activates its disinfectant-sterilent properties. O.sub.2 is the rate limiting component for oxidase generation of H.sub.2 O.sub.2. Under aerobic conditions the oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of its substrate and the reduction of O.sub.2 to generate H.sub.2 O.sub.2. In turn, H.sub.2 O.sub.2 serves as substrate for haloperoxidase which catalyzes the oxidation of halide to hypohalous acid. Hypohalous acid reacts with an additional H.sub.2 O.sub.2 to generate singlet molecular oxygen (.sup.1 O.sub.2). Hypohalous acid (e.g., hypochlorous acid) and especially .sup.1 O.sub.2 are potent microbicidal agents. Both haloperoxidase generation of hypohalous acid and its reactive consumption to yield .sup.1 O.sub.2 are dependent on the availability of H.sub.2 O.sub.2. A high rate of H.sub.2 O.sub.2 generation does not result in the accumulation of hypohalous acid, but instead results in a high rate of .sup.1 O.sub.2 production. The microbicidal capacity and toxicity of .sup.1 O.sub.2 are limited by the half-life of this metastable electronically excited reactant, and as such, disinfectant-sterilent activity is temporally defined by and confined to the dynamics of oxidant generation. The disinfectant-sterilent activity of formulation requires air exposure and is dependent on the presence of the halide-haloperoxidase combination employed, the activity of the oxidase present, the availability of oxidase-specific substrate and the availability of O.sub.2.",EXOXEMIS INC,ALLEN ROBERT C,EXOXEMIS INC (1999-05-24),https://lens.org/052-602-222-340-68X,Granted Patent,yes,21,19,18,18,0,A61L2/16;;A61L2/186;;A61L2/22;;A61L12/082;;A61L12/126;;A61L15/38;;A61L15/46;;A61L2202/122;;A61L2202/24;;A61L2300/102;;A61L2300/106;;A61L2300/11;;A61L2300/254;;A61L2300/404;;C12N9/0065;;A61K38/00;;A61K45/06;;A61K31/198;;A61P27/02;;A61P31/04;;A61P43/00;;C12N9/0004;;A61L2/186;;A61L2300/254;;A61L2300/106;;A61L2202/122;;A61L15/38;;A61L2/16;;A61L12/126;;A61L2300/404;;A61L12/082;;A61L2300/102;;A61L2/22;;C12N9/0065;;A61L2300/11;;A61L2202/24;;A61L15/46;;A61K38/00;;A61K31/198;;A61K45/06,A01N59/00;;A01N63/00;;A61K31/195;;A61K38/44;;A61K31/215;;A61K31/50;;A61K33/00;;A61K33/18;;A61K33/20;;A61K33/40;;A61K45/00;;A61L2/16;;A61L2/18;;A61L2/22;;A61L12/08;;A61L12/12;;A61L15/38;;A61L15/46;;A61P27/02;;A61P31/04;;A61P43/00;;C12N9/08,424/94.4;;435/189;;435/190;;435/192;;422/28;;514/579;;514/42;;514/561;;514/564,54,50,050-888-138-053-040;;069-310-254-038-891;;062-969-369-720-023;;045-098-900-009-715;;003-823-473-457-075;;090-782-432-670-184;;121-295-466-811-728;;095-739-159-650-921;;091-474-220-544-09X;;003-109-391-866-416;;095-690-572-465-426;;037-935-703-638-104;;021-448-372-361-550;;007-824-119-960-049;;060-764-360-171-652;;006-931-672-556-284;;008-460-440-174-716;;002-355-272-165-139;;009-957-578-966-804;;034-293-009-141-471;;105-948-493-766-93X;;114-534-084-787-832;;071-739-998-213-617;;002-090-721-990-644;;015-185-172-637-859;;025-373-056-333-226;;050-888-138-053-040;;028-027-362-992-796;;053-542-701-199-817;;059-109-404-949-504;;066-477-767-562-993;;053-152-271-259-192;;066-665-132-906-826;;020-168-279-589-371;;046-914-166-013-419;;054-532-112-357-650;;180-950-096-601-886;;014-774-062-605-169;;046-234-712-314-587;;032-461-463-704-745;;016-732-930-318-651;;004-277-088-420-437;;018-508-567-598-092;;146-360-213-577-510;;025-017-983-260-442;;101-860-166-446-806;;004-365-068-830-973;;096-551-824-967-673;;005-738-650-320-27X;;081-535-746-897-272,10.1128/jb.95.6.2131-2138.1968;;4970226;;pmc315145;;5026288;;10.1016/0006-291x(72)90545-1;;1131257;;10.1016/s0006-291x(75)80437-2;;10.1016/s0006-291x(75)80438-4;;236746;;10.1016/s0006-291x(76)80299-9;;1259763;;323143;;pmc421447;;10.1128/iai.15.3.828-833.1977;;908850;;10.1093/infdis/136.4.510;;40833;;10.1016/b978-0-12-549902-6.50031-5;;10.1093/infdis/144.4.344;;6270214;;7055431;;10.1001/archsurg.1982.01380260019004;;10.1515/9783110861051-101;;10.1016/b978-0-12-044080-1.50015-8;;10.1007/978-1-4684-8088-7_39;;6283834;;pmc263265;;6430809;;10.1128/iai.45.2.475-482.1984;;3821549;;10.1016/0076-6879(86)33085-4;;2475901;;10.1093/clinids/11.4.549;;3041216;;10.1056/nejm198709103171107;;10.1111/j.1398-9995.1980.tb01711.x;;6245598;;10.1016/b978-0-12-597640-4.50007-9;;6847888;;10.1146/annurev.iy.01.040183.001331;;6242465;;5824754;;10.1111/j.1751-1097.1969.tb05679.x;;10.1016/s0021-9258(18)32358-5;;6853474;;5817553;;10.1128/jb.99.2.361-365.1969;;pmc250023;;10.1016/0304-4165(66)90152-8;;4380562;;10.1128/jb.95.6.2131-2138.1968;;4970226;;pmc315145;;10.1128/iai.44.2.534-536.1984;;6325350;;pmc263559;;10.1084/jem.137.2.438;;pmc2139475;;4685704;;4311694;;10.1126/science.167.3915.195;;pmc249738;;5773015;;10.1128/jb.97.2.635-639.1969;;5333458;;10.1099/00221287-43-1-31;;13435800;;10.1007/bf00407583;;10.1128/br.21.2.112-131.1957;;pmc180890;;13436358;;10.1016/s0021-9673(00)82854-x;;4443399;;10.1093/clinchem/19.12.1350;;4757363;;10.1016/s0031-9422(00)91502-4;;5469575;;10.1007/bf00409515;;10.2307/3756216;;1120184;;10.1182/blood.v45.2.161.161;;10.1016/s0021-9258(17)40127-x;;194894;;3015901;;10.1016/s0021-9258(18)67570-2;;pmc416025;;10.1128/iai.2.4.414-418.1970;;16557854;;5432025;;5242086;;10.1111/j.1432-1033.1968.tb00246.x;;10.1099/00221287-4-1-38;;15415555;;1118738;;4966707;;10.1056/nejm196902272800902;;4974160;;10.1172/jci107963;;pmc301784;;1117067,"Klebanoff, Myeloperoxidase Halide Hydrogen Peroxide Antibacterial System, J.

The new acid optimum chemiluminescent indicator system comprises haloperoxidase (halide:hydrogen peroxide oxidoreductase), halide, oxidant and chemiluminigenic substrate. The indicator system acts as a synthesizer of highly reactive singletmolecular oxygen (), which reacts with the chemiluminigenic substrate to yield an excited state, oxidized reaction product. The excited state reaction product then relaxes to a lower energy (e.g., ground) state with the emission of measurable light in an amount related to the amount of each of the reaction participants present in a reaction solution. Known, non-rate limiting amounts of three of thereaction participants are provided in an assay solution to determine the presence or amount of the fourth participant in a test sample. The fourth participant in the test sample may be the analyte of interest, or may be produced or consumed in the test sample through one or more preliminary reactions involving the ultimateanalyte of interest, with the amount of the fourth participant being related to the amount of analyte in the test solution. Accordingly, the indicator system of theinvention may be employed for the determination of a wide variety of analytes. The indicator system operates most efficiently over the range from acid to slightly basic pH, e.g., at a pH of about 3 to about 8. Also described is a variety of illustrative assay formats in which the indicator reaction of the invention may be employed, as well as kits for use in carrying out assays utilizing the haloperoxidase/halide/oxidant/substrate indicator system.",EXOXEMIS INC,ALLEN ROBERT C,,https://lens.org/092-812-934-128-149,Patent Application,no,0,0,16,16,0,C12Q1/28;;C12Q1/28,C12Q1/28,D215000032   M;;15000033   S;;15000151   S,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Jan.26, 1967 [Feb.9, 1966], No.3934/67. Heading C7B. A method of anodizing selected metallic areas on a substrate comprises maintaining each such area in alignment with an opening in a reservoir, allowing the liquid to flow by gravity into contact with each metallic area and applying a current through the liquid in each reservoir to anodize the respective metallic area. As shown substrate 12 has a thin film circuit thereon comprising resistors 13-19 of an anodizable metal such as tantalum, low-ohmic paths 21, 22 and contact areas 26- 36. The substrate is inverted over the surface of block 51 having reservoirs 63-69 corresponding to the resistors and the resistors and reservoirs are aligned by means of locator pins 70 and spring clips 71. Lid 73, when closed and held by spring retainer 78, presses the substrate into contact with the surface of the block by rubber pad 76. Inversion of the block about trunnions 46 allows liquid in the reservoirs to flow into contact with the selected areas on the substrate and in this position current passes between a cathode situated within each reservoir, through the solution and the selected areas, and anodes 101-111 mounted in bores in the block and spring-biased against the contact areas on the substrate. Anodes and cathodes are connected to an external current source and provision is made for monitoring the change in resistance of each selected area as anodizing proceeds.",WESTERN ELECTRIC CO,GERHARD ALLEN ROBERT,,https://lens.org/105-556-934-136-392,Granted Patent,no,0,0,4,4,0,C25D17/005;;C25D11/022;;C25D11/005;;H10N97/00;;C25D17/005;;C25D11/022;;C25D11/005;;H10N97/00,C25D11/02;;C25D17/00;;H01L49/02,C7B BAP           AP;;C7B BA2A2         -;;C7B BA2C3         -;;C7B BA5           -;;C7B BGAX          GAX;;C7B B124          AP,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Preferably, the state of inflammation of a patient is determined by contacting a first portion of a phagocyte containing biological sample from the patient with an opsonified oxidative metabolism stimulating agent capable of eliciting metabolic activation and with a chemiluminigenic substrate, contacting a second portion of the biological sample from the patient with an opsonin receptor expression priming agent, an opsonified oxidative metabolism stimulating agent capable of eliciting metabolic activation and a chemiluminigenic substrate, and then comparing the chemiluminescence response of the first and second portions of the sample as a measure of the immune response potential or state of inflammation of the patient. Phagocyte function is additionally quantitatively evaluated by measuring the phagocyte oxygenation capacity of a maximally opsonin receptor primed and stimulated biological sample of a patient, determining the specific oxygenation capacity to a set of controls representing the normal distribution of specific oxygenation capacity established from testing a large population. The phagocyte-specific oxygenation capacity is determined by contacting the sample with an opsonin receptor expression priming agent, an opsonified oxidative metabolism stimulating agent and a chemiluminigenic substrate, measuring the chemiluminescence response of the sample, determining the chemiluminescence response per phagocyte of the sample and comparing the response per phagocyte with that of the normal range of values.

When a target microbe, e.g., a pathogenic microbe, has a binding capacity for haloperoxidase greater than that of a desired microbe, e.g., members of the normal flora, the target microbe selectively binds the haloperoxidase with little or no binding of the haloperoxidase by the desired microbe. In the presence of peroxide and halide, the target bound haloperoxidase catalyzes halide oxidation and facilitates the disproportionation of peroxide to singlet molecular oxygen at the surface of the target microbe. The lifetime of singlet molecular oxygen restricts damage to the surface resulting in selective killing of the target microbe with a minimum of collateral damage to the desired microbe or physiological medium. The methods and compositions of the invention are highly useful in the therapeutic or prophylactic antiseptic treatment of human or animal subjects, since their use can be designed to be highly effective in combatting bacterial or fungal infections without significant damage to normal flora or host cells.

When a target microbe, e.g., a pathogenic microbe, has a binding capacity for haloperoxidase greater than that of a desired microbe, e.g., members of the normal flora, the target microbe selectively binds the haloperoxidase with little or no binding of the haloperoxidase by the desired microbe. In the presence of peroxide and halide, the target bound haloperoxidase catalyzes halide oxidation and facilitates the disproportionation of peroxide to singlet molecular oxygen at the surface of the target microbe. The lifetime of singlet molecular oxygen restricts damage to the surface resulting in selective killing of the target microbe with a minimum of collateral damage to the desired microbe or physiological medium. The methods and compositions of the invention are highly useful in the therapeutic or prophylactic antiseptic treatment of human or animal subjects, since their use can be designed to be highly effective in combatting bacterial or fungal infections without significant damage to normal flora or host cells.

According to one embodiment of the invention, as a ray is traversed through a spatial index, a leaf node may be reached. Subsequent rays that traverse through the spatial index may reach the same leaf node. In contrast to sending information defining a ray issued by the workload manager to a vector throughput engine each time a ray reaches a leaf node, the workload manager may determine if a series of rays reach the same leaf node and send information defining the series of rays to the vector throughput engine. Thus, network traffic may be reduced by sending information which defines a series of rays which are traversed to a common (i.e., the same) leaf node in contrast to sending information each time a ray is traversed to a leaf node.",IBM,SHEARER ROBERT ALLEN,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (2006-08-21),https://lens.org/159-388-745-569-796,Granted Patent,yes,10,4,2,2,0,G06T15/06;;G06T15/06;;G06T15/40;;G06T15/40,G06T15/40,345/421;;345/426;;345/502,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The hollow axle A of the driving-wheel is fitted with a movable rod B having projecting pins B<1>, adapted to engage with the driving-mechanism to alter the gear. On one end of the axle screws the securing-nut C, which has a reduced cylindrical part C<2> provided with a groove C<3>. Round the cylindrical part fits a sleeve D having screws D<1>, which engage in the groove C<3>, and the internal surface of the sleeve is formed with helical grooves D<2>, in which engage projections on a disc B' secured to the rod B. Two cords are connected to a pulley on the sleeve, and one of them is connected to means which, when operated by the driver, rotate the sleeve and move the rod to change the gear. The other cord may be connected either to a retracting-spring, or to the operating means. In the form shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the cord, connected to the sleeve, is moved by rotating the ring H by means of a spring lever H<1>. The lever normally rests in one of a series of slots in a flange F<1> on the casing F, which is fixed to the handle-bars or other part by clips G. The ring is provided with an inner adjustable cone H<2> connected to the cord, and is held in frictional contact with the ring by a screw plug I'.

   The present invention is a method and apparatus for measuring the performance of a subroutine in a software application executing upon a computer system. When characterized as a method, a monitoring application operating according to the present invention first intercepts a call to a subroutine. The monitoring application then examines a system clock. If the clock is in a particular configuration, the monitoring application collects a first set of performance data. Next, the monitoring application passes control to the subroutine. When the subroutine completes, control is returned to the monitoring application. The monitoring application then collects a second set of performance data. The first and second sets of data are then compared to determine the performance characteristics of the subroutine. If the clock in not in the particular configuration, the monitoring application passes control to the subroutine in such a way that processing continues as it would if the monitoring program had never been called.

April 16, 1963 [April 24, 1962], No. 15488/62. Heading B8A. In a rotary feeder for delivering pulverulent material to a pneumatic conveyer system, comprising a rotor element within a cylindrical casing 1 having end walls, the rotor element comprises pockets 10 formed by vanes 9 which are substantially tangential to the rotor hub 8 and twisted helically relative to the axis of the rotor, and are forwardly curved in the direction of rotation. The rotor element is mounted on a shaft 5 which is journalled in bearings in the end walls of the casing 1. The vanes 9 are of a cross-sectional profile such that at the operational speed of the rotor, a particle 14 delivered under gravity through an opening 11 in the top of the casing 1, will continue its vertical path 16 while still in contact with either the leading, 15, or trailing face, 17, of the vane. The helical twist of the vanes is such that at the operational speed of the rotor, the outlet ends of the pockets trail behind the air inlet ends of the pockets by an amount which will ensure that the air of the conveyer system passing from an inlet to an outlet port 13 in opposite end walls of the casing 1 will travel along a substantially straight path whilst scavenging the pockets 10.",SIMON LTD HENRY,ALLEN ROBERT WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/119-099-997-189-982,Granted Patent,no,0,4,2,2,0,B65G53/4633,B65G53/46,B8A A8M           A8M;;B8A A802          A8M;;B8A A829          A8M;;B8A A860          A8M,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

When a target microbe, e.g., a pathogenic microbe, has a binding capacity for haloperoxidase greater than that of a desired microbe, e.g., members of the normal flora, the target microbe selectively binds the haloperoxidase with little or no binding of the haloperoxidase by the desired microbe. In the presence of peroxide and halide, the target bound haloperoxidase catalyzes halide oxidation and facilitates the disproportionation of peroxide to singlet molecular oxygen at the surface of the target microbe. The lifetime of singlet molecular oxygen restricts damage to the surface resulting in selective killing of the target microbe with a minimum of collateral damage to the desired microbe or physiological medium. The methods and compositions of the invention are highly useful in the therapeutic or prophylactic antiseptic treatment of human or animal subjects, since their use can be designed to be highly effective in combatting bacterial or fungal infections without significant damage to normal flora or host cells. Suitable haloperoxidases include myeloperoxidase (MPO), eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), lactoperoxidase (LPO), chloroperoxidase (CPO) and derivatives thereof capable of selective binding to target microbes.",EXOXEMIS INC,ALLEN ROBERT CHARLES,"EXOXEMIS, INC.

Phagocyte function is additionally quantitatively evaluated by measuring the phagocyte oxygenation capacity of a maximally opsonin receptor primed and stimulated biological sample of a patient, determining the specific oxygenation capacity to a set of controls representing the normal distribution of specific oxygenation capacity established from testing a large population. The phagocyte-specific oxygenation capacity is determined by contacting the sample with an opsonin receptor expression priming agent, an opsonified oxidative metabolism stimulating agent and a chemiluminigenic substrate, measuring the chemiluminescence response of the sample, determining the chemiluminescence response per phagocyte of the sample and comparing the response per phagocyte with that of the normal range of values.

Solutions containing a haloperoxidase (i.e., a halide:hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) oxidoreductase, such as myeloperoxidase, eosinophil peroxidase or lactoperoxidase) plus a halide or combination of halides (i.e., chloride, bromide and/or iodide), an oxidase (i.e., a substrate:O2 oxidoreductase) capable of generating H2O2, and a substrate specific for that oxidase, are separately prepared under aerobic conditions, but all of the component solutions are made anaerobic prior to final combination and mixing. The anaerobic formulations are dispensed into containers capable of maintaining the anaerobic condition (e.g., pressurized canisters). Dispensing the solution at the time of use exposes the formulation to air (i.e., O2) which activates its disinfectant-sterilent properties. O2 is the rate limiting component for oxidase generation of H2O2. Under aerobic conditions the oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of its substrate and the reduction of O2 to generate H2O2. In turn, H2O2 serves as substrate for haloperoxidase which catalyzes the oxidation of halide to hypohalous acid. Hypohalous acid reacts with an additional H2O2 to generate singlet molecular oxygen (1O2). Hypohalous acid (e.g., hypochlorous acid) and especially 1O2 are potent microbicidal agents. Both haloperoxidase generation of hypohalous acid and its reactive consumption to yield 1O2 are dependent on the availability of H2O2. A high rate of H2O2 generation does not result in the accumulation of hypohalous acid, but instead results in a high rate of 1O2 production. The microbicidal capacity and toxicity of 1O2 are limited by the half-life of this metastable electronically excited reactant, and as such, disinfectant-sterilent activity is temporally defined by and confined to the dynamics of oxidant generation. The disinfectant-sterilent activity of formulation requires air exposure and is dependent on the presence of the halide-haloperoxidase combination employed, the activity of the oxidase present, the availability of oxidase-specific substrate and the availability of O2.",EXOXEMIS INC,ALLEN ROBERT C,"EXOXEMIS, INC.

Phagocyte function is additionally quantitatively evaluated by measuring the phagocyte oxygenation capacity of a maximally opsonin receptor primed and stimulated biological sample of a patient, determining the specific oxygenation capacity per phagocyte in the sample, and comparing the specific oxygenation capacity to a set of controls representing the normal distribution of specific oxygenation established from testing a large population. The phagocyte-specific oxygenation capacity is determined by contacting the sample with an opsonin receptor expression priming agent, an opsonified oxidative metabolism stimulating agent and a chemiluminigenic substrate, measuring the chemiluminescence response of the sample, determining the chemiluminescence response per phagocyte of the sample and comparing the response per phagocyte with that of the normal range of values.

Preferably, the state of inflammation of a patient is determined by contacting a first portion of a phagocyte containing biological sample from the patient with an opsonified oxidative metabolism stimulating agent capable of eliciting metabolic activation and with a chemiluminigenic substrate, contacting a second portion of the biological sample from the patient with an opsonin receptor expression priming agent, an opsonified oxidative metabolism stimulating agent capable of eliciting metabolic activation and a chemiluminigenic substrate, and then comparing the chemiluminescence response of the first and second portions of the sample as a measure of the immune response potential or state of inflammation of the patient. Phagocyte function is additionally quantitatively evaluated by measuring the phagocyte oxygenation capacity of a maximally opsonin receptor primed and stimulated biological sample of a patient, determining the specific oxygenation capacity to a set of controls representing the normal distribution of specific oxygenation capacity established from testing a large population. The phagocyte-specific oxygenation capacity is determined by contacting the sample with an opsonin receptor expression priming agent, an opsonified oxidative metabolism stimulating agent and a chemiluminigenic substrate, measuring the chemiluminescence response of the sample, determining the chemiluminescence response per phagocyte of the sample and comparing the response per phagocyte with that of the normal range of values.

The trailing arms (20, 21) are connected to the axle (24) such that the axle extends transversely of both the trailing arms and the longitudinal longitudinal axis of the vehicle. The suspension further includes springs, preferably air springs (25), located to provide resilient interaction between the chassis (22) and the axle (24). In order to provide a degree of roll stabilisation whilst avoiding undue twisting and bending moments on the axle (24), a cross-member (30) is provided that extends between the trailing arms (20, 21) rearwardly of where they are pivoted to the vehicle chassis (22), this cross-member (30) being rigidly connected to each arm (20, 21) and having substantial stiffness with respect to bending about both its own longitudinal axis and that of the vehicle. Preferably, the air springs (26) act on the trailling arms (20, 21) forwardly of the axle (24); in this case, where the axle is the rear axle of the vehicle, a greater lowering of the vehicle rear will be achieved upon deflation of the air springs (26) and this can be used to facilitate entry/exit through the rear of the vehicle. <IMAGE>",SOUTH EASTERN ASSOCIATES LIMIT,ALLEN ROBERT JOHN,,https://lens.org/055-044-825-229-302,Patent Application,no,6,0,2,2,0,B60G9/003;;B60G11/44;;B60G11/64;;B60G2200/31;;B60G2202/112;;B60G2202/136;;B60G2202/152;;B60G2206/20,B60G9/00;;B60G11/44;;B60G11/64,B7D DSCK          DSCK,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

By means of a clutch-sleeve C in sliding engagement with it, this wheel may be locked either to a clutch-member a formed on the fixed axle A, when the gearing comes into action, or to the clutch-member b secured to an extension of the hub, when the gearing is locked and the hub is rotated at the same speed as the chain-ring. In the intermediate position, the sleeve C is free from both a and b. The sleeve is moved to and fro by an arrangement of the same nature as that described in Specification No. 24,703, A.D. 1899, i.e., it rotates in a ring c', which has radial studs in engagement with inclined slots in the casing c' and can be turned by means of a telescopic arm c<7>, c<8> passing through a slot in the side of the casing from any convenient point. The chain-ring is in two parts connected by a ratchet-clutch which gives a free wheel on the high gear. When the clutch-sleeve is moved to set the low gear in action, its bevelled end pushes that pawls outwards by means of radial studs e so that the parts are locked for rotation in both directions.

When a target microbe, e.g., a pathogenic microbe, has a binding capacity for haloperoxidase greater than that of a desired microbe, e.g., members of the normal flora, the target microbe selectively binds the haloperoxidase with little or no binding of the haloperoxidase by the desired microbe. In the presence of peroxide and halide, the target bound haloperoxidase catalyzes halide oxidation and facilitates the disproportionation of peroxide to singlet molecular oxygen at the surface of the target microbe. The lifetime of singlet molecular oxygen restricts damage to the surface resulting in selective killing of the target microbe with a minimum of collateral damage to the desired microbe or physiological medium. The methods and compositions of the invention are highly useful in the therapeutic or prophylactic antiseptic treatment of human or animal subjects, since their use can be designed to be highly effective in combatting bacterial or fungal infections without significant damage to normal flora or host cells. Suitable haloperoxidases include myeloperoxidase (MPO), eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), lactoperoxidase (LPO), chloroperoxidase (CPO) and derivatives thereof capable of selective binding to target microbes.","EXOXEMIS, INC.","ALLEN, ROBERT CHARLES","EXOXEMIS, INC.

XEROX CORP. 27 Sept., 1966 [1 Oct., 1965], No. 43078/66. Headings H2J and H2L. [Also in Division G3] A system for synchronizing incoming signals having a predetermined pulse repetition frequency with locally generated signals, comprises a controllable frequency oscillator, timing means responsive to said oscillator for generating a pattern of repetitive signals including timing signals having a pulse repetition frequency substantially equal to said predetermined pulse repetition frequency, first control means responsive to the detection of a grossly out-of-synchronous condition for increasing the frequency of said oscillator to a first higher frequency, second control means responsive to the detection of a slightly out-of-synchronous condition for increasing the frequency of said oscillator to a second higher frequency, said second higher frequency being higher than said predetermined frequency but lower than said first higher frequency, and means responsive to the detection of a substantially synchronized condition terminating the action of the first and/or said second control means. The system is applied to facsimile transceivers adapted to operate through a direct dialling telephone network, telephone 135 being used to dial the corresponding telephone at another location, after which handset 137 is placed in box 127. A document is inserted in one of the scanners 126 which sends a control signal to circuit 140 is adapting the transceiver to the transmit mode. Scanner 126 also sends video signals to transmitter 138 which combines them with the control signals and introduces them into the handset for transmission over the telephone line. At the same time circuit 139 exchanges signals with printer 142 and processes circuit 140. At the other transceiver, a signal is picked up from the handset and is detected by receiver 141 which causes circuit 140 to put the transceiver into the receive mode and to control circuit 139 to bring printer 142 into synchronism with scanner 126. A supervisory circuit 143 sounds an alarm when a transmission is completed or interrupted. The printing mechanism comprises a drum geared to a two-pole synchronous motor and attached to a pair of camoperated switches, a pen carriage carrying a marking tip which is urged into contact with the drum by an electromagnet. The pen is driven by forward and reverse stepping motors, Fig. 3 (not shown). The scanning mechanism has a pair of rolls driven by a stepping motor for feeding paper through the scanner. A mirror galvanometer samples light reflected from the paper and passes it to a photomultiplier. Fig. 4 (not shown). The timing circuits comprise an oscillator 201 providing a train of pulses to a divider chain 203 of flip-flops I-VII, the output of stage VI being the signal A which drives the drum motor, the associated cam-switches generating signals M, #M, and S. The counter 203 is connected to gates 205-209, 215-223, and inverters 210-214, 226-233 to provide the various timing signals C-N. The telephone box has a loud-speaker sealed to the microphone of the handset and connected to an oscillator followed by an audio-amplifier, and a two-level input signal is applied to the oscillator for introducing facsimile signals into the telephone circuit. An inductive coil is placed under the earphone to pick up incoming signals. In the absence of black areas which the photomultiplier is adapted to detect, a document is scanned rapidly and no video information is transmitted but advance signals are directed to the transmitter stepping motor. If a black area is detected during a fast scan, the document is not advanced and the scanning action reverts to a slow mode, an alerting signal is sent and thereafter video signals are transmitted. At the end of a slow scan, the document is advanced one increment, a paper advance signal is transmitted, and the scanner executes a rapid retrace during which video signals are not transmitted. If information is detected during the retrace, a further slow scan is made and paper advance is withheld, but, if no information is detected, rapid scans and advances are continued. Faster transmission may be afforded optionally by skipping alternate scan lines. Recording drum 122 is driven by motor 150 operated by signal A, pen carriage 154 being driven by stepping motors 160, 161, in accordance with the D signals are by pulses from NOR gate 609. The video signal is applied to marking tip 156 and the pen-engage signal to the appropriate coil. Cams 162, 163 provide signals S, M, M to control the timing circuits, and limit switches 612, 613, regulate the reversal of the stepping motors 160, 161. Relay K5 operates alarm signal 624. The facsimile transceiver transmits a series of B signals prior to the transmission of control or video signals so that synchronization is established. If the receiver is initially far out of synchronism, a pulse from multivibrator 719 is applied to diodes 204 to reset all stages of counter 203 to zero, whereby drum 122 is accelerated and synchronism is approached. If a coincidence is detected between the incoming B signal and the Q signal, then L signals are enabled to re-set the counter which cycles at an average rate only slightly above normal. This permits the receiver to advance slowly the small amount required to achieve full synchronization. When substantial synchronization is achieved, the printer control circuit responds to incoming signals. The oscillator 201 and divider 203 may be replaced by a variable frequency oscillator. In the receiving mode, flip-flop 705 gates either of two control voltages to the oscillator to cause it to speed up. Achievement of approximate synchronization re-sets flip-flop 716 and passes signals through gates 721, 723, 725, 726, to a phasesensitive detector which compares them with an internal B signal and produces a phase lock correction for application to the oscillator.",XEROX CORP,GERHARD ALLEN ROBERT,,https://lens.org/015-576-121-828-960,Granted Patent,no,0,1,7,50,0,H04N1/36;;H04N1/36,H04N1/36,G3N NE2B          E2B;;G3N NGE2B         GE2B;;G3N N287          GE2B;;G3R R110C         R33D;;G3R R112X         R33D;;G3R R33D3A        -;;G3R R4            -;;G3R R69           -;;G3R R7R           -;;G3R R7T           -;;G3R R72N          R33D;;G3R R72Y          R33D;;G3R R8L           -;;G3R R8R           -;;H2J JCSS          JCSS;;H2J JSM           JSM;;H2J J12N3B        J13;;H2J J12N3Y        J13;;H2J J13           -;;H2J J5            -;;H2J J9D           -;;H2J J9X           -;;H2L L2A           -;;H2L L2B1X         -;;H2L L2C2          -;;H2L L2D1          -;;H2L L2D6          -;;H2L L4            -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

TELEDYNE Inc. 28 Feb., 1966, No. 8620/66. Heading F3A. A detonating fuze cord assembly including an end probe, is adapted to be releasably coupled to other parts of an explosive train, and is designed to avoid the explosive escape of particles during the detonation. The end of a fuze cord 10 is reduced to provide an extending part 32 of smaller diameter than the cord 10. For a large fuze this may require the quantity of explosive distributed linearly to be reduced, but in small fuzes the reduction may be only of the parts covering the explosive. The reduced part 32 extends through and beyond a coupler body 12 and is surrounded by a sealing cap 20 of stainless steel or aluminium, which may enclose a booster charge 22, so as to form a probe. The coupler body 12 is provided with a bayonet-type connector 14 for connection to an adjacent part 24 having an explosive train chamber 26 into which the probe enters. In modifications, Figs. 2-5 (not shown), two probes are connected to a body (36), Fig. 2, to actuate a common percussion member (44) which ignites a main charge (50), or four probes are connected to a common body (Fig. 3). In Fig. 4 a probe is connected to a body (56) for initiating an explosion through a bulkhead, and in which an initiating charge (58, 60) is separated from the probe by a solid part of the body (56).

Pneumatic conveyers. SIMON Ltd., HENRY. Aug. 4, 1960 [Aug. 5, 1959], No. 26680/59. Class 78 (1). Apparatus for the fluidization of dry pulverulent material to facilitate its conveyance comprises an inclined porous material i and means for producing cyclic changes of air pressure to enable the material i to move and mechanically agitate the pulverulent material as it is fluidized by the compressed air. As shown in Fig. 4, a compressor b feeds a reservoir a via an adjustable reducing valve d. When the air in the reservoir a is at a predetermined pressure, it lifts a valve m and is thus permitted to act upon a piston x which thereby displaces a cam 11 so as to open a valve 12. The latter permits highpressure air to pass to act on a piston n and this opens a valve f to allow air from the reservoir a to pass to a rotary distributer u. The latter passes the air to one of a series of chambers h each having a respective porous diaphragm i. The effect of the air being released from the reservoir a to the chamber h causes a drop in pressure and a consequent closing of the valve m. The piston x is returned by its spring 13 and consequently the valve 12 is closed. Pressure is no longer supplied to piston n and the valve f is closed by its return spring. Pressure now commences to build up again in the reservoir a until it is sufficient to open valve n and the cycle recommences. Each time the piston x is deflected, a pawl y engages a projection on the distributer u so as to connect the air supply with successive chambers h. Instead of the connecting pipe from the distributer to the chamber h being as shown, it may be arranged as in Fig. 2 in which further air is drawn in through a tunnel q by Venturi action. The whole of the porous material i may be flexible. Alternatively it may be rigid, and it may be resiliently mounted around its periphery so as to permit its deflection (Fig. 3, not shown). In a simpler modification (Fig. 1, not shown) the outlet from the valve m is connected directly to the chamber of the piston n.",SIMON LTD HENRY,ALLEN ROBERT WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/036-263-458-838-077,Granted Patent,no,0,10,1,1,0,B65G35/005;;B01J8/40;;B65D88/72,B01J8/40;;B65D88/72,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Cordner, R. A. July 30. Clutches.-Relates to the free-wheel back-pedalling clutch shown in Fig. 2 in section on the dotted line of Fig. 1. To the hub a of the driving-wheel a concentric ring c is secured, preferably by the locking-ring d and screws d<1>. The gear-wheel b has an inner eccentric surface forming with the concentric surface of the ring c a crescentshaped space g, in which is placed a loose ball or roller g<1> of diameter less than the greatest width of the space g. Between the gear-wheel and the ring c antifriction balls e run in a ball race closed by a ring f. When the pedals are held so that the widest part of the crescent-shaped space occupies its lowest position, the driving - wheel rotates without rotation of the pedals. In the application of the clutch to the crank axle, the inner surface of the gear-wheel is concentric, and the outer surface of the ring, which is secured to the axle, is eccentric.",CORDNER ROBERT ALLEN,CORDNER ROBERT ALLEN,,https://lens.org/141-679-906-113-64X,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
