CHARLES PITT (BARTON STACEY) Ltd. Dec. 21, 1961 [Dec. 23, 1960; Aug. 9, 1961], Nos. 44328/60 and 28769/61. Heading F2E. [Also in Division B7] In a trailer having steerable front wheels, wheel brakes and a draw bar, the latter is mounted for swinging movement about vertical and horizontal axes and is connected to a brake operating device so formed as to cause the brakes to be applied at zones which are spaced apart about the zone of normal vertical swinging movement of the draw bar when coupled to a towing vehicle whereby the brakes can be operated by vertically swinging the draw bar when uncoupled. As shown movement of the draw bar 3 about a vertical pivot 6 is used to apply a steering action on the forward wheels 2 by connecting the steering arms 8 to the rear end of the draw bar through transmission rods 9. The draw bar is also pivoted about the horizontal pivot 7 and carries coaxially therewith a cam 10 engaged by a follower 11 at the end of a pivoted - lever 12. The end of the latter abuts a rod 14 which is free to slide in a bush 15 constituting part of the vertical pivot 6. The lower end of rod 14 abuts a spring biased pivoted lever 16 which is coupled to the rear wheel brakes, and if they are fitted, to the front wheel brakes. The peripheral form of the cam 10 is such that movement of the draw bar through the neutral angle extending from 30 degrees to 90 degrees (see Fig. 4) does not apply the brakes. The operating zone during which the brakes are increasingly applied extends through the angle 0 degrees to 30 degrees and again through 90 degrees to 100 degrees i.e. when the draw bar is swung above or below its normal setting. The brakes are fully applied when the draw bar swings through the angle 340 degrees to 360 degrees and again when the swing is through 100 degrees to 103 degrees. In another embodiment the draw bar is formed longitudinally in two parts, the first part is mounted about the horizontal pivot on a forward extension of the trailer chassis and the second part is longitudinally movable with respect to the first against the force of a compression spring to provide "" over-run "" braking. The cam 10 is carried on the end of the second part and is rotatable about lateral pins which are mounted to slide in longitudinal guides formed in blocks secured to the first part about the horizontal pivot which is formed by stub pivots in horizontal alignment.",CHARLES PITT BARTON STACEY LTD,ANDERSON GEOFFREY BRIAN,,https://lens.org/164-188-860-058-574,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,B60T7/20;;B62D13/04,B60T7/20;;B62D13/04,F2E ENA           ENA;;F2E EP            EPZ;;F2E E3D           EPZ;;F2E E3G           EPZ;;F2E E3J           EPZ;;F2E E3K           EPZ,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A surface plasmon resonance (SPR) probe with a detachable sensor head and system and methods for using the same in various applications is described. The SPR probe couples fiber optic cables directly to an SPR substrate that has a generally planar input surface and a generally curved reflecting surface, such as a substrate formed as a hemisphere. Forming the SPR probe in this manner allows the probe to be miniaturized and operate without the need for high precision, expensive and bulky collimating or focusing optics. Additionally, the curved reflecting surface of the substrate can be coated with one or multiple patches of sensing medium to allow the probe to detect for multiple analytes of interest or to provide multiple readings for comparison and higher precision. Specific applications for the probe are disclosed, including extremely high sensitive relative humidity and dewpoint detection for, e.g., moisture-sensitive environment such as volatile chemical reactions. The SPR probe disclosed operates with a large dynamic range and provides extremely high quality spectra despite being robust enough for field deployment and readily manufacturable.

In an aspect, the present system is adapted to execute a forecasting algorithm to forecast the positions of one or a great many marine vessel(s) based on one or more position reporting systems including coastal and satellite AIS (S-AIS) signals or LRIT received from the vessel. The forecasting algorithm utilizes location and direction information for the vessel, and estimates one or more possible positions based on previous paths taken by vessels from that location, and heading in substantially the same direction. Thus, a body of water can be divided into “bins” of location and direction information, and a spatial index can be built based on the previous paths taken by other vessels after passing through that bin.

    An emergency response system wristwatch having upper and lower case sections connected by a hinge is combined with a removable interference bracket disposed between the two case sections. The upper case section has opposing rear and front surfaces, where the front surface includes a dial face. The upper case section is operable to pivot on the hinge between open and closed positions. The lower case section has an activation button that is exposed when the upper case section is in the open position. When the upper case section is in the closed position, the rear surface of the upper case section is disposed adjacent the activation button. Without the removable interference bracket between the upper and lower case sections, the rear surface of the upper case section is operable to move toward the lower case section and press upon the activation button if pressure is applied to the dial face. Housed within the lower case section is a wireless transmitter that is activated when the rear surface of the upper case section presses the activation button. When activated, the wireless transmitter transmits a wireless emergency signal. When the removable interference bracket is installed between the upper and lower case sections, the bracket prevents the rear surface of the upper case section from pressing the activation button if pressure is applied to the dial face. Thus, the interference bracket prevents accidental activation of the wireless transmitter due to inadvertent pressure upon the dial face.

Thus, a body of water can be divided into “bins” of location and direction information, and a spatial index can be built based on the previous paths taken by other vessels after passing through that bin.

   In a first embodiment of the invention, a method and system of recording successive holograms in a recording medium is presented. The method utilizes a multilayer holographic storage media comprising a reflective substrate layer, a polarization shifting layer disposed above the reflective substrate layer, and a photorecording medium layer disposed above the polarization shifting layer. A reference beam and an encoded object beam are propagated at a first direction to a first area of the photorecording medium layer, where the reference beam and encoded object beam have a same first polarization and interfere to produce a first interference grating. The reference beam and the encoded object beam are reflected with the reflective substrate layer to produce a reflected reference beam and reflected encoded object beam incident the photorecording medium at a second direction, where the reference beam polarization and a encoded object beam polarization are altered with the polarization shifting layer so that the reflected reference beam and reflected encoded object beam have a same second polarization. The reflected reference beam and reflected encoded object beam interfere to produce a second interference grating, with the first polarization and second polarization being different. Successive holograms are recorded by translating the multilayer holographic storage media or reference and object beam along a shift multiplex direction, where the reference beam and object beam are propagated to successive areas of the photorecording medium.

   Multi-stage combustion technology combined with nitrogen-enriched air technology for controlling the combustion temperature and products to extend the maintenance and lifetime cycles of materials in contact with combustion products and to reduce pollutants while maintaining relatively high combustion and thermal cycle efficiencies. The first stage of combustion operates fuel rich where most of the heat of combustion is released by burning it with nitrogen-enriched air. Part of the energy in the combustion gases is used to perform work or to provide heat. The cooled combustion gases are reheated by additional stages of combustion until the last stage is at or near stoichiometric conditions. Additional energy is extracted from each stage to result in relatively high thermal cycle efficiency. The air is enriched with nitrogen using air separation technologies such as diffusion, permeable membrane, absorption, and cryogenics. The combustion method is applicable to many types of combustion equipment, including: boilers, burners, turbines, internal combustion engines, and many types of fuel including hydrogen and carbon-based fuels including methane and coal.

The first stage of combustion operates fuel rich where most of the heat of combustion is released by burning it with nitrogen-enriched air. Part of the energy in the combustion gases is used to perform work or to provide heat. The cooled combustion gases are reheated by additional stages of combustion until the last stage is at or near stoichiometric conditions. Additional energy is extracted from each stage to result in relatively high thermal cycle efficiency. The air is enriched with nitrogen using air separation technologies such as diffusion, permeable membrane, absorption, and cryogenics. The combustion method is applicable to many types of combustion equipment, including: boilers, burners, turbines, internal combustion engines, and many types of fuel including hydrogen and carbon-based fuels including methane and coal.",UNIV CALIFORNIA,FISCHER LARRY E;;ANDERSON BRIAN L,,https://lens.org/087-696-514-823-931,Patent Application,yes,4,0,5,5,0,F02B1/12;;F02M25/00;;F23C6/045;;F23C2900/06041;;F23L7/00;;F23L2900/07002;;F23R3/346;;Y02E20/34;;F23C6/045;;F23C2900/06041;;F23L7/00;;F02M25/00;;F02B1/12;;F23L2900/07002;;F23R3/346;;Y02E20/34,F02B1/12;;F02M25/00;;F23C6/04;;F23L7/00;;F23R3/34,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The condensates are created at two or more different heights in the gravitational potential. de Broglie waves are extracted from each of these condensates and are interfered at detector which is located below the lower condensate. In the same manner as an optical heterodyne experiment, interference of the two ""atom laser beams"" results in a beatnote whose frequency is given by the energy difference associated with each atom laser beam. This beat frequency is given by the frequency difference of the two atom laser beams and is proportional (via Planck's constant) to the energy difference of the interfering beams. This energy difference allows the force of gravity to be derived at a level of sensitivity approaching 10.sup.-14 g (where g is the acceleration due to gravity).",UNIV YALE,KASEVICH MARK A;;ANDERSON BRIAN P,YALE UNIVERSITY (2000-03-24);;UNIVERSITY YALE (2000-01-20),https://lens.org/117-689-920-101-177,Granted Patent,yes,2,29,1,1,0,G01V7/00;;G01V7/00,G01V7/00,73382R,4,4,029-616-286-186-953;;014-698-829-392-903;;012-073-190-194-136;;038-685-732-100-407,10.1103/physrevlett.78.582;;10061309;;10.1103/physrevlett.76.4508;;10.1126/science.275.5300.637;;9005843;;17789847;;10.1126/science.269.5221.198,"""Output Coupler for Bose-Einstein Condensed Atoms"" Mewes et al., Phys.

    A mounting assembly for a rotating arm, such as a control arm of an independent suspension. The mounting assembly includes a pin which passes through a cylindrical bore in one end of the arm. The pin is gripped at each end by a clamping block. Each block has a main pin-gripping opening for one end of the pin, and the opening has an initial size which allows the end of the pin to pass easily through the opening. However, when the clamping block is tightened, such as by mounting the block to a support, the opening is made smaller so as to grip the end of the pin. The arrangement allows easy removal of the pin and therefore easy replacement of the control arm of a vehicle suspension.

    Multi-stage combustion technology combined with nitrogen-enriched air technology for controlling the combustion temperature and products to extend the maintenance and lifetime cycles of materials in contact with combustion products and to reduce pollutants while maintaining relatively high combustion and thermal cycle efficiencies. The first stage of combustion operates fuel rich where most of the heat of combustion is released by burning it with nitrogen-enriched air. Part of the energy in the combustion gases is used to perform work or to provide heat. The cooled combustion gases are reheated by additional stages of combustion until the last stage is at or near stoichiometric conditions. Additional energy is extracted from each stage to result in relatively high thermal cycle efficiency. The air is enriched with nitrogen using air separation technologies such as diffusion, permeable membrane, absorption, and cryogenics. The combustion method is applicable to many types of combustion equipment, including: boilers, burners, turbines, internal combustion engines, and many types of fuel including hydrogen and carbon-based fuels including methane and coal.

   The detection method includes generating a plurality of neural network models. Each model has as a training set a data set from a plurality of samples of a commodity of known origins. Each sample has been analyzed for a plurality of elemental concentrations. Each neural network model is presented for classification a test data set from a plurality of samples of a commodity of unknown origins. As with the training set, the samples have been analyzed for the same plurality of elemental concentrations. Next a bootstrap aggregating strategy is employed to combine the results of the classifications for each sample in the test data set made by each neural network model. Finally, a determination is made from the bootstrap aggregating strategy as to a final classification of each sample in the test data set. This final classification is indicative of the geographical origin of the commodity. The system includes software for generating the neural network models and a software routine for performing the bootstrap aggregating strategy.

The compression is achieved through various confidence modes set up by the transmitter and the receiver. The Initialization and Refresh state (IR) is the first state of the compressor. This provides a complete, uncompressed context of the data that is being transmitted. In typically operation, the ROHC compressor will periodically transmit IR packets providing context information allowing the ROHC decompressor to decompress one or more packets following the IR packet. However, under certain conditions such as decompressor start-up, it is possible for the decompressor to miss an IR packet. Exemplary methods and apparatus are described in which a decompressor uses a later-received IR packet to decompress earlier packets for which the decompressor had not received context information.",THOMSON LICENSING,SRIDHAR AVINASH;;ANDERSON DAVID BRIAN;;CAMPANA DAVID ANTHONY,THOMSON LICENSING DTV (2017-01-13);;INTERDIGITAL MADISON PATENT HOLDINGS (2018-07-23);;THOMSON LICENSING (2015-07-04),https://lens.org/060-135-492-715-525,Granted Patent,yes,11,2,13,13,0,H04L69/28;;H04L69/04;;H04L65/764;;H04L65/65;;H04L69/00;;H04L65/00;;H04L12/56;;H04L69/28;;H04L65/65;;H04L65/70;;H04L65/764;;H04L69/04;;H04L69/22,H04L29/06;;H04B1/707;;H04L12/70;;H04W28/06;;H04W36/00,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

A resource conflict exists when a client version of a resource differs from a server version of the same resource. A resource conflict primarily arises when a client attempts to upload an altered resource to a server where the server version of the resource is no longer equivalent to the version that the client originally downloaded. The conflict is detected by the server and conflict resolution is initiated. The server is the first level of conflict resolution. The server can compare the conflicting versions of the resource to determine if the changes are not actually conflicting. If the server can resolve the conflict, it does and returns a resource tag to the client. The second level of conflict resolution is at the client. The client typically has knowledge of a schema related to the resource which may enable the client to resolve conflicts that the server could not. If the neither the server of the client can resolve the conflict, an end user is needed to resolve the conflict. After the conflict is resolved, it is uploaded to the server and the client receives a new resource tag.",MICROSOFT CORP,HOPMANN ALEXANDER I;;ANDERSON BECKY;;DEEN BRIAN J,MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (1999-11-22),https://lens.org/084-232-017-681-157,Granted Patent,yes,20,58,1,1,0,G06F16/1787;;G06F16/1787;;G06F16/00;;G06F16/00;;G06F16/1734;;G06F16/1734;;G06F16/1767;;G06F16/1767;;G06F16/2329;;G06F16/2329,G06F15/16,709/203;;718/104,7,4,015-012-481-923-001;;068-593-173-328-826;;109-261-141-855-802;;022-733-441-001-17X,10.17487/rfc1521;;10.17487/rfc2068;;10.17487/rfc2291;;10.17487/rfc2518,"Borenstein, et al., RFC 1521, ""MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the Format of Internet Message Bodies,"" Sep. 1993.;;Fielding, et al., RFC 2068, ""Hypertext Transfer Protocol-HTTP/1.1,"" Jan. 1997.;;Slein, et al., RFC 2291, ""Requirements for a Distributed Authoring and Versioning Protocol For the World Wide Web,"" Feb. 1998.;;Goland, et al., RFC 2518, ""HTTP Extensions for Distributed Authoring-WEBDAV,"" Feb. 1999.;;Fielding, et al., RFC 2616, ""Hypertext Transfer Protocol-HTTP/1.1,"" Jun. 1999.;;Yavin, D., ""Replication's Fast Track,"" BYTE, Aug. 1995, pp. 88a-88d, 90.;;Martin, J., ""Design and Strategy for Distributed Data Processing,"" Prentice Hall, Inc., pp. 272-305, 1981.",EXPIRED

    A device for controlling the direction of flow of a primary fluid includes one or more injectors oriented to inject a secondary fluid against the direction of flow of the primary fluid. The injector is formed by drilling or otherwise forming a hole at an angle to the surface of one or more sidewalls of an engine nozzle or other device. A feedback controller regulates the amount and duration of the secondary fluid injection to achieve the commanded attitude or attitude rate. The controller is coupled to one or more plenums attached to the sidewall(s). The plenums can be arranged to deliver secondary fluid to one or more of the injectors. Secondary fluid delivery to each plenum can be controlled independently to control the flow of the primary fluid in one or more directions. The device can be used to provide thrust vectoring in an aircraft or other type of vehicle, as well as other applications where it is desired to control the direction of a primary fluid.

These methods and systems include generating a coherent light beam that is a reproduction of the reference beam used in storing the holographic information in the storage medium. This coherent light beam is then directed through the holographic storage medium at the same angle and location of the reference beam during recording of the hologram. The directed coherent beam is then reflected back through the storage medium so that the reflected coherent light beam provides a phase conjugate of the reference beam and passes through the storage medium at the same angle and location that the reference beam passed through the storage medium during recordation of the hologram.,INPHASE TECH INC,RILEY BRIAN;;ANDERSON KEN E;;CURTIS KEVIN R,ACADIA WOODS PARTNERS LLC (2012-03-07);;AKONIA HOLOGRAPHICS LLC (2012-08-10);;INPHASE TECHNOLOGIES INC (2006-11-20),https://lens.org/166-753-564-257-562,Patent Application,yes,65,39,2,26,0,G03H1/22;;G03H2222/56;;G11B7/0065;;G11B7/0065;;G03H1/22;;G03H2222/56,G03H1/26,359/22,0,0,,,,INACTIVE
