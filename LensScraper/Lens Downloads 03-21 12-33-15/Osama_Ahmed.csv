According to the method, a noise variance for a particular NMR signal is calculated and the NMR signal is sampled and digitized. A set of analysis samples that vary in the number of samples in frequency is selected so that each member of the set has a compact signal/image representation for at least one component according to the differing component relaxation times of the signal/image. Each member of the set is then processed by the SLTF to determine the transform coefficients, the coefficients are subjected to threshold value criteria to denoise the coefficients, and the inverse SLTF transform is computed for each member of the set to obtain the denoised signal. The member signals are then averaged to obtain the denoised NMR signal.",UNIV KING FAHD PET & MINERALS,AHMED OSAMA ABDEL-WAHHAB,KING FAHD UNIV.

A large diameter Generator unite transfers the working fluid from heat exchanger to coolant or to any other application needed after, and the other two smaller units one of them is called the ""Pump"" 2 and the other is the ""Feeder"" 3, in which the Pump compresses and transfers the working fluid from the Feeder to the heat exchanger while the Feeder is transferring the working fluid from coolant or the fresh air to the Pump. The Pump and Feeder have the same shape and diameter which is smaller than the Generator but the Feeder height is larger than the Pump. Each unit consists of fixed and rotatory part. The cylindrical fixed part consists of 3 walls in a C-shape surrounding the rotor body which is settled inside, forming together a closed hollow tube area, in which the working fluid is transferred from unit to another. When the heat exchanger is exposed to the heat source the working fluid expands and presses on the Generator Grooves as well as the adjacent active blades in the Pump rotor. Due to the difference in rotor radius which is higher in the Generator than the Pump rotor that in turn rotates in the Generator direction leads to exit of the working fluid from the heat exchanger to the coolant. In the same time forcing the Feeder and Pump to run in the same direction resulting in feeding a new volume of the working fluid from coolant, getting compressed by the Pump, heated in the heat exchanger and getting out to coolant again via the Generator and so on.",EL-TOOKHY OSAMA MOHAMED SALAH EL DIN AHMED,EL-TOOKHY OSAMA MOHAMED SALAH EL DIN AHMED,,https://lens.org/126-114-950-509-666,Patent Application,yes,4,1,1,1,0,F02G1/043;;F01C1/3441;;F01C11/004;;F02G2270/10,F02G1/043,,0,0,,,,PENDING

A multiphase selector can identify the one of the clock output signals that has the respective phase that is closest to the phase of the tag input signal and is best suited for sampling the peak of the tag input signal, accordingly.

Tree nodes and leaves are uniformly sampled at random to estimate the corresponding work (such as node counts and leave work). This is done through novel uniform node sample and weighted random depth probing. A linear workload mapping then maps subtrees into sub-intervals of a one-dimensional interval. Such mapping facilities inverse mapping of the estimated workload to achieve efficient partitioning of the tree. The process further adaptively decides upon subtrees to sample allowing for matching with the characteristics of input trees, decreasing the number of probes, while resulting in accurate load-balancing. The process provides for fast load balancing for complex tree-based applications by exploiting statistical random sampling and requires only modest memory resources for such process making it suitable and applicable to even modest embedded devices.
