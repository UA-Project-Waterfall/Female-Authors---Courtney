This is no problem under normal conditions. However, when it is desired to operate a wind generator at a relatively low wind speed, then this lock-up becomes important. Also, a small wind operated generator can reach excessive tip speeds in high wind conditions and if icing is a problem in the area where the generator is located, the centrifugal force can cause a severe vibration condition due to imbalance. The present generator utilizes a permanent magnet in the rotor and has the rotor flux field arranged at an angle relative to the stator pole faces, thereby reducing the lock-up torque in order to allow rotation to commence at relatively low wind speeds of, for example, 3 and 5 m.p.h. Furthermore, the braking effect of the generator holds down the tip speed of the fan so that the efficiency drops off thereby resulting in a smaller generator in order to obtain control of the fan speed above the rated r.p.m. thereof.",ANDREWS BRIAN,ANDREWS BRIAN,,https://lens.org/070-698-998-617-473,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,H02K1/2753;;H02K7/183;;H02K2201/06;;F03D9/25;;Y02E10/72;;F03D9/25,F03D9/25;;H02K1/27;;H02K7/18,322-34,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A conventional blade is of prismatic form with an aerofoil cross-section and extends radially between annular end blocks. The inventive blade is curved in the radial (height) direction, being convex from root to tip on its pressure face. The setting angle relative to the corresponding prismatic blade is therefore fine at the root and tip and coarse at the blade mid-height. The throat opening is thus reduced at root and tip and increased at mid-height so displacing some mass flow away from both lossy end wall regions. A considerable gain in the stage efficiency results.

    An object-based security framework provides automatic caller chain building to track the identity of upstream callers. An application developer can define impersonation settings declaratively using a graphical interface. At runtime, logic outside the application objects handles the caller chain and impersonation, relieving the developer from having to incorporate impersonation logic into the application. A group of special identities are permitted to provide identities of others without themselves being recorded in the chain when the chain traverses a method invocation queue. The framework supports a copy style for the chain to support various caller scenarios. Additionally, a minimum authentication level can be enforced throughout the chain. The caller chain can be used in conjunction with roles, and objects may consult the chain programmatically to enforce a custom security scheme.

The continuous path is discretized into geometric moves, pairs of which are preferably joined to minimize positioner stop and go. Ranges of velocities are analyzed for each discrete move and are adjusted to overlap for fitting a continuous velocity curve therethrough. Optimizing of the velocity ranges for maximum tool acceleration and velocity results in a time-optimized velocity profile for the tool. Velocity profiles for each discrete move are further optimized to maximize acceleration and deceleration resulting in the most time spent at maximum velocity. Throughout, the method is cognizant of the effects of time and displacement being measured in integer increments. Rounding is appropriately performed and move parameters are adjusted appropriately. Apparatus (2) capable of responding to such optimized control comprises parallel X-rails (X1, X2) and a gantry, each end of the gantry being independently driven. Bearings permit the gantry to pivot, resulting translation being accepted by another bearing at one of the ends.

    An object-based security framework provides automatic caller chain building to track the identity of upstream callers. An application developer can define impersonation settings declaratively using a graphical interface. At runtime, logic outside the application objects handles the caller chain and impersonation, relieving the developer from having to incorporate impersonation logic into the application. A group of special identities are permitted to provide identities of others without themselves being recorded in the chain when the chain traverses a method invocation queue. The framework supports a copy style for the chain to support various caller scenarios. Additionally, a minimum authentication level can be enforced throughout the chain. The caller chain can be used in conjunction with roles, and objects may consult the chain programmatically to enforce a custom security scheme.

A load sensor (1) positioned beneath the patient senses movement, each movement greater than a predetermined threshold being accumulated in a counter (4). The accumulated number is continuously compared in a comparator (5) with a preset number. In the monitor state if the accumulated number does not equal or exceed the preset number within a predetermined time, the comparator (5) produces an output signal which enables a flip-flop (7) and an alarm (3) and puts the apparatus into an alarm state. In the alarm state when a predetermined time has elapsed, say 10 minutes, and a push- up of a predetermined time has not been performed, the alarm is actuated. Each time the patient does a push-up of the required time the alarm is postponed for 10 minutes. At the end of the monitor period if the accumulated pressure relief time in the memory is still insufficient, the timer is reset in the alarm mode, if the accumulated pressure relief time is sufficient the timer is reset to the monitor mode. <IMAGE>",UNIV STRATHCLYDE,BAR CHRISTOPHER ANTHONY;;ANDREWS BRIAN;;FERGUSON-PELL MARTIN WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/107-625-099-984-513,Patent Application,no,0,16,2,5,0,A61G5/1043;;A61B5/1118;;A61B5/447;;A61G7/057;;A61G2203/32;;A61G2203/34;;A61G2203/36;;A61G2203/44;;A63B23/0244;;A63B2208/0233;;A63B2220/17;;G08B21/0446;;G08B21/0461,A61B5/11;;A61G7/057;;A63B23/02;;A63B24/00;;G08B21/04,G4N NCA           NCE;;G4N NHSX          NHSX;;G4N N1P           NCE;;G4N N4E           NCE;;G4N N4J           NCE;;G4N N4S           NCE;;G4N N5A           NCE;;G4N N6E           NCE;;U1S S2189,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The invention recognizes an optimum fillet radius in the range 0.15-0.3 of the throat dimension between the trailing edge of one blade and the suction surface of an adjacent blade, and more particularly 0.20-0.50. The fillet configuration is advantageously applied to a turbine having blades which are of constant cross-section, are curved in the radial (height) direction and are convex from root to tip on its pressure face, the result being a considerable gain in stage efficiency.",GEC ALSTHOM LTD,HALLER BRIAN ROBERT;;HALL DAVID MORETON;;ANDREWS VICCARS JEREMY,ALSTOM TECHNOLOGY LTD (2012-11-23);;ALSTOM UK LTD (1995-09-14),https://lens.org/150-993-146-941-419,Granted Patent,yes,4,18,24,27,0,F01D9/02;;F01D9/02;;F01D5/141;;F01D5/141;;F01D5/145;;F01D5/145;;F05D2230/12;;F05D2230/12;;F05D2250/16;;F05D2250/16;;Y02T50/60;;Y02T50/60;;Y10S415/914;;Y10S415/914,F01D5/14;;F01D9/02,415/191;;415/208.1,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The inventive blade is curved in the radial (height) direction, being convex from root (35) to tip (37) on its pressure face (26). The setting angle relative to the corresponding prismatic blade is therefore fine at the root and tip and coarse at the blade mid-height. The throat opening is thus reduced at root and tip and increased at mid-height so displacing some mass flow away from both lossy end wall regions. A considerable gain in the stage efficiency results.

The inventive blade is curved in the radial (height) direction, being convex from root (35) to tip (37) on its pressure face (26). The setting angle relative to the corresponding prismatic blade is therefore fine at the root and tip and coarse at the blade mid-height. The throat opening is thus reduced at root and tip and increased at mid-height so displacing some mass flow away from both lossy end wall regions. A considerable gain in the stage efficiency results.

   A system for criticality incident detection is described. The system comprises a plurality of sensors at least partially comprised of storage phosphors. The sensors are distributed throughout the environment to be monitored. The sensors are coupled to a central detection system comprised of at least a luminescence detector and a processor. The luminescence detector measures the luminance of the sensors and provides that measurement to the processor. The processor then calculates the radiation level that the luminance measurement corresponds to. In other embodiments, monitoring units are installed in various portions of the environment being monitored. The monitoring units accept the sensors and are coupled to the central detection system so that the remote monitoring units can be interrogated from the central detection system.

The GUI scheduler program includes tools to allow a user to create a schedule for business workflow processes based on a set of rules defined by the GUI scheduler program. The rules facilitate deadlock not occurring within the schedule. The program provides tools for creating and defining message flows between entities. Additionally, the program provides tools that allow a user to define a binding between the schedule and components, such as COM components, script components, message queues and other workflow schedules. The scheduler program allows a user to define actions and group actions into transactions using simple GUI scheduling tools. The schedule can then be converted to executable code in a variety of forms such as XML, C, C+ and C++.
