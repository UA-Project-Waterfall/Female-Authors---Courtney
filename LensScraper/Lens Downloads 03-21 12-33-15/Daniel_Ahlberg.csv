A molten gel of LDPE having a high molding temperature is poured or injected into the mold cavity. The tack-free gel is then formed as a thin layer of plastic of the mold cavity is melted over the gel. The process may further include the step of dabbing the gel in a low-friction powder such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and a lubricant. The tack-free gel provides an elongation or stretch as great as 1500 percent and is therefore ideally suited to form a zero seal.,APPLIED MED RESOURCES;;AHLBERG RUSSELL E;;ADLPARVAR PAYAM;;TAYLOR SCOTT V;;WIXEY MATTHEW A;;MARTINEZ DANIEL;;BRUSTAD JOHN R,AHLBERG RUSSELL E;;ADLPARVAR PAYAM;;TAYLOR SCOTT V;;WIXEY MATTHEW A;;MARTINEZ DANIEL;;BRUSTAD JOHN R,,https://lens.org/131-369-555-481-670,Patent Application,yes,0,11,13,13,0,A61B17/3423;;A61B17/3462;;A61B17/3498;;A61B2017/00469;;A61B2017/22067;;B29C37/0067;;B29C39/006;;B29C39/025;;B29C39/123;;A61B17/3423;;A61B17/3462;;A61B17/3498;;A61B2017/00469;;A61B2017/22067;;B29C37/0067;;B29C39/006;;B29C39/025;;B29C39/123;;A61M3/0279,A61B17/00;;A61B17/22;;A61B17/34;;B29C39/00;;B29C39/12,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Each of the outer wall and the inner wall have an edge defining an open face of the fluid chamber and the low pressure chamber. An ablative element is contained within the fluid chamber. A source of low pressure is coupled to the low pressure chamber. When the edge of the outer wall and the edge of the inner wall contact a surface, the ablation device is at least partially secured to the surface by low pressure created in the low pressure chamber by the source of low pressure. The fluid chamber is at least partially fluidly isolated from the low pressure chamber when the ablation device is at least partially secured to the surface.",MEDTRONIC INC;;AHLBERG SARAH E;;DAIGLE TOM P;;FRANCISCHELLI DAVID E;;PODBELSKI ADAM A;;HAEG DANIEL C;;ROTHSTEIN PAUL T;;RAMBERG STEVE V;;BATCHELOR KESTER J;;CONWAY THOMAS J,AHLBERG SARAH E;;DAIGLE TOM P;;FRANCISCHELLI DAVID E;;PODBELSKI ADAM A;;HAEG DANIEL C;;ROTHSTEIN PAUL T;;RAMBERG STEVE V;;BATCHELOR KESTER J;;CONWAY THOMAS J,,https://lens.org/017-714-266-504-911,Patent Application,yes,2,2,3,3,0,A61B18/1492;;A61B2018/00065;;A61B2018/00113;;A61B2018/00291;;A61B2018/00351;;A61B2018/00642;;A61B2018/00702;;A61B2018/00726;;A61B2018/00863;;A61B2018/1472;;A61B2218/002;;A61B2218/007;;A61B2090/064;;A61B18/1492;;A61B2018/00291;;A61B2018/00702;;A61B2018/00113;;A61B2018/00726;;A61B2018/00642;;A61B2018/00351;;A61B2018/00065;;A61B2018/1472;;A61B2018/00863;;A61B2218/002;;A61B2218/007;;A61B2090/064,A61B8/14,,0,0,,,,PENDING
