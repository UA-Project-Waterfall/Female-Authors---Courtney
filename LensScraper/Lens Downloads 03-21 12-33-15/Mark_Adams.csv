A first switch alternately connects and disconnects a DC voltage source to one side of the primary winding of the transformer of a power converter. A second switch is connected between the other side of the primary winding and ground. A switch controller is responsive to the difference between a reference voltage and the voltage level present at the output of the circuit associated with the secondary winding of the transformer. Energy is added to the circuit while the first and second switches are closed. The first switch is then opened and energy is held in the circuit for a variable period of time to delay the beginning of resonance. Finally, both switches are opened and the energy within the circuit resonates. The energy holding period is adjusted as necessary to maintain a fixed frequency with varying loads. Accordingly, the switch controller is configured to open and close the first and second switches to maintain fixed-frequency operation of the power converter and switching of the second switch under zero-voltage conditions and in the presence of varying loads.",ELDEC CORP,ADAMS MARK,ELDEC CORPORATION (1998-01-06),https://lens.org/180-778-165-772-442,Granted Patent,yes,23,38,1,1,0,H02M3/33569;;Y02B70/10;;H02M3/01;;H02M3/33569;;Y02B70/10;;H02M3/01,H02M3/335,363/21;;363/97,13,11,123-435-691-125-630;;051-573-005-763-823;;013-507-326-714-770;;097-639-235-915-886;;069-025-973-604-818;;010-999-974-383-927;;121-256-494-162-778;;010-999-974-383-927;;058-966-443-690-320;;028-662-907-454-65X;;044-728-321-626-396,10.1109/pesc.1996.548590;;10.1049/ip-epa:19960437;;10.1109/pedes.1996.537299;;10.1109/apec.1995.469064;;10.1109/pesc.1993.471906;;10.1049/cp:19941045;;10.1109/7.366299;;10.1049/cp:19941045;;10.1109/ias.1993.299032;;10.1007/bf01578536;;10.1109/apec.1992.228404,"Belaguli et al., Analysis and Design of Hybrid Parallel Series Resonant Converter, 27th Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference, vol. 1, pp. 259 265, 1996.

Scientific feasibility is established by studying the behavior of nuclear fuels in configurations designed to support a fission chain reaction. Nanofuel is defined as nuclear fuel suitable for use in an internal engine, comprised of six essential ingredients, and can be created from clean fuel or from the transuranic elements found in light-water reactor spent nuclear fuel in a proliferation resistant manner. Three essential ingredients ensure the nanofuel is inherently stable, due to a negative temperature coefficient of reactivity. Reciprocating and Wankel (rotary) internal engine configurations, which operate in an Otto cycle, are adapted to support a fission chain reaction. Dynamic engine cores experience a decrease in criticality as the engine piston or rotor moves away from the top dead center position. In this inherent safety feature, the increase in engine core volume decreases the nanofuel density and increases the neutron leakage. Technological feasibility is demonstrated by examining potential engineering limitations. The nanofuel internal engine can be operated in two modes: spark-ignition with an external neutron source such as a fusion neutron generator; and compression-ignition with an internal neutron source. The structural integrity can be maintained using standard internal combustion engine design and operation practices. The fuel system can be operated in a closed thermodynamic cycle, which allows for complete fuel utilization, continuous refueling, and easy fission product extraction. Nanofuel engine power plant configurations offer favorable economic, safety, and waste management attributes when compared to existing power generation technology. The initial (first-of-a-kind) overnight capital cost is approximately $400 per kilowatt-electric. Obvious safety features include an underground installation, autonomous operation, and an ultra-low nuclear material inventory.",GLOBAL ENERGY RES ASS LLC,ADAMS MARK LLOYD,GLOBAL ENERGY RESEARCH ASSOCIATES LLC (2017-01-23),https://lens.org/020-491-916-896-447,Patent Application,yes,0,1,2,15,0,B64G1/408;;G21C1/32;;G21C3/42;;G21C19/42;;G21C3/44;;G21D5/02;;G21C5/12;;F02B37/00;;Y02E30/30;;Y02T10/12;;Y02E30/00;;G21D5/02;;F02B53/02;;F02B53/12;;F02B53/10;;F02B55/14;;F02P23/04;;G21C5/12;;F02B2053/005;;F02B37/00;;B64G1/408;;G21C1/32;;G21C3/42;;G21C19/42;;G21C3/44;;Y02E30/30;;Y02T10/12;;B63G8/08,G21D5/02;;F02B53/02;;F02B53/10;;F02B53/12;;F02B55/14;;F02P23/04;;G21C5/12,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Scientific feasibility is established by studying the behavior of nuclear fuels in configurations designed to support a fission chain reaction. Nanofuel is defined as nuclear fuel suitable for use in an internal engine, comprised of six essential ingredients, and can be created from clean fuel or from the transuranic elements found in light-water reactor spent nuclear fuel in a proliferation resistant manner. Three essential ingredients ensure the nanofuel is inherently stable, due to a negative temperature coefficient of reactivity. Reciprocating and Wankel (rotary) internal engine configurations, which operate in an Otto cycle, are adapted to support a fission chain reaction. Dynamic engine cores experience a decrease in criticality as the engine piston or rotor moves away from the top dead center position. In this inherent safety feature, the increase in engine core volume decreases the nanofuel density and increases the neutron leakage. Technological feasibility is demonstrated by examining potential engineering limitations. The nanofuel internal engine can be operated in two modes: spark-ignition with an external neutron source such as a fusion neutron generator; and compression-ignition with an internal neutron source. The structural integrity can be maintained using standard internal combustion engine design and operation practices. The fuel system can be operated in a closed thermodynamic cycle, which allows for complete fuel utilization, continuous refueling, and easy fission product extraction. Nanofuel engine power plant configurations offer favorable economic, safety, and waste management attributes when compared to existing power generation technology. The initial (first-of-a-kind) overnight capital cost is approximately $400 per kilowatt-electric.

   According to the invention semiconductor processing procedures can be applied to silicone elastomeric materials. The surface tension of the elastomeric material is changed by depositing a thin layer of silicon, silicon nitride, silicon dioxide or a combination thereof onto the elastomer's exposed surface. In the illustrated embodiment it is shown that it is possible to deposit a thin layer of silicon dioxide onto the elastomer's exposed surface through re*active sputter deposition of silicon dioxide within an argon-oxygen plasma. In another plasma fabrication procedure, the elastomer material is directionally etched using a standard RF plasma etching system and a dry chemical oxygen-Freon removal procedure, which procedure volatilizes all of the components of the polydimethylsilicone (PDMS) or GE's RTV elastomer material.

In such an arrangement, light (130) passing through the ridge (118) of material continues in a straight path (134) and does not converge at a focal point (140). Alternatively, surface deformations, such as grooves circular ridges, dimples, and roughing, may be provided on the exterior surface of the suction cup.

A ridge (118) of material is provided along the outer portion of the exterior surface, so that, when the suction cup is in a sealing position, the ridge of material is generally parallel to the mounted surface. In such an arrangement, light (130) passing through the ridge (118) of material continues in a straight path (134) and does not converge at a focal point (140). Alternatively, surface deformations, such as grooves circular ridges, dimples, and roughing, may be provided on the exterior surface of the suction cup.

The transistor stage (54) closest to the sense resistor (RS) is referred to as a current gain stage (54), and all the other transistor stages (52a, 52b. . . 52n) are referred to as component stages (52a, 52b. . . 52n).

As each transistor stage (52a, 52b. . . 52n) enters conduction, the resulting voltage drop will cause each corresponding blocking diode (DD) to avalanche, allowing current to flow. Eventually, all of the component stages (52a, 52b. . . 52n) are turned on, creating a conductive path through the stages (52a, 52b. . . 52n) and completing the switching of the switching circuit (50).",ELDEC CORP,COOPER JAMES L;;ADAMS MARK,ELDEC CORPORATION (1999-04-21),https://lens.org/122-061-909-277-371,Granted Patent,yes,17,27,1,1,0,H02M1/088;;H03K17/102;;H02M1/088;;H03K17/102,H02M1/088;;H03K17/10,307/125;;307/139;;323/282;;361/56;;361/234,2,1,073-495-646-325-556,10.1117/12.209736,"Cuthbert, D., HV Crowbar Switches 2.4 MW, Electronic Design , Sep. 12, 1991, p. 144.;;Cooper, J. et al., A Solid State High Voltage Crowbar Device Applicable to Helmet Mounted Display Rapid Disconnection, reprinted from Helmet and Head Mounted Displays and Symbology Design Requirements II , Proc.

The regulator circuit may be coupled to the generator in either a series or a shunt configuration. In the shunt configuration, the regulator circuit (10) varies the amount of current through a shunt resistor (R1) to change the output voltage provided to a load. The amount of current that is shunted by the regulator circuit is controlled by a feedback circuit consisting of a voltage divider (20) and an error amplifier (22). In the series configuration, the voltage across the regulator circuit (50) is added to the output from the high voltage generator.

    The specification and drawings describe and show an embodiment of and method of forming a liquid flow through heat exchanger structure cast in a metal matrix composite. The composite comprises a preform reinforcement material infiltrated with molten metal. The composite reinforcement material is injection molded around the heat exchanger structure allowing for intimate contact between the composite and structure. The composite formed has a specific coefficient of thermal expansion to match an active heat-generating device mounted thereon. The present invention allows for enhanced thermal and mechanical properties by eliminating voids or gaps at the composite to heat exchanger structure interface, these voids or gaps being present in prior art fabrication methods or induced by usage due to thermal cycling of prior art composites. It is emphasized that this abstract is provided to comply with the rules requiring an abstract, which will allow a searcher or other reader to quickly ascertain the subject matter of the technical disclosure. It is submitted with the understanding that it will not be used to interpret or limit the scope or meaning of the claims. 37 CFR 1.72(b).

   The specification and drawings describe and show an embodiment of and method of forming a liquid flow through heat exchanger structure cast in a metal matrix composite. The composite comprises a preform reinforcement material infiltrated with molten metal. The composite reinforcement material is injection molded around the heat exchanger structure allowing for intimate contact between the composite and structure. The composite formed has a specific coefficient of thermal expansion to match an active heat-generating device mounted thereon. The present invention allows for enhanced thermal and mechanical properties by eliminating voids or gaps at the composite to heat exchanger structure interface, these voids or gaps being present in prior art fabrication methods or induced by usage due to thermal cycling of prior art composites.

    The specification and drawings describe and show an embodiment of and method of forming a liquid flow through heat exchanger structure cast in a metal matrix composite. The composite comprises a preform reinforcement material infiltrated with molten metal. The composite reinforcement material is injection molded around the heat exchanger structure allowing for intimate contact between the composite and structure. The composite formed has a specific coefficient of thermal expansion to match active heat-generating device(s) mounted thereon. The present invention allows for enhanced thermal and mechanical properties by eliminating voids or gaps at the composite to heat exchanger structure interface, these voids or gaps being present in prior art fabrication methods or induced by usage due to thermal cycling of prior art composites.

As a result, the initial stored energy requirements of the prophylactic ICD system are less than about 12,000 joules, and both the battery and the capacitor systems can be significantly smaller than existing ICD system. The smaller battery and capacitor systems produce in an implantable device having a physical size small enough to permit implantation of the device in the pectoral region. By using the particular ranges of number of shocks and maximum energy value for each shock to design the ICD system, the result is a practical prophylactic ICD system that will provide effective prophylactic therapy for prospective cardiac incidents in patients with less severe cardiac conditions.",ANGEION CORP,ADAMS THEODORE P;;KROLL MARK W,ANGEION CORPORATION (1993-09-23),https://lens.org/129-527-367-086-576,Granted Patent,yes,5,138,5,5,0,A61N1/3912;;A61N1/3956;;A61N1/3975;;H01M6/5016;;H01M16/00;;A61N1/3975;;H01M16/00;;H01M6/5016;;A61N1/3912;;A61N1/3956,A61N1/39;;H01M2/10;;H01M6/50;;H01M16/00,607/5;;607/36,4,3,027-770-179-933-266;;004-618-974-035-739;;011-703-661-728-999,5454169;;10.1016/0002-8703(84)90762-2;;6388295;;6749205;;10.1056/nejm198408233110801,"Schuder et al Experimental Ventricular Defibrillation with an Automatic and Completely Implanted System vol.

According to the present state of the art, endoscopic cannulation of the common bile duct and papillotomy and similar procedures are accomplished by advancing the device into an endoscope/duodenoscope so that the distal tip of the device exits the endoscope adjacent the sphincter muscles at the Papilla of Vater. The endoscope mechanisms are then manipulated to orient the distal tip of the device to the desired position for proper cannulation of the duct. Due to inconsistencies in, for example, the sphincterotome, anatomy, and endoscope manipulation, it is difficult to accurately and consistently position the sphincterotome for proper cannulation. The steerable sphincterotome of the present invention allows the physician to control the position of the distal tip of the device independently of the endoscope and adjust for inconsistencies in the device and the anatomy. According to the present invention, the handle to which the cutting wire is attached is freely rotatable relative to the catheter. The handle, secured to the cutting wire but rotatable relative to the shaft of the catheter, provides a mechanism to rotate the wire, transmitting the force to rotate the device tip. With the handle rotating independently of the shaft at the proximal end, the force can be applied directly to the distal tip without twisting the entire shaft. Also a rotation lock to maintain the orientation of the tip and/or a rotation marking, to indicate the amount of rotation may be included.",BOSTON SCIENT LTD,HUTCHINS JOHN E;;ADAMS MARK L,"BOSTON SCIENTIFIC LIMITED, BM (2015-02-02);;BOSTON SCIENTIFIC LIMITED (2004-01-21)",https://lens.org/047-149-211-588-352,Granted Patent,yes,4,0,13,13,0,A61B18/1492;;A61B2017/003;;A61B2017/0046;;A61B2017/22038;;A61B2017/22067;;A61B2018/00535;;A61B2018/00553;;A61B2018/1253;;A61B2018/1407;;A61B2018/144;;A61B2018/1861;;A61B2218/002;;A61M25/0136;;A61M25/0136;;A61B2018/00553;;A61B2017/0046;;A61B2218/002;;A61B2017/22038;;A61B2017/003;;A61B2017/22067;;A61B18/1492;;A61B2018/1407;;A61B2018/144;;A61B2018/00535;;A61B2018/1253;;A61B2018/1861,A61B17/32;;A61B17/00;;A61B18/14;;A61M25/01,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Unlike existing ICD systems, the prophylactic ICD (17) is designed to deliver between about 100 to 200 shocks, with each shock having a maximum delivered energy value of only about 25 joules. As a result, the initial stored energy requirements of the prophylactic ICD system (17) are less than about 12,000 joules, and both the battery (28) and the capacitor systems (26, 27) can be significantly smaller than existing ICD system. The smaller battery (28) and capacitor systems (26, 27) produce in an implantable device having a physical size small enough to permit implantation of the device in the pectoral region.

According to the present state of the art, endoscopic cannulation of the common bile duct and papillotomy and similar procedures are accomplished by advancing the device into an endoscope/duodenoscope so that the distal tip of the device exits the endoscope adjacent the sphincter muscles at the Papilla of Vater. The endoscope mechanisms are then manipulated to orient the distal tip of the device to the desired position for proper cannulation of the duct. Due to inconsistencies in, for example, the sphincterotome, anatomy, and endoscope manipulation, it is difficult to accurately and consistently position the sphincterotome for proper cannulation. The steerable sphincterotome of the present invention allows the physician to control the position of the distal tip of the device independently of the endoscope and adjust for inconsistencies in the device and the anatomy. According to the present invention, the handle to which the cutting wire is attached is freely rotatable relative to the catheter. The handle, secured to the cutting wire but rotatable relative to the shaft of the catheter, provides a mechanism to rotate the wire, transmitting the force to rotate the device tip. With the handle rotating independently of the shaft at the proximal end, the force can be applied directly to the distal tip without twisting the entire shaft. Also a rotation lock to maintain the orientation of the tip and/or a rotation marking, to indicate the amount of rotation may be included.",HUTCHINS JOHN E;;ADAMS MARK L,HUTCHINS JOHN E;;ADAMS MARK L,,https://lens.org/132-929-922-749-915,Patent Application,yes,5,8,13,13,0,A61B18/1492;;A61B2017/003;;A61B2017/0046;;A61B2017/22038;;A61B2017/22067;;A61B2018/00535;;A61B2018/00553;;A61B2018/1253;;A61B2018/1407;;A61B2018/144;;A61B2018/1861;;A61B2218/002;;A61M25/0136;;A61M25/0136;;A61B2018/00553;;A61B2017/0046;;A61B2218/002;;A61B2017/22038;;A61B2017/003;;A61B2017/22067;;A61B18/1492;;A61B2018/1407;;A61B2018/144;;A61B2018/00535;;A61B2018/1253;;A61B2018/1861,A61B17/00;;A61B17/32;;A61B18/14;;A61M25/01,606/167,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

These are usually biphasic waveforms, or waveforms exhibiting a positive pulse followed immediately by a negative pulse. Examples of the discharge-process possibilities are those of two capacitors in parallel, two in series, two in sequence, or a capacitor or capacitors with polarity inverted. Adding capacitors and switches expands the range of possibilities and provides waveforms ""tailoring"" under the guidance of a switching network that can be digitally programmed from an external programming console, much as in the digital programming of a pacemaker system. Digital signals are transmitted to the implanted system using infrared, visible, RF electromagnetic radiation, or ultrasound radiation. The use of multiple capacitors rather than just a single capacitor makes it possible to pack the components more densely, and in the case of some waveforms, to use less total capacitance than in the prior art, both factors contributing to very desirable size reduction for the implantable defibrillator.

In one preferred embodiment a long-duration, low-voltage pretreatment pulse is generated directly by battery and voltage-conversion circuitry, and is followed by the defibrillation pulse delivered from the previously charged capacitor. In variations on the embodiments, the capacitor is charged during the pretreatment pulse, or between the pretreatment and defibrillation pulses. In other embodiments, pretreatment includes a train of pulses of appreciably lower energy than the defibrillation pulse, and with inter-pulse time adjusted so that necessary capacitor recharging can be accomplished, so that the same capacitor (a component of dominant size) can be used for all pretreatment pulses and for the defibrillation pulse as well.

The same electrodes are employed for both pretreatment and defibrillation. In one preferred embodiment a long-duration, low-voltage pretreatment pulse is generated directly by battery and voltage-conversion circuitry, and is followed by the defibrillation pulse delivered from the previously charged capacitor. In variations on this embodiment, the capacitor is charged during the pretreatment pulse, or between the pretreatment and defibrillation pulses. In other preferred embodiments, pretreatment consists of a train of pulses of appreciably lower energy than the defibrillation pulse, and with inter-pulse time adjusted so that necessary capacitor recharging can be accomplished, so that the same capacitor (a component of dominant size) can be used for all pretreatment pulses and for the defibrillation pulse as well.

As there is little to no risk in overcharging electrolytic capacitors for delivering the overcharged final countershock, and in fact the added electrical energy may overcome the increasing resistance to electrical countershock therapy, the present invention can deliver a more efficacious programmed therapy regimen than is available on existing ICD systems.",ANGEION CORP,ADAMS THEODORE P;;KROLL MARK W,ANGEION CORPORATION (1993-09-21);;ELA MEDICAL S.A (2005-06-30),https://lens.org/057-836-435-036-327,Granted Patent,yes,10,18,1,12,0,A61N1/3906;;A61N1/3956;;Y02E60/10;;A61N1/3956;;A61N1/3906,A61N1/39;;H01M2/10,607/7,3,0,,,"Medtronic PCT Device Tachyarrhythmia Control System Reference Guide Apr. 1992.;;Ventritex Cadence Tiered Therapy Defibrillator System Cadence Model V 100 and Cadence Programmer, Prel.

According to the present state of the art, endoscopic cannulation of the common bile duct and papillotomy and similar procedures are accomplished by advancing the device into an endoscope/duodenoscope so that the distal tip of the device exits the endoscope adjacent the sphincter muscles at the Papilla of Vater. The endoscope mechanisms are then manipulated to orient the distal tip of the device to the desired position for proper cannulation of the duct. Due to inconsistencies in, for example, the sphincterotome, anatomy, and endoscope manipulation, it is difficult to accurately and consistently position the sphincterotome for proper cannulation. The steerable sphincterotome of the present invention allows the physician to control the position of the distal tip of the device independently of the endoscope and adjust for inconsistencies in the device and the anatomy. According to the present invention, the handle to which the cutting wire is attached is freely rotatable relative to the catheter. The handle, secured to the cutting wire but rotatable relative to the shaft of the catheter, provides a mechanism to rotate the wire, transmitting the force to rotate the device tip. With the handle rotating independently of the shaft at the proximal end, the force can be applied directly to the distal tip without twisting the entire shaft.

As a result, the initial stored energy requirements of the prophylactic ICD system (17) are less than about 12,000 joules, and both the battery (28) and the capacitor systems (26, 27) can be significantly smaller than existing ICD system. The smaller battery (28) and capacitor systems (26, 27) produce in an implantable device having a physical size small enough to permit implantation of the device in the pectoral region.

   The present invention relates to methods and devices for performing endoscopic cannulation, papillotomy and sphincterotomy and similar procedures. According to the present state of the art, endoscopic cannulation of the common bile duct and papillotomy and similar procedures are accomplished by advancing the device into an endoscope/duodenoscope so that the distal tip of the device exits the endoscope adjacent the sphincter muscles at the Papilla of Vater. The endoscope mechanisms are then manipulated to orient the distal tip of the device to the desired position for proper cannulation of the duct. Due to inconsistencies in, for example, the sphincterotome, anatomy, and endoscope manipulation, it is difficult to accurately and consistently position the sphincterotome for proper cannulation. The steerable sphincterotome of the present invention allows the physician to control the position of the distal tip of the device independently of the endoscope and adjust for inconsistencies in the device and the anatomy. According to the present invention, the handle to which the cutting wire is attached is freely rotatable relative to the catheter. The handle, secured to the cutting wire but rotatable relative to the shaft of the catheter, provides a mechanism to rotate the wire, transmitting the force to rotate the device tip. With the handle rotating independently of the shaft at the proximal end, the force can be applied directly to the distal tip without twisting the entire shaft. Also a rotation lock to maintain the orientation of the tip and/or a rotation marking, to indicate the amount of rotation may be included.

According to the present state of the art, endoscopic cannulation of the common bile duct and papillotomy and similar procedures are accomplished by advancing the device into an endoscope/duodenoscope so that the distal tip of the device exits the endoscope adjacent the sphincter muscles at the Papilla of Vater. The endoscope mechanisms are then manipulated to orient the distal tip of the device to the desired position for proper cannulation of the duct. Due to inconsistencies in, for example, the sphincterotome, anatomy, and endoscope manipulation, it is difficult to accurately and consistently position the sphincterotome for proper cannulation. The steerable sphincterotome of the present invention allows the physician to control the position of the distal tip of the device independently of the endoscope and adjust for inconsistencies in the device and the anatomy. According to the present invention, the handle to which the cutting wire is attached is freely rotatable relative to the catheter. The handle, secured to the cutting wire but rotatable relative to the shaft of the catheter, provides a mechanism to rotate the wire, transmitting the force to rotate the device tip. With the handle rotating independently of the shaft at the proximal end, the force can be applied directly to the distal tip without twisting the entire shaft. Also a rotation lock to maintain the orientation of the tip and/or a rotation marking, to indicate the amount of rotation may be included.",BOSTON SCIENT LTD,HUTCHINS JOHN E;;ADAMS MARK L,,https://lens.org/158-060-849-021-746,Granted Patent,no,0,0,13,13,0,A61B18/1492;;A61B2017/003;;A61B2017/0046;;A61B2017/22038;;A61B2017/22067;;A61B2018/00535;;A61B2018/00553;;A61B2018/1253;;A61B2018/1407;;A61B2018/144;;A61B2018/1861;;A61B2218/002;;A61M25/0136;;A61M25/0136;;A61B2018/00553;;A61B2017/0046;;A61B2218/002;;A61B2017/22038;;A61B2017/003;;A61B2017/22067;;A61B18/1492;;A61B2018/1407;;A61B2018/144;;A61B2018/00535;;A61B2018/1253;;A61B2018/1861,A61B17/32;;A61B17/00;;A61B18/14;;A61M25/01,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The invention employs electrical voltage-versus-time signals produced by the heart, these observed from two or more locations. By well-known signal-processing techniques, these signals are reduced to pulses of standardized height and duration, each derived from a prominent feature of the waveform for each heart period, such as its leading edge, in the process eliminating the irrelevant information in the waveform, but retaining the feature that is most relevant in the present context, namely, its precise time of occurrence. The invention then uses further standard electronic techniques to determine the amount of delay between the corresponding pulses in two such pulse trains, in the process distinguishing between monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and more benign conditions. It is a further straightforward matter of signal analysis to determine coincidence rate as a fraction of total pulse rate, which in the normal heart approaches unity (100%), while in the fibrillating heart is much lower, thus diagnosing ventricular fibrillation.

According to the present state of the art, endoscopic cannulation of the common bile duct and papillotomy and similar procedures are accomplished by advancing the device into an endoscope/duodenoscope so that the distal tip of the device exits the endoscope adjacent the sphincter muscles at the Papilla of Vater. The endoscope mechanisms are then manipulated to orient the distal tip of the device to the desired position for proper cannulation of the duct. Due to inconsistencies in, for example, the sphincterotome, anatomy, and endoscope manipulation, it is difficult to accurately and consistently position the sphincterotome for proper cannulation. The steerable sphincterotome of the present invention allows the physician to control the position of the distal tip of the device independently of the endoscope and adjust for inconsistencies in the device and the anatomy. According to the present invention, the handle to which the cutting wire is attached is freely rotatable relative to the catheter. The handle, secured to the cutting wire but rotatable relative to the shaft of the catheter, provides a mechanism to rotate the wire, transmitting the force to rotate the device tip. With the handle rotating independently of the shaft at the proximal end, the force can be applied directly to the distal tip without twisting the entire shaft. Also a rotation lock to maintain the orientation of the tip and/or a rotation marking, to indicate the amount of rotation may be included.",SCIMED LIFE SYSTEMS INC,HUTCHINS JOHN E;;ADAMS MARK L,,https://lens.org/124-699-465-254-261,Patent Application,yes,12,2,13,13,0,A61B18/1492;;A61B2017/003;;A61B2017/0046;;A61B2017/22038;;A61B2017/22067;;A61B2018/00535;;A61B2018/00553;;A61B2018/1253;;A61B2018/1407;;A61B2018/144;;A61B2018/1861;;A61B2218/002;;A61M25/0136;;A61M25/0136;;A61B2018/00553;;A61B2017/0046;;A61B2218/002;;A61B2017/22038;;A61B2017/003;;A61B2017/22067;;A61B18/1492;;A61B2018/1407;;A61B2018/144;;A61B2018/00535;;A61B2018/1253;;A61B2018/1861,A61B17/00;;A61B17/32;;A61B18/14;;A61M25/01,,0,0,,,,PATENTED

According to an embodiment, the system includes an endoscope, a vision head including a light source and a vision chip on both a proximal and a distal side of the vision head, and an extension arm for moving the vision head away from and back toward the endoscope. 

   Alternatively, the light source and vision chip may be contained in a distal end of the endoscope. In such an alternative embodiment, the vision head is a parabolic mirror mounted on the extension arm for reflecting images, for example, from behind the distal end of the endoscope to the vision chip in the distal end of the endoscope to permit, for example, a retrograde view of the surgical site entrance.

The invention employs electrical voltage-versus-time signals produced by the heart, these observed from two or more locations. By well-known signal-processing techniques, these signals are reduced to pulses of standardized height and duration, each derived from a prominent feature of the waveform for each heart period, such as its leading edge, in the process eliminating the irrelevant information in the waveform, but retaining the feature that is most relevant in the present context, namely, its precise time of occurrence. The invention then uses further standard electronic techniques to determine the amount of delay between the corresponding pulses in two such pulse trains, in the process distinguishing between monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and more benign conditions. It is a further straightforward matter of signal analysis to determine coincidence rate as a fraction of total pulse rate, which in the normal heart approaches unity (100%), while in the fibrillating heart is much lower, thus diagnosing ventricular fibrillation. The present invention is hence able to trigger a defibrillating-discharge decision, or a cardioversion-discharge in the prior case, much more reliably than has been possible in the prior art.",ANGEION CORP,ADAMS THEODORE P;;KROLL MARK W,,https://lens.org/004-230-573-982-574,Granted Patent,yes,8,139,6,6,0,A61N1/3956;;A61N1/3956;;A61N1/3621;;A61N1/3621;;A61N1/3622;;A61N1/3622,A61N1/362;;A61N1/39,607/5;;128/705,2,2,002-149-735-930-777;;089-864-028-686-110,2432511;;10.1111/j.1540-8159.1986.tb06672.x;;10.1111/j.1540-8159.1987.tb06138.x;;2444943,"Mercando et al., Measurement of Differences in Timing and Sequence Between Two Ventricular Electrodes as a Means of Tachycardia Differentiation , PACE, vol. 9, pp. 1069 1077.;;Camm et al., Tachycardia Recognition by Implantable Elecronic Devices , PACE, vol. 10, pp. 1175 1190.",EXPIRED

The invention employs electrical voltage-versus-time signals produced by the heart, these observed from two or more locations. By well-known signal-processing techniques, these signals are reduced to pulses of standardized height and duration, each derived from a prominent feature of the waveform for each heart period, such as its leading edge, in the process eliminating the irrelevant information in the waveform, but retaining the feature that is most relevant in the present context, namely, its precise time of occurrence. The invention then uses further standard electronic techniques to determine the amount of delay between the corresponding pulses in two such pulse trains, in the process distinguishing between monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and more benign conditions. It is a further straightforward matter of signal analysis to determine coincidence rate as a fraction of total pulse rate, which in the normal heart approaches unity (100%), while in the fibrillating heart is much lower, thus diagnosing ventricular fibrillation. The present invention is hence able to trigger a defibrillating-discharge decision, or a cardioversion-discharge in the prior case, much more reliably than has been possible in the prior art.",ANGEMED INC,ADAMS THEODORE P;;KROLL MARK W,ANGEION CORPORATION (1997-01-08),https://lens.org/035-327-173-247-12X,Patent Application,yes,0,18,6,6,0,A61N1/3956;;A61N1/3956;;A61N1/3621;;A61N1/3621;;A61N1/3622;;A61N1/3622,A61N1/362;;A61N1/39,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Unlike existing ICD systems, the prophylactic ICD (17) is designed to deliver between about 100 to 200 shocks, with each shock having a maximum delivered energy value of only about 25 joules. As a result, the initial stored energy requirements of the prophylactic ICD system (17) are less than about 12,000 joules, and both the battery (28) and the capacitor systems (26, 27) can be significantly smaller than existing ICD system. The smaller battery (28) and capacitor systems (26, 27) produce in an implantable device having a physical size small enough to permit implantation of the device in the pectoral region.

Examples of the discharge-process possibilities are those of two capacitors in parallel, two in series, two in sequence, or a capacitor or capacitors with polarity inverted. Adding capacitors and switches expands the range of possibilities and provides waveforms ""tailoring"" under the guidance of a switching network that can be digitally programmed from an external programming console, much as in the digital programming of a pacemaker system. Digital signals are transmitted to the implanted system using infrared, visible, RF electromagnetic radiation, or ultrasound radiation. The use of multiple capacitors rather than just a single capacitor makes it possible to pack the components more densely, and in the case of some waveforms, to use less total capacitance than in the prior art, both factors contributing to very desirable size reduction for the implantable defibrillator.

According to the present state of the art, endoscopic cannulation of the common bile duct and papillotomy and similar procedures are accomplished by advancing the device into an endoscope/duodenoscope so that the distal tip of the device exits the endoscope adjacent the sphincter muscles at the Papilla of Vater. The endoscope mechanisms are then manipulated to orient the distal tip of the device to the desired position for proper cannulation of the duct. Due to inconsistencies in, for example, the sphincterotome, anatomy, and endoscope manipulation, it is difficult to accurately and consistently position the sphincterotome for proper cannulation. The steerable sphincterotome of the present invention allows the physician to control the position of the distal tip of the device independently of the endoscope and adjust for inconsistencies in the device and the anatomy. According to the present invention, the handle to which the cutting wire is attached is freely rotatable relative to the catheter. The handle, secured to the cutting wire but rotatable relative to the shaft of the catheter, provides a mechanism to rotate the wire, transmitting the force to rotate the device tip. With the handle rotating independently of the shaft at the proximal end, the force can be applied directly to the distal tip without twisting the entire shaft. Also a rotation lock to maintain the orientation of the tip and/or a rotation marking, to indicate the amount of rotation may be included.",SCIMED LIFE SYSTEMS INC,HUTCHINS JOHN E;;ADAMS MARK L,"BOSTON SCIENTIFIC LIMITED, BM (2015-02-02);;BOSTON SCIENTIFIC LIMITED (2004-01-21)",https://lens.org/187-275-742-662-121,Patent Application,yes,0,0,13,13,0,A61B18/1492;;A61B2017/003;;A61B2017/0046;;A61B2017/22038;;A61B2017/22067;;A61B2018/00535;;A61B2018/00553;;A61B2018/1253;;A61B2018/1407;;A61B2018/144;;A61B2018/1861;;A61B2218/002;;A61M25/0136;;A61M25/0136;;A61B2018/00553;;A61B2017/0046;;A61B2218/002;;A61B2017/22038;;A61B2017/003;;A61B2017/22067;;A61B18/1492;;A61B2018/1407;;A61B2018/144;;A61B2018/00535;;A61B2018/1253;;A61B2018/1861,A61B17/32;;A61B17/00;;A61B18/14;;A61M25/01,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The short-term average pumping power to the gain medium is increased, to provide a burst of pumping energy to the laser gain medium. A subsequent short-term reduction in the average pumping power then allows the gain medium to cool to a desired state steady level. The average pumping power is then increased to maintain this steady state level until the next burst is desired. For example, a pulse of current may be applied to a laser diode at a first current level I<SUB>1 </SUB>for a first time interval Deltat<SUB>1</SUB>, where I<SUB>1 </SUB>exceeds a nominal current value I<SUB>nom </SUB>by an amount DeltaI<SUB>1</SUB>.

To balance the thermal load on the diode an integral of DeltaI<SUB>1 </SUB>over the time Deltat<SUB>1 </SUB>is approximately equal in magnitude to an integral of DeltaI<SUB>2 </SUB>over the time Deltat<SUB>2</SUB>. After applying the pulse of current at the first current level I<SUB>1</SUB>, and before or after reducing the current to the second level I<SUB>2</SUB>, the nominal current is applied to the laser diode for a third time interval Deltat<SUB>3</SUB>.",JDS UNIPHASE CORP,ADAMS FRANK J ARBORE MARK A WI,,https://lens.org/024-631-362-620-277,Patent Application,no,0,1,4,4,0,H01S3/094076;;H01S3/0941;;H01S3/1024;;H01S3/1028;;H01S3/109;;H01S5/06216;;H01S5/0622;;H01S3/08072;;H01S3/109;;H01S3/0941;;H01S5/06216;;H01S3/1024;;H01S5/0622;;H01S3/094076;;H01S3/1028;;H01S3/08072,H01S3/0941;;H01S3/109,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
