The modular access medical system may be formed from a distal end of a cannula configured to be placed into contact with tissue such that fluid can be administered within the cannula and retained therein to facilitate a surgical procedure to be conducted via one or more instruments extending through fluid contained within the cannula.",ARTHREX INC,DREYFUSS PETER;;KEMP ZACHARY A;;ADAMSON TIM E;;GALLIZZI MICHAEL;;JENSEN WADE K;;KARNES G JOSHUA;;NOBLE SHANE J,ARTHREX INC (2021-04-13),https://lens.org/120-234-739-780-58X,Patent Application,yes,12,0,3,3,0,A61B1/00105;;A61B1/053;;A61B1/3132;;A61B1/042;;A61B2017/3443;;A61B17/3421;;A61B2218/008;;A61B17/3462;;A61B2017/3466;;A61B2017/347;;A61B90/50;;A61B2217/005;;A61B2090/3966;;A61B1/3132;;A61B1/042;;A61B2217/005;;A61B1/00105;;A61B17/3439;;A61B17/3423,A61B1/00;;A61B1/313;;A61B1/04;;A61B17/34,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The tubular retractors are affixed to screw extensions to rotate and articulate relative to multi-axial screws percutaneously inserted into respective pedicles of vertebral bodies. The procedure is done bilaterally, although it could be performed unilaterally in cases where the anatomy or surgeon preference dictates.
