The error in the force is a difference between reference force and net force acting on a cylinder. The controller determines a proper pump command so that the error in the force further approaches zero in a step 86. A pump is started by the pump command determined by the step 86 in a step 88. After the step 88, this system returns to a step 78, and is repeatedly performed as long as the float function is started in a step 76. A control system 74 controls the pump 62 so that the float function can be automatically provided for the loader, by setting the net force acting on the cylinder 42 to zero, by measuring pressure of respective chambers 44, 46 and 48 of the cylinder 42. <P>COPYRIGHT: (C)2008,JPO&INPIT",DEERE & CO,ANDERSON ERIC R;;HINDMAN JAHMY;;GRAEVE JOSHUA D,,https://lens.org/184-541-959-366-139,Patent Application,no,4,0,8,8,0,E02F9/2217;;E02F9/2217;;E02F9/2203;;E02F9/2203;;E02F9/2289;;E02F9/2289;;E02F9/2296;;E02F9/2296;;F15B1/024;;F15B1/024;;F15B11/08;;F15B11/08;;F15B15/1466;;F15B15/1466;;F15B2211/20546;;F15B2211/20546;;F15B2211/20561;;F15B2211/20561;;F15B2211/6313;;F15B2211/6313;;F15B2211/7053;;F15B2211/7053,E02F9/22;;F15B11/08;;F15B21/14,,0,0,,,,PENDING

For example, the dressing can include a membrane that maintains a sterile enclosed volume over the wound. Pressure in the enclosed volume can be reduced by deforming the membrane and compressing a resilient open-cell sponge provided therein, facilitating a relatively unobstructed flow of air out of the enclosed volume. Oxygen and/or moisture can be introduced by a controlled flow of moist oxygen-containing gas into the enclosed volume. An oxygen-producing reaction within the enclosed volume using calcium peroxide or the like can also provide oxygen to the wound site. An external vacuum source that includes compressible foam can also be coupled to the enclosed volume to provide a reduced pressure therein.

Process plant data from secure communications is then analyzed to detect conditions occurring at process plant entities in a process plant using various machine learning techniques. When the process plant entity is a valve, a mode of operation for the valve is determined and a different analysis is applied for each mode in which the valve operates. Additionally, the process plant data for each valve is compared to other valves in the same process plant, enterprise, industry, etc. Accordingly, health of each of the valves is ranked relative to each other and the process plant data for each valve is displayed in a side-by-side comparison.SELECTED DRAWING: Figure 3",FISHER ROSEMOUNT SYSTEMS INC,NIXON MARK J;;JOSHUA B KIDD;;MICHAEL J BOUDREAUX;;SHAWN W ANDERSON;;ERIC ROTVOLD,,https://lens.org/061-651-146-441-725,Patent Application,no,2,1,10,10,0,G05B19/418;;G05B19/4184;;G05B2219/32191;;Y02P90/02;;G05B15/02;;G05B17/02;;G05B19/4185;;G05B23/0221;;G05B23/024;;Y02P90/02;;G05B19/4184;;G05B2219/32191,G05B23/02,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

An estimated height of grass cut by the robotic mower is determined for a predetermined number of past mowing tasks. The estimated height of grass cut is compared with a predicted height of grass in an operating environment for the robotic mower. Then, a mowing schedule for the robotic mower is adjusted by decreasing a time between mowing tasks in response to the estimated height of grass cut being greater than the predicted height of grass. Alternatively, the mowing schedule for the robotic mower is adjusted by increasing the time between mowing tasks in response to the estimated height of grass cut being less than the predicted height of grass. 19088-US FIG. 3 3/6 300 ,-I' MOWING SYSTEM SERVICE ROBOT MOWER 306 MACHINE CONTROLLER DOWNLOAD HORTICULTURAL USER MODULE KNOWLEDGE BASE INTERFACE 324 330 326 332 328 CLOCK/CALENDAR SOFTWARE SOFTWARE 308-,J PROPULSION STEERING 310 SYSTEM SYSTEM 312 BRAKING SENSOR 314 SYSTEM SYSTEM CUTTING UNIT II MONITORING 316 334 MOTOR SYSTEM 318 320 COMMUNICATIONS UNIT 322 DATA STORAGE DEVICE 336 MOWING SCHEDULE 338 USER PROFILE 340 HEIGHT OF GRASS CUT ESTIMATES CHARGING STATION",DEERE & CO,THACHER RUSSELL J;;EISENBEIS KIRK N;;JOHNSON DAVID A;;ANDERSON NOEL W;;HOFFMAN JOSHUA D,,https://lens.org/182-025-222-980-288,Patent Application,no,0,1,5,5,0,A01B79/005;;A01D34/008;;A01G25/00;;A01D34/008;;A01B79/005,G06F15/16;;G05D1/02,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   A recovery process for embedded processors monitors other processes in the system. Each process may specify a recovery policy residing in nonvolatile electronic memory that preferably includes a recovery count, a recovery time, and a recovery action. If a process terminates unexpectedly, the recovery process determines whether the process had a corresponding recovery policy. If not, the recovery process does not recover the process. If the process has a corresponding recovery policy, the recovery process determines whether it can recover the process by examining the recovery count and recovery time specified in the recovery policy. If the process can be recovered, the recovery process performs the recovery action specified in the corresponding recovery policy. If the process cannot be recovered, the recovery process resets the system. In this manner, a single process may be recovered by the recovery process without user intervention and without affecting other processes running on the system, and without performing a reset of the entire system.
