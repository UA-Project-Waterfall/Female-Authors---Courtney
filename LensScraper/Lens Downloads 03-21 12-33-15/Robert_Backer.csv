The pliers have a hand grip end and a barrel end. A pusher bar reciprocates within the hollow barrel portion causing the Y-shaped clip grip to open or close, depending upon the position of the push rod. A trigger mechanism causes the spring loaded pusher bar to shift toward the Y-shaped grip when the trigger is squeezed. A locking mechanism enables an aneurysm clip to be placed between the arms of the Y-shaped grip and retained therein until the aneurysm clip is to be applied on the blood vessel. The barrel end is rotatable through 360.degree. with respect to the hand grip end of the aneurysm clip pliers, and the Y-shaped grip permits the aneurysm clip to pivot about an arc slightly larger than 180.degree.. Accordingly, positioning the aneurysm clip on the defective blood vessel is easily accomplished.",B & B TOOLS,BACKER ROBERT,B & B TOOLS (1985-09-07),https://lens.org/057-084-298-933-144,Granted Patent,yes,8,290,1,1,0,A61B17/1285;;A61B17/1285;;A61B17/1227;;A61B17/1227;;A61B2017/2937;;A61B2017/2937,A61B17/122;;A61B17/128;;A61B17/28,128/325;;128/346,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

SOLUTION: A solenoid valve 52 is attached to a variable displacement piston pump 10, and this solenoid valve 52 is placed on a passage between a first control input part 40 of a pressure correction valve 26 and a servo piston 24. When the solenoid valve 52 is opened, the fluid pressure in the first control input part 40, that is, the pressured liquid generated in the pump 12 can be supplied to the servo piston 23 which controls an inclination angle of a swash plate 22 through the solenoid valve 52. Whereby the swash plate 22 is movable by the servo piston 23 even when the servo piston 24 is connected to a drain pipe 20 through the pressure and flow rate correction valves 26, 28, and the discharge amount of the pump 12 can be reduced by reducing the moving quantity of the piston in the pump 12.",GROVE US LLC,BACKER ROBERT D;;HALL DAVID A;;JOHNSTON ROBERT W,,https://lens.org/159-025-597-002-217,Patent Application,no,0,1,9,9,0,F04B49/03;;F04B49/06;;F04B49/08;;F04B49/12;;F04B2201/0206;;F04B2201/1202;;F04B2201/1203;;F04B2205/09;;F04B2207/703;;F04B49/06;;F04B49/12;;F04B2201/1202;;F04B2207/703;;F04B2205/09;;F04B2201/0206;;F04B2201/1203;;F04B49/08;;F04B49/03,F04B1/26;;F04B27/14;;F04B49/03;;F04B49/08;;F04B49/12;;F04B49/06;;F15B11/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In one embodiment, the cluster tool is adapted to perform a track lithography process in which a substrate is coated with a photosensitive material, is then transferred to a stepper/scanner, which exposes the photosensitive material to some form of radiation to form a pattern in the photosensitive material, which is then removed in a developing process completed in the cluster tool. In track lithography type cluster tools, since the chamber processing times tend to be rather short, and the number of processing steps required to complete a typical track system process is large, a significant portion of the time it takes to process a substrate is taken up by the processes of transferring the substrates in a cluster tool between the various processing chambers. In one embodiment of the cluster tool, the cost of ownership is reduced by grouping substrates together and transferring and processing the substrates in groups of two or more to improve system throughput, and reduces the number of moves a robot has to make to transfer a batch of substrates between the processing chambers, thus reducing wear on the robot and increasing system reliability. In one aspect of the invention, the substrate processing sequence and cluster tool are designed so that the substrate transferring steps performed during the processing sequence are only made to chambers that will perform the next processing step in the processing sequence. Embodiments also provide for a method and apparatus that are used to improve the coater chamber, the developer chamber, the post exposure bake chamber, the chill chamber, and the bake chamber process results.

In one embodiment, the cluster tool is adapted to perform a track lithography process in which a substrate is coated with a photosensitive material, is then transferred to a stepper/scanner, which exposes the photosensitive material to some form of radiation to form a pattern in the photosensitive material, which is then removed in a developing process completed in the cluster tool. In track lithography type cluster tools, since the chamber processing times tend to be rather short, and the number of processing steps required to complete a typical track system process is large, a significant portion of the time it takes to process a substrate is taken up by the processes of transferring the substrates in a cluster tool between the various processing chambers. In one embodiment of the cluster tool, the cost of ownership is reduced by grouping substrates together and transferring and processing the substrates in groups of two or more to improve system throughput, and reduces the number of moves a robot has to make to transfer a batch of substrates between the processing chambers, thus reducing wear on the robot and increasing system reliability. In one aspect of the invention, the substrate processing sequence and cluster tool are designed so that the substrate transferring steps performed during the processing sequence are only made to chambers that will perform the next processing step in the processing sequence. Embodiments also provide for a method and apparatus that are used to improve the coater chamber, the developer chamber, the post exposure bake chamber, the chill chamber, and the bake chamber process results. Embodiments also provide for a method and apparatus that are used to increase the reliability of the substrate transfer process to reduce system down time.",APPLIED MATERIALS INC,ISHIKAWA TETSUYA;;ROBERTS RICK J;;ARMER HELEN R;;VOLFOVSKI LEON;;PINSON JAY D;;RICE MIKE;;QUACH DAVID H;;SALEK MOHSEN S;;LOWRANCE ROBERT;;BACKER JOHN A;;WEAVER WILLIAM T;;CARLSON CHARLES;;WANG CHONGYANG;;HUDGENS JEFFREY;;HERCHEN HARALD;;LUE BRIAN,SCREEN SEMICONDUCTOR SOLUTIONS CO.

In one embodiment, the cluster tool is adapted to perform a track lithography process in which a substrate is coated with a photosensitive material, is then transferred to a stepper/scanner, which exposes the photosensitive material to some form of radiation to form a pattern in the photosensitive material, which is then removed in a developing process completed in the cluster tool. In track lithography type cluster tools, since the chamber processing times tend to be rather short, and the number of processing steps required to complete a typical track system process is large, a significant portion of the time it takes to process a substrate is taken up by the processes of transferring the substrates in a cluster tool between the various processing chambers. In one embodiment of the cluster tool, the cost of ownership, is reduced by grouping substrates together and transferring and processing the substrates in groups of two or more to improve system throughput, and reduces the number of moves a robot has to make to transfer a batch of substrates between the processing chambers, thus reducing wear on the robot and increasing system reliability. In one aspect of the invention, the substrate processing sequence and cluster tool are designed so that the substrate transferring steps performed during the processing sequence are only made to chambers that will perform the next processing step in the processing sequence. Embodiments also provide for a method and apparatus that are used to improve the coater chamber, the developer chamber, the post exposure bake chamber, the chill chamber, and the bake chamber process results.

In one embodiment, the cluster tool is adapted to perform a track lithography process in which a substrate is coated with a photosensitive material, is then transferred to a stepper/scanner, which exposes the photosensitive material to some form of radiation to form a pattern in the photosensitive material, which is then removed in a developing process completed in the cluster tool. In track lithography type cluster tools, since the chamber processing times tend to be rather short, and the number of processing steps required to complete a typical track system process is large, a significant portion of the time it takes to process a substrate is taken up by the processes of transferring the substrates in a cluster tool between the various processing chambers. In one embodiment of the cluster tool, the cost of ownership is reduced by grouping substrates together and transferring and processing the substrates in groups of two or more to improve system throughput, and reduces the number of moves a robot has to make to transfer a batch of substrates between the processing chambers, thus reducing wear on the robot and increasing system reliability.
