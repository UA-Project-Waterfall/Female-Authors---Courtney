Carey, R. F., and Todd, A. A. Nov. 20. [Cognate Application, 5011/13.] Revolving-cylinder pumps; multiple-acting piston pumps.-Fluid-pressure motors, pumps, &c. are provided with balls, rollers, or the like acting by themselves as pistons and capable of free rotation. Fig. 1 shows a revolving-cylinder pump or motor in which balls 4 are fitted within cylinders 1 and are reciprocated by an eccentric cam track 3. The axes of the cylinders are arranged tangential to a small circle, as shown, so that in one direction the resultant pressure is taken approximately along the axis of each cylinder. The valve 2 is arranged centrally as described in Specification 19,519/11. The cam track 3 may be adjustable to permit of a variable stroke being imparted to the pistons. Fig. 4 shows a form of apparatus in which two cam-tracks 3 and two rings of cylinders 1 are employed. In the form shown in Fig. 5, the axes of the cylinders are parallel to the axis of rotation. Each cylinder contains two balls 4, the inlet from the valve 2 being between the balls. Cam tracks 3 which may be designed to give one or more strokes per revolution, reciprocate the balls. Fig. 7 shows a modified form of this apparatus in which guides 7 conveniently formed by extensions of the cylinders, are provided in cases where a stroke greater than half the diameter of the ball is required. Two or more balls are used and the cam tracks 3 project within space between the guide-pieces. Fig. 8 shows a form in which rollers 4 are used instead of balls. Pintles 8 carrying the rollers run on tracks 10 and ride up and down slots 9 in the cylinder walls. In the form shown in Fig. 10, loose rings 10 are used for supporting the pintles in place of the fixed tracks 10, shown in Fig. 8. For holding the balls against the cam-tracks, springs may be provided or the suction fluid may be supplied under a head of pressure. In another arrangement, the space around the drum is filled with liquid which communicates with a tank so that the liquid can only flow from the casing to the tank. Should a vacuum be formed in the cylinders, fluid cannot then be forced back by atmospheric pressure.",CAREY ROBERT FALKLAND;;TODD ANDREW ALEXANDER,CAREY ROBERT FALKLAND;;TODD ANDREW ALEXANDER,,https://lens.org/143-784-537-410-59X,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,F04B1/22;;F01B1/0655;;F01B1/0658;;F01B3/04;;F03C1/0406;;F03C1/046;;F03C1/047;;F03C1/0605;;F03C1/0639;;F04B1/0408;;F04B1/047;;F04B1/07;;F04B1/1071;;F04B1/124;;F04B1/205,F01B1/06;;F01B3/04;;F04B1/20;;F04B1/22,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Y., and Todd, A. L. Feb. 7, 1910. Moving-chamber apparatus with several chambers; varying quantity measured.-A tap for measuring and registering the delivery of liquids such as spirits, is inserted in a cask &c. and the liquid is delivered by pulling out a rod A. When the rod is given a partial rotation to the right or left before withdrawal, different quantities of liquid are obtained respectively. A hollow piston B, divided by disks b, b<1> into measuring-compartments C, D, F, slides within a cylinder A<1> inserted in the cask &c. The disks b, b<1> have ports b<2>, b<3>, with which ports b<6>, b<7>, b<8> in face valves b<4>, b<5> on the rod A may register. In one position, the valves close the ports in both disks b, b<1>, so that when the piston is pulled forwards until the opening c registers with the outlet only the liquid in the compartment C escapes. When the rod A is turned to the right, the ports b<2>, b<6> coincide, so that on the withdrawal of the piston the liquid from the compartments C, D escapes. When the rod A is turned to the left, the ports b<2>, b<7> coincide and also the ports b<3>, b<8>, so that the liquid contained in all the measuring-compartments is delivered. The compartments are filled, when the rod A is pushed in, through slots a<5>, a<6>, a<7>. Air-vent passages d<2>, d<3> are also provided. To ensure that the rod shall be turned to the correct extent for each operation, and to return it after each withdrawal to its normal position, the rod is provided with a cam E having slots as shown in Fig. 12. The rod can only be drawn out when a fixed pin f engages in one or other of the slots e, e<1>, e<2>, and the diagonal slots e', e<5> connecting them are of greater depth than the slots e, e', so that, when the rod A is in its extreme outward position, the pin f falls into one of the grooves e<4>, e<5>. On the return of the rod the pin f moves along one of the grooves c<4>, e<5> and restores the piston to its normal central position. Veeder or other totalizers are actuated by rods f<2>, f<3>, f<4>, Fig. 14, which are engaged by a T-piece f<1> on the cam E. Fig. 15 shows a modification for delivering two different measures. The face valve g<1> is kept against the partition g by a spring encircling the rod J, which is in two parts fitting one within the other. To ensure that the rod and the valve g<1> shall be in the correct position before withdrawal, the rod is provided with a key m which may slide through one of two slots in the cylinder casing. A pin n on the rod m actuates one of the arms n<2> of the totalizer. An air vent r<1> is provided. The piston may be prevented from rotating when the valves are rotated by means of a pin which slides in a longitudinal slot in the casing A<1>.",QUEATE JOHN YOUNG;;TODD ALEXANDER LECKIE,QUEATE JOHN YOUNG;;TODD ALEXANDER LECKIE,,https://lens.org/044-707-834-148-446,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,G01F11/021,G01F11/02,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The modification is such that the filaments (or parts thereof or fibres cut therefrom into staple length and perhaps crimped) undergo a corresponding variable change of length by shrinkage or extension when subjected to a uniform length-changing treatment e.g. wet or dry heating or chemical treatment of relaxed or tensioned-filaments at the fibre or (single or plied) yarn stage. The difference in modification extends longitudinally of each filament and/or between different filaments. Individual stapled fibres may have a shrinkage characteristic which varies from a maximum at one end to a minimum at the other end. Staple derived from separately prepared tows, p the filaments of which may differ as regards chemical nature, form and/or denier, may be blended and spun into yarn. A bulky fabric comprises polyacrylinitrile fibres bonded with rubber latex and then subjected to a steam treatment to induce differential shrinkage within and/or between the fibres. In apparatus for subjecting viscose filaments to a variable liquid treatment, Fig. 3 (not shown) the tow passes through a bath 19 containing a water-soluble ethylene urea formaldehyde precondensate and a resinifying catalyst such as magnesium or ammonium chloride, thence through driven nip rollers 20 the squeeze pressure between which is varied (by mechanism comprising rotating arm 23, lever 22 and loading spring 21) so as to effect a variable expression of the bath liquid: alternatively or additionally, the resin concentration of the liquid may be varied. The tow then passes through a curing oven 24, water and finish solution baths 25 and 26 and a drier 27. Staple fibre yarn produced from the resultant filaments is immersed in a shrinking agent e.g. aqueous caustic soda solution, and the yarn thus bulked may be stabilized by cross-linkage or the application of a crease-resistant resin. In the stapling apparatus of Fig. 4 (not shown) polyacrylic tow is fed between rollers 35, 36, and 37, 38. Roller 37 is of rubber and roller 38 is surfaced with rubber, carries cutters 39 and rotates eccentrically so that each cut fibre is relaxed in a continuous variable manner from 0-20% from end to end. Steam and cooling air are directed on to the tow by jets 40 and 41. Yarn spun from this staple and heat-treated develops a structure varying from open on the outer surface to compact at the core. In another apparatus, Fig. 5 (not shown) the tow is stapled by a traversing cutter 42 trailing a steam nozzle 43:yarn spun from the staple and heat-treated shows a sharply defined transition from a compact core to a loose surface.",LINEN IND RES ASS,RUDDELL JAMES NELSON;;TODD HERBERT ALEXANDER CONWAY,,https://lens.org/067-496-973-710-846,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,11,0,D02G1/18;;D01G99/00;;D02J1/22,D01G99/00;;D02G1/18,B5B B31Y          26;;B5B B312          26;;B5B B660          26;;B5B B76Y          26;;B5B B801          26;;D1F FX            -;;D1F F21           -;;D1F F51           FZ.F;;D1R RDB           RDB;;D1R R105          RDB;;D1R R3A2G1        R3D2;;D1R R3B1          R3D2;;D1R R3C2A         R3D2;;D1R R3C2F         R3D2;;D1R R3C2Y         R3D2;;D1R R3C5A         R3D2;;D1R R3C5B         R3D2;;D1R R3D1AY        R3D2;;D1R R3D1A2A1      R3D2;;D1R R3D1A3A       R3D2;;D1R R3D3E         R3D2;;D1R R3D3J         R3D2;;D1R R3D3X         R3D2;;D1R R306          RDB;;D1R R307          RDB;;D1R R350          RDB;;D1R R351          RDB;;D1R R352          RDB;;D1R R503          RDB;;D1R R507          RDB;;D1R R508          RDB;;D1R R546          RDB;;D1R R551          RDB;;D1R R556          RDB;;D1R R651          RDB;;D1W W1            -;;D1W W3            -;;D1W W5            -;;D1W W7A           -;;D1W W7B           -;;D1W W7C           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Different parts of the assembly may be subjected to discrete temperatures-for example, room temperature and a temperature producing maximum shrinkage-or to temperatures varying within a given range. In one embodiment a sliver is passed on a lattice through an air curtain comprised of air of two temperatures mixed by a rotary valve which is rotated by a motor to vary the mixture. In a second embodiment a sliver is laid in a zigzag manner on a perforated conveyor which passes through a hot air box which is divided laterally of the conveyor into a plurality of compartments each having a fan and an electric heater-the heaters having different ratings. In a third embodiment the sliver is drawn through a fluidised bed having a variable temperature. The assembly may be heated in the presence of moisture.

[Also in Division B5] In the production of bulked yarn, drawn, wholly synthetic e.g. polyacrylic, thermoplastic, continuous filaments are simultaneously and variably stretched (as they are produced from a spinneret or subsequently) by passage of a sheet of the filaments through a drawing apparatus comprising two pairs of similarly dimensioned and driven, but oppositely disposed, conical rollers linked by mechanism which repeatedly causes the rollers to separate in turn so that the pairs alternately grip and effect stretching of the filaments. All or most of the filaments are thus stretched by varying amounts along their length (dependent on the speed of the rollers and the frequency of transfer of effective operation from one pair to the other) and also across the sheet. The filaments are twisted into a yarn which is subjected to a uniform heat shrinkage treatment to bulk the yarn as a result of differential shrinkage effects within and between the filaments. The effect may be further varied by changing the twist.",LINEN IND RES ASS,RUDDELL JAMES NELSON;;TODD HERBERT ALEXANDER CONWAY,,https://lens.org/161-617-304-780-690,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,D02G1/18,D02G1/18,B5B B350          13;;B5B B436          13;;B5B B609          13;;B5B B714          13;;B5B B72Y          13;;B5B B725          13;;D1F FX            -;;D1F F51           FZ.F;;D1W W1            -;;D1W W3            -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    Described herein is the self-assembly of amphiphilic peptides, i.e., peptides with alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues, into macroscopic membranes. The membrane-forming peptides are greater than 12 amino acids in length, and preferably at least 16 amino acids, are complementary and are structurally compatible. Specifically, two peptides, (AEAEAKAK) _{ 2 } (ARARADAD) _{ 2 } , were shown to self-assemble into macroscopic membranes. Conditions under which the peptides self-assemble into macroscopic membranes and methods for producing the membranes are also described. The macroscopic membranes have several interesting properties: they are stable in aqueous solution, serum, and ethanol, are highly resistant to heat, alkaline and acidic pH, chemical denaturants, and proteolytic digestion, and are non-cytotoxic. The membranes are potentially useful in biomaterial applications such as slow-diffusion drug delivery systems, artificial skin, and separation matrices, and as experimental models for Alzheimer's disease and scrapie infection. The sequence of the peptide, EAK16, was derived from a putative Z-DNA binding protein from yeast, called zuotin. The cloning and characterization of the ZUO1 gene are also described.

The degradable wrap is fitted around the foam element and temporarily maintains the foam element in a compressed state against an outer surface of a downhole sand control device. It is provided to keep the foam element in the compressed state while a production assembly comprising the downhole sand control device and foam element mounted thereon is placed downhole in a well bore adjacent to a production zone. The degradable wrap is permeable to the production fluid and degrades over time. Once the degradable wrap has degraded the foam element fills the annulus between the production screen and casing string or well bore wall.

Yarn 3 from a hank 1 on a reel 2 is furnished to a pirn 8 rotated by bevel gearing 13, the yarn being traversed by guide arm 7 oscillated by a cam 9 through linkage 10. The cam 16, rotated in synchronism with the cam 9, moves the thread guide 5 up and down between normally fixed guides 4, 6, over which the yarn passes, the guide 5 being attached to a pivoted lever 14. The guide 5 has a sloping front face 21 so that in threading- up the yarn will find its way into the guide slot or when an arm 17 carrying the guides 4, 6, is swung downwardly about the rocker 18 against spring-action 19, a thumb-piece 22 being provided for this purpose. A slot 23 and pin 20 limit the movement of the arm 17. The traverse guide 25 is pivoted at 26 to the guide arm 7, so that it always contacts the coned end of the pirn, the guide 25 being slotted at 27 and arranged to be self-threading.",LINEN IND RES ASS,BODEL CHARLES CLARKE;;RANKIN ALAN GEORGE;;TODD HERBERT ALEXANDER CONWAY,,https://lens.org/012-042-779-661-372,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B65H59/005;;B65H2701/31,B65H59/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    Described herein is the self-assembly of amphiphilic peptides, i.e., peptides with alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues, into macroscopic membranes. The membrane-forming peptides are greater than 12 amino acids in length, and preferably at least 16 amino acids, are complementary and are structurally compatible. Specifically, two peptides, (AEAEAKAK) ₂ (ARARADAD) ₂ , were shown to self-assemble into macroscopic membranes. Conditions under which the peptides self-assemble into macroscopic membranes and methods for producing the membranes are also described. The macroscopic membranes have several interesting properties: they are stable in aqueous solution, serum, and ethanol, are highly resistant to heat, alkaline and acidic pH, chemical denaturants, and proteolytic digestion, and are non-cytotoxic. The membranes are potentially useful in biomaterial applications such as slow-diffusion drug delivery systems, artificial skin, and separation matrices, and as experimental models for Alzheimer's disease and scrapie infection. The sequence of the peptide, EAK16, was derived from a putative Z-DNA binding protein from yeast, called zuotin. The cloning and characterization of the ZUO1 gene are also described.

The puck is confined to move on a puck surface having a puck field of motion defined thereon. The puck field of motion is divided into a pointing region and a function region. A controller determines a position for the puck within the field of motion. The display screen displays a two-dimensional scene and a cursor that moves within the scene in a manner controlled by the position of the puck when the puck is in the pointing region. The controller causes the scene to change when the puck is in the function region. A deformable barrier that inhibits the movement of the puck into the function region can be used to prevent inadvertent changing of the display scene. The inhibition is overcome by a user applying additional force to the puck in a direction parallel to the surface.,AVAGO TECH ECBU IP SG PTE LTD,SACHS TODD STEPHEN;;HARLEY JONAH ALEXANDER;;HOLLENHORST JAMES N;;MATTA FARID,AVAGO TECHNOLOGIES GENERAL IP (SINGAPORE) PTE.

Time-dependent signals are accepted from a user input device. The input is processed in real-time such that the user's input can be used to directly control the animation of an animated character. For example, the animation of a three-dimensional rendered character swinging a golf club in a golf game can be changed in mid-swing according to the user's operation of an input device. In general the system accepts user continuous and real-time user input. The user is given improved control and visual feedback on the movement being animated. One embodiment of the invention includes an analog input module, a control state machine module and an animation state machine module. The analog input module is configured to receive user analog input (e.g., from an analog joystick) related to animated character display and to normalize the user analog input to create a normalized user analog input.",ELECTRONIC ART INC,BOSWELL COLIN;;KARWEIT WILLIAM ALEXANDER;;OLSEN MIKE RYAN;;GROWNEY TODD WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/191-756-646-980-949,Granted Patent,yes,2,2,5,5,0,A63F2300/6045;;A63F2300/6607;;A63F2300/8011;;G06F3/011;;G06F3/038;;G06F3/04815;;G06T13/40;;A63F13/42;;A63F2300/66;;A63F13/52;;A63F13/56;;A63F13/812;;A63F13/52;;A63F13/42;;A63F13/812;;A63F2300/8011;;G06F3/04815;;A63F2300/6607;;G06F3/011;;A63F2300/6045;;G06F3/038;;G06T13/40,G09G5/08;;G06F3/00;;G06F3/01;;G06F3/038;;G06T15/70;;G09G5/00,345/161;;345/156;;345/162,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    Described herein is the self-assembly of amphiphilic peptides, i.e., peptides with alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues, into macroscopic membranes. The membrane-forming peptides are greater than 12 amino acids in length, and preferably at least 16 amino acids, are complementary and are structurally compatible. Specifically, two peptides, (AEAEAKAK) _{ 2 } (ARARADAD) _{ 2 } , were shown to self-assemble into macroscopic membranes. Conditions under which the peptides self-assemble into macroscopic membranes and methods for producing the membranes are also described. The macroscopic membranes have several interesting properties: they are stable in aqueous solution, serum, and ethanol, are highly resistant to heat, alkaline and acidic pH, chemical denaturants, and proteolytic digestion, and are non-cytotoxic. The membranes are potentially useful in biomaterial applications such as slow-diffusion drug delivery systems, artificial skin, and separation matrices, and as experimental models for Alzheimer's disease and scrapie infection. The sequence of the peptide, EAK16, was derived from a putative Z-DNA binding protein from yeast, called zuotin. The cloning and characterization of the ZUO1 gene are also described.

   The invention facilitates provision of a point-to-point cable connection between first and second points separated by an extended span of water including a first region of shallow water and a second region of relatively deep water. A plurality of ducts are provided from the first point through the first region of the extended span to an offshore termination point between the first and second points. Preferably, the ducts are buried in the seabed to prevent damage. At least one first cable is placed in one of the plurality of ducts to provide a connection between the first point and the offshore termination point. A second cable from the second point is received at the offshore termination point. The first cable is connected to the second cable at the offshore termination point to create the point-to-point cable connection. In one embodiment, the offshore termination point is located on the continental shelf near the transition to deep water. Cable can be installed between the first point and the offshore termination point with relative ease by passing the cable through an available conduit. This eliminates the need for the time consuming and expensive permitting process typically associated with near-shore cable installation.

    A drive for a carrier tape used in conjunction with a pick and place module of a machine for inspecting and handling advances the carrier tape to its desired position in two steps. Using the number of sprocket holes between compartments in the tape (n holes), the first step is n1 sprocket holes. The second step takes the carrier tape the remaining distance to complete the advance to the distance equal to n sprocket holes. The tape is driven by friction rollers not by the use of the sprocket holes. The presence of a device in a compartment and its proper positioning in the compartment is also inspected.

   A drive for a carrier tape used in conjunction with a pick and place module of a machine for inspecting and handling advances the carrier tape to its desired position in two steps. Using the number of sprocket holes between compartments in the tape (n holes), the first step is n1 sprocket holes. The second step takes the carrier tape the remaining distance to complete the advance to the distance equal to n sprocket holes. The tape is driven by friction rollers not by means of the sprocket holes. The presence of a device in a compartment and its proper positioning in the compartment is also inspected.

The method comprises measuring the voltage difference between the electrodes of the DEA, the first derivative of that voltage with respect to time, and the total instantaneous current through the DEA, then calculating the capacitance of the DEA as the difference between the total instantaneous current through the DEA and the product of the voltage between the electrodes and an error term, divided by the first derivative of the voltage between the electrodes with respect to time. The capacitance may then be used to derive estimates of the leakage current, charge upon the DEA, and/or the physical state of the DEA, thereby implementing self-sensing to allow closed-loop feedback control of DEA actuation.",AUCKLAND UNISERVICES LTD;;GISBY TODD ALAN;;CALIUS EMILIO PATRICIO;;O BRIEN BENJAMIN MARC;;XIE SHANE;;ANDERSON IAIN ALEXANDER,GISBY TODD ALAN;;CALIUS EMILIO PATRICIO;;O BRIEN BENJAMIN MARC;;XIE SHANE;;ANDERSON IAIN ALEXANDER,,https://lens.org/170-122-935-170-612,Patent Application,yes,1,12,8,8,0,H02N2/062;;H10N30/802;;H02N2/062;;H10N30/802,H01L41/00;;B25J19/00;;B81B3/00,,4,3,012-122-904-753-461;;173-730-910-746-687;;010-654-108-257-971,10.1117/12.797944;;10.1117/12.715823;;10.1016/j.sna.2007.10.076,"T.A.

The inlet air treatment is achieved in a columnar tower (22) with the inlet air being drawn in at the top of the tower (70). Treatment water (80), for example at 0-4.5 degree C, is injected with the air at a downward velocity exceeding that of the inlet air to establish a vertically descending, two-phase co-current flow of inlet air and treatment water. The above flow pattern increases the density of the turbine inlet air by producing a drag-induced pressure boost to the inlet air and also by cooling the inlet air by direct heat transfert from the cold water. The invention serves to increase the operational capacity and efficiency of existing or new peaking combustion turbines at a cost per kW that is substantially less than that of installing new peaking combustion turbine capacity, while also permitting enhanced load following capabilities for the electric utility's control center.",CAROLINA POWER & LIGHT CO,DAVIS THOMAS L;;SHELL JOHN P;;BEADLE TODD W;;MCALLISTER KEITH S;;HOBBS ALEXANDER O,,https://lens.org/048-169-645-306-599,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,PENDING
