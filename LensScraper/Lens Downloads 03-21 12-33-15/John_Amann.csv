An expected thermal energy flow is calculated based on designed engine speed and ignition timing. A residual energy flow is calculated based on a difference between the estimated actual thermal energy flow and the expected thermal energy flow. Meanwhile, a system quality-weighting factor is calculated based on several measured engine parameters. A qualified energy flow residual is calculated based on the system quality weight and the residual energy flow. The qualified energy residual flow is accumulated, averaged based on the accumulated quality weight, and then filtered. Diagnostic control determines that if the cold start emissions reduction control is operating correctly based on the filtered averaged qualified energy flow residual comparing a predetermined range.",GEN MOTORS CORP,WANG WENBO;;JESS RICHARD B;;HAMILTON LYLE E;;BOLSTRUM DANIEL G;;ROELLE MATTHEW J;;VAN GILDER JOHN F;;BELTON DAVID N;;AMANN RICHARD W;;FU FANG-CHENG J,GM GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS LLC (2005-01-19);;GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION (2004-01-23),https://lens.org/114-066-327-221-987,Granted Patent,yes,1,18,1,1,0,F02D41/0255;;F02D41/0255;;F02D41/0245;;F02D41/0245;;F02D41/064;;F02D41/064;;F02D41/1441;;F02D41/1441;;F02D41/187;;F02D41/187;;F02D2200/0404;;F02D2200/0404;;F02D2200/0406;;F02D2200/0406;;Y02T10/12;;Y02T10/12,F02D41/02;;F02D41/06;;F02D41/14,701/114,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
