    A method whereby a computing platform that uses geographic data that are spatially organized into parcels of a given size can specify a parcel block size larger than the given size. Thereafter, during runtime, the geographic data are accessed by the computing platform in groups of one or more parcels not larger than the parcel block size. According to one embodiment, at or after initialization of the computing platform, groupings of parcels corresponding to parcel blocks are determined. Each parcel block has a size larger than the maximum parcel size but not larger than a maximum parcel block size. Data identifying the groupings and the parcels corresponding thereto are stored on the computing platform and the data identifying the groupings and the parcels corresponding thereto are used to access all the parcels corresponding to a parcel block whenever geographic data in any one of the parcels are needed.

The plurality of data entities are separated into a plurality of parcels each of which contains a grouping of data entities that represent features in the geographic area encompassed within a separate one of a plurality of rectangles which together encompass all the features in the entire geographic region represented by all of the plurality of data entities. Each of the plurality of data entities has a data entity ID.

Associated with the geographic database is a searchable kd-tree structure whose nodes represent divisions of the geographic region into the rectangles from which the parcels are formed. The kd-tree structure permits spatial searching for a parcel based upon geographic coordinates. The kd-tree also includes data at certain of its nodes that identify the ranges of data entity ID's included in parcels formed from rectangles resulting from the divisions thereby enabling the kd-tree to be used as a binary tree for performing searches using the data entity ID's.

For geographic features that are other-than-straight, a curve generated by a computable function is fitted to an image of the other-than-straight map feature. The computable function may be a polynomial equation whose shape is defined by its coefficients. In one embodiment, the polynomial equation is a type of spline curve, in particular a Bezier curve whose shape is defined by control points. The coefficients of the polynomial equation are associated with data representing the other-than-straight feature. In the case in which the polynomial equation is a Bezier curve, the control points for generating the Bezier curve are associated with the data representing the other-than-straight feature. These control points are stored in the geographic database and are used in displaying the other-than-straight geographic feature. Use of a computable function to generate other-than-straight geographic features and storing parameters to be used by the computable function has the potential for significantly reducing the storage requirements for representing other-than-straight features in a geographic database. According to a further aspect, normalized control point pairs are stored in a data structure and an index reference into the data structure is associated with data used to represent the other-than-straight geographic features, thereby resulting in further reduction in data storage requirements.",NAVIGATION TECH CORP,MEEK JAMES;;ASHBY RICHARD;;LAMPERT DAVID,"NAVTEQ NORTH AMERICA, LLC (2005-03-02);;NAVIGATION TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION (2001-09-26);;HERE GLOBAL B.V., NL (2015-12-11)",https://lens.org/176-872-972-433-187,Patent Application,yes,4,15,8,8,0,G01C21/3867;;G01C21/3852;;G01C21/3819;;Y10S707/99943;;Y10S707/99945;;Y10S707/92;;Y10S707/99948;;G01C21/3819;;G01C21/3852;;G01C21/3867,G09B29/00;;G01C21/00;;G01C21/32;;G06T11/60,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In addition, the navigation system includes a preview function that provides a summary of the solution route prior to providing the detailed maneuvering guidance for following the solution route. The preview function is included in the programming of the navigation system. The preview function uses a feature incorporated in the geographic database wherein the portion of the geographic database used by the navigation system when determining a solution route includes references to another portion of the database that includes the actual text of the names of the roads represented thereby. As the navigation system uses the data in the geographic database to determine the solution route, data representing the roads in the solution route are saved, including the references to the other portion of the geographic database that includes the actual text of the names of the roads. After the solution route is determined, the preview function evaluates the data representing the roads in the solution route and provides a list of route preview data structures. The list of route preview data structures includes the references to the portion of the geographic database that includes the actual text of the names of the roads. The list of route preview data structures is used to provide the user of the navigation system with a preview that contains a summary of the solution route. The preview provided to the user can include the names of the roads in the solution route. The names can be obtained from the geographic database using the references contained in the list of route preview data structures. When obtaining the names, the references can be reordered to facilitate accessing the text of the names quickly. By providing a preview of the calculated route, the user is familiarized with the route prior to being given detailed guidance for following the route.",NAVTEQ NORTH AMERICA LLC,FRIEDERICH MATTHEW;;MCDONOUGH WILLIAM;;ASHBY RICHARD,"NAVTEQ NORTH AMERICA, LLC (2005-03-02);;NAVIGATION TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION (2001-09-26);;GARMIN SWITZERLAND GMBH, CH (2013-01-10)",https://lens.org/106-117-569-185-808,Granted Patent,yes,5,0,9,9,0,G01C21/3407;;G06Q10/047;;G09B29/007;;G01C21/3878;;G01C21/3881;;G01C21/3407;;G09B29/007;;G06Q10/047;;Y10S707/99945;;Y10S707/99931;;G01C21/3878;;G01C21/3881,G01C21/34;;G09B29/10;;G01C21/00;;G06Q10/04;;G06Q90/00;;G08G1/0969;;G09B29/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A filter comprises a tubular filtering element 15, housed in an open ended pot or container 14, which is clamped against a head member 13 by an axial screw 35 which screw into the structure 10, e.g. an internal combustion engine, on which the filter is mounted. The head member 13 is adapted to form a closure for a cavity 11 of the structure and is provided with an aperture 16 allowing communication between one side of the filter element and the cavity. The head member is provided with an axial passage 24 and a non-return valve 26 to allow by passing of the liquid then the filter becomes clogged. The head member 13 may also be provided with a liquid inlet passage 17 or this inlet may be provided in the wall of the container 14, thus the connection to the liquid supply is independent of the fixing of the head 16 in the cavity. The filter element is urged against discs 29 and 31 at either end by a spring 34. In a modified form the axial screw 35 is formed in two parts one part being screwed into the structure 10 and having an hexagonal head in the region of the boss 33 of the head member which is held against rotation by the disc 29 while a second screw extending from the bottom of the container screws into this hexagonal head.",AUTOMOTIVE PROD CO LTD,ASHBY RICHARD ALFRED HAROLD;;SEATON GEORGE BENJAMIN,,https://lens.org/054-835-701-040-975,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,B01D35/147;;B01D35/30,B01D35/147;;B01D35/30,B1D DNA           B1DNA;;B1D DNFB          DNFB,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

U.S. PLYWOOD-CHAMPION PAPERS Inc. 10 July, 1969, No. 34833/69. Heading B5N. [Also in Division F2] A laminate is made by coating a face of a fibrous panel, such as plywood, or a sheet of plastics film, paper or metal with adhesive, applying the sheet to the said face of the panel such that a portion of the sheet overextends the face on at least one side, applying adhesive to the or each side which the sheet overextends and/or to the undersurface of the overextending sheet portion and laminating the sheet to said side and if the sheet is long enough, to the underface portions of the panel. The first adhesive may be epoxy resin, the second may be rubberbased and the plastics film may be polyvinyl fluoride or polyester. The panel may be edgetrimmed, cleaned and seal coated prior to the above process. The laminate may be embossed and grooved and may be provided with a central longitudinal V-shaped groove so as to be separable into two panels.

SOLUTION: A curved line generated by a computable function is matched with an image of any map characteristic except for a straight line. The computable function can be a polynomial having a shape limited by the coefficients. In an embodiment, the polynomial is a spline curve of a certain type, specifically, a Bezier curve with its shape limited by control points CP (m) (1) and CP (m) (2). The coefficients of the polynomial are related to the data representing the characteristics except for a straight line. When the polynomial is a Bezier curve, the control points CP (m) (1) and CP (m) (2) for generating the Bizier curve are related to the data representing the characteristic except for a straight line.

    A system and method for storing data to represent other-than-straight map features in a computer-readable geographic database for use in a navigation system. For geographic features that are other-than-straight, a curve generated by a computable function is fitted to an image of the other-than-straight map feature. The computable function may be a polynomial equation whose shape is defined by its coefficients. In one embodiment, the polynomial equation is a type of spline curve, in particular a Bezier curve whose shape is defined by control points. The coefficients of the polynomial equation are associated with data representing the other-than-straight feature. In the case in which the polynomial equation is a Bezier curve, the control points for generating the Bezier curve are associated with the data representing the other-than-straight feature. These control points are stored in the geographic database and are used in displaying the other-than-straight geographic feature. Use of a computable function to generate other-than-straight geographic features and storing parameters to be used by the computable function has the potential for significantly reducing the storage requirements for representing other-than-straight features in a geographic database. According to a further aspect, normalized control point pairs are stored in a data structure and an index reference into the data structure is associated with data used to represent the other-than-straight geographic features, thereby resulting in further reduction in data storage requirements.

The geographic data are stored in a manner that facilitates and enhances use and access of the data by various navigation application functions in navigation systems that use the data. The geographic data includes a parcelization that separates the geographic data into parcels having less than or equal to a maximum parcel size but having at least a desired fill percentage. The parcelization method also provides for a division arrangement that facilitates addressing and identification of the parcels. According to a further aspect, the geographic data includes special nodal entities that are used to collapse complex intersections, such as roundabouts, cloverleaves, and divided highways, into simpler data representations. The special nodal entities are associated with road segment data entities and used in a route calculation program in place of regular node entities. Further, the geographic data include a normalized attribute array that includes reoccurring combinations of certain selected attributes of the geographic data. Indices to the array are included in place of data corresponding to the selected attributes. When a navigation application program requests data, an entry in the normalized attribute table pointed to by an index in the data is used to return the requested data in the particular combination of attributes from the normalized attribute array. The geographic data is compiled by a method that facilitates access to the data on a physical medium. According to the compilation method, data files to be stored on the medium are organized into parcels. The data records within the data files are identified by the parcel in which they are located. An arrangement of all the data files on the medium is determined and a parcel identification related to the medium is assigned to each parcel. Cross references between data records are updated to include the assigned parcel identifications and the parcels are stored on the medium.",ISRANI VIJAYA S.;;ASHBY RICHARD A.;;NYCZAK GREGORY M.;;SMITH NICHOLAS E.,ISRANI VIJAYA S;;ASHBY RICHARD A;;NYCZAK GREGORY M;;SMITH NICHOLAS E,HERE GLOBAL B.V (2014-09-16);;HERE NORTH AMERICA LLC (2013-04-18);;NAVTEQ CORPORATION (2004-02-03),https://lens.org/013-013-317-921-401,Granted Patent,yes,28,280,19,33,0,G08G1/096827;;G08G1/0969;;G09B29/106;;G06F16/29;;G01C21/3867;;G08G1/096827;;G08G1/0969;;G09B29/106;;Y10S707/99943;;G06F16/29;;G01C21/3867,G01C21/00;;G01C21/32;;G06F17/30;;G06T11/60;;G08G1/0968;;G08G1/0969;;G09B29/10,707/100;;701/207;;701/208;;340/990,6,3,106-417-932-466-271;;009-177-862-055-760;;049-147-765-298-545,10.1016/0734-189x(84)90215-9;;10.1109/tse.1979.234200;;10.1109/vnis.1994.396780,"Matsuyama et al., ""A File Organization for Geographic Information Systems Based on Spatial Proximity"" Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing 26:303-318 (1984).;;Frosh, Randy, ""A Method of Accessing Large Spatial Data-bases"", Nov. 26-30, 1989, GIS/LIS '89 Conference, Orlando, FL.;;Samet, Hanan, ""Strategies for Optimizing the Use of Redundancy in Spatial Databases"", Chapter 2.4, The Design and Analysis of Spatial Data Structure, ISGN 0-201-50255-0.

SOLUTION: An interface layer 41 is arranged between a navigation application software program 200 and a geographical data file 40, and it separates the navigation application software program 200 from the function of the geographical data file 40. The geographical data file 40 is stored on a storage medium 22 by a geographical dara set compiler. The compiler generates the output of a storage format shape. Since the layer 41 is arranged logically between the navigation application software program 200 and an operating system 202, it can respond to an access request from the navigation application software program 200. A software library for the layer 41 composed of the subsystem of the navigation application software program 200 searches and deforms the geographical data file 40 on the storage medium 22 regarding a requested entity so as to be returned to the navigation application software program 200.",NAVIGATION TECH CORP,ASHBY RICHARD A;;BOUZIDE PAUL M;;ISRANI VIJAY S;;LAMPERT DAVID S;;NATESAN SENTHIL K;;KILLEY GRANT S;;JASPER JOHN C;;ROBERT P FARNEKESS;;FEIGEN JERRY S,,https://lens.org/058-525-582-994-38X,Patent Application,no,0,13,11,33,0,G01C21/26;;G08G1/0969;;G09B29/106;;G06F16/29;;G01C21/3878;;G09B29/106;;G08G1/0969;;G01C21/26;;Y10S707/99943;;Y10S707/99932;;Y10S707/99942;;Y10S707/99931;;G06F16/29;;G01C21/3878,G09B29/00;;G01C21/00;;G01C21/26;;G01C21/32;;G06F12/00;;G06F17/30;;G08G1/0969;;G09B29/10,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The data access interface layer is preferably stored in the navigation system as a library of software functions. The data access interface layer operates in conjunction with the navigation system application software. The data access interface layer isolates the navigation application software from the geographic data which are stored on the storage medium. The data access interface layer intercepts requests by the navigation application software for geographic data. The data access interface layer retrieves geographic data from the storage medium and converts the data into a format usable by the navigation application software. The data access interface layer also provides for memory management that facilitates accessing and using geographic data from the particular storage medium quickly and efficiently. By recognizing that different media types have different physical formats, the data access interface layer accommodates and isolates the differences so that the portions of the data access interface layer that interact with the navigation application software can be generic.",NAVIGATION TECH CORP,ASHBY RICHARD A;;BOUZIDE PAUL M;;ISRANI VIJAYA S;;LAMPERT DAVID S;;NATESAN SENTHIL K;;KILLEY GRANT S;;JASPER JOHN C;;FERNEKES ROBERT P;;FEIGEN JERRY S,NAVTEQ NORTH AMERICA LLC (2004-05-10);;HERE GLOBAL B.V (2011-12-29);;NAVTEQ CORPORATION (2004-02-03),https://lens.org/149-679-928-071-808,Granted Patent,yes,31,83,11,33,0,G01C21/26;;G08G1/0969;;G09B29/106;;G06F16/29;;G01C21/3878;;G09B29/106;;G08G1/0969;;G01C21/26;;Y10S707/99943;;Y10S707/99932;;Y10S707/99942;;Y10S707/99931;;G06F16/29;;G01C21/3878,G09B29/00;;G01C21/00;;G01C21/26;;G01C21/32;;G06F12/00;;G06F17/30;;G08G1/0969;;G09B29/10,707/1;;701/208;;701/209;;345/440;;340/995,8,4,025-951-759-820-145;;066-204-998-561-660;;044-796-102-957-691;;062-151-435-683-742,10.1109/vnis.1993.585578;;10.1109/cmpsac.1991.170160;;10.1109/vnis.1994.396784;;10.1109/igarss.1996.516944,"Lee, Single Line Street Network: The Foundation of Mobile GIS, IEEE, pp. 34-37, (1993).;;Clementini, A Spatial Data Model Undrelying Human Interaction with Object Oriented Spatial Databases, IEEE, pp. 110-117, (1991).;;Masatoshi Arikawa, Personal Dynamic Maps Based on Distributed Geographic Information Servers, IEEE, pp. 591-596, (1994).;;Jordan, Dawn of a New Era: The Image Information Age, IEEE, pp. 2238-2230, (1996).;;Frosh, Randy.

The parcelization method also imparts a division sequence for facilitating address assignment and identification of the parcel. A common boundary set is used to limit all the spatial parcels (including a type such as a data set parcelized independently) so as to include one parcel within the other parcel completely, even in case of any type and any-two of spatial parcels. A data volume required for expressing a spatial parcel boundary within a global kd tree index is reduced by this manner. <P>COPYRIGHT: (C)2007,JPO&INPIT",NAVIGATION TECH CORP,ISRANI VIJAY S;;ASHBY RICHARD A;;BOUZIDE PAUL M;;JASPER JOHN C;;FERNEKES ROBERT P;;NYCZAK GREGORY M;;SMITH NICHOLAS E;;LAMPERT DAVID S;;MEEK JAMES A;;CRANE AARON I,,https://lens.org/065-096-961-455-117,Patent Application,no,9,3,19,33,0,G08G1/096827;;G08G1/0969;;G09B29/106;;G06F16/29;;G01C21/3867;;G08G1/096827;;G08G1/0969;;G09B29/106;;Y10S707/99943;;G06F16/29;;G01C21/3867,G01C21/00;;G01C21/32;;G06F17/30;;G06T11/60;;G08G1/0968;;G08G1/0969;;G09B29/00;;G09B29/10,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The engagement member is retained proximal to the aperture by a cord that obstructs the movement of the engagement member through the aperture. The engagement member is free to rotate and move within an area defined by the delivery system, allowing the implant to react to forces imparted to the implant by the movement of the delivery system and implant through a delivery catheter.
