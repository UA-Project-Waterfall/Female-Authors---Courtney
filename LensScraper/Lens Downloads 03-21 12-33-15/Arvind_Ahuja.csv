Ships today are propelled through water by using 'Internal Combustion Engines' which burn fuel and pollute the air with SOx, NOx, PM and CO2. To comply with IMO and USCG's regulations for reducing emissions of air pollutants, engines use Ultra-Low Sulphur fuels, Marine Gas Oils, or are being modified to burn LPG, LNG or Ethanol.
