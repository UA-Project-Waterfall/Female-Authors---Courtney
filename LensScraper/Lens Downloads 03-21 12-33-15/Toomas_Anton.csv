At class load time, the system injects executable software code that creates and displays the diagnostics information without necessarily having to stop and restart the executing server application. In response to user applications on user devices sending request messages for content from the server application, the system injects executable code into the application server that collects the diagnostics information, produces display components, and includes the diagnostics information within the display components. The server application then includes the display components and the requested content in response messages sent to the user devices. Preferably, the diagnostics information is presented in the same display context on the user device as the requested content, such as pages within a web browser. In examples, the diagnostics information includes enhanced call stack trace and memory profilers.",ZEROTURNAROUND AS,RÖMER TOOMAS;;KABANOV JEVGENI;;ARHIPOV ANTON,ZEROTURNAROUND AS (2015-05-05),https://lens.org/034-594-698-785-203,Patent Application,yes,23,18,3,3,0,H04L67/025;;G06F11/3624;;G06F11/3612;;G06F11/3644;;H04L67/75;;G06F11/3612;;G06F11/321;;G06F11/3644;;H04L67/025;;G06F11/3624;;H04L67/75,G06F11/36;;G06F11/32,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
