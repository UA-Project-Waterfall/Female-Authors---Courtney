A low and high probe are provided, each connected in the tank at the desired limit levels, and each connected to a comparator associated therewith. The output of each of the comparators are connected as inputs to an OR gate, which provides the control signal for activating a pump to pump liquid from the tank, and further provides a latching signal to the lower limit comparator, to keep that comparator latched in an off position until the upper limit comparator is triggered by liquid coming into contact with the upper limit probe. Once activated, the upper limit comparator causes the OR gate to produce a pump activation signal, in addition to unlatching the lower limit comparator, which in turn produces an OR gate activating signal which remains set until the pump evacuates the tank below the level of the lower limit probe, thereby deactivating the OR gate and the pump and whereby the process may be reinitiated.",MARLEY WYLAIN CO,ATKINS DONALD G,MARLEY COMPANY THE A CORP.

A header located at each end of the cylindrical shell is provided for feeding fluid to and from the tubes of the heat exchanger. Shrouds can be placed over the headers to affect hot gas turbulence and help minimize scaling. The surfaces of the cylindrical shell, when in un-scrubbed exhaust gas of an aluminum smelter, will be in contact with particles and/or dust and possibly caustic fumes and, therefore, may be treated with a relevant slip coating selected, for example, from the Teflon family.",ALCOA INC,BHATTACHARYYA RABINDRA KUMAR;;DANDO NEAL RICHARD;;ATKINS PATRICK R;;GAUDREAULT MARTIN;;SHOUP JEFFREY M;;WINTER ERIC F M;;ZIEGLER DONALD P,ALCOA INC (2008-07-29),https://lens.org/054-204-057-393-911,Patent Application,yes,13,6,2,2,0,C25C3/22;;C25C3/22;;F28D7/0041;;F28D7/0041;;F28D7/024;;F28D7/024;;F28F1/16;;F28F1/16;;F28F1/18;;F28F1/18;;F28F19/04;;F28F19/04,F28F1/10,165/172,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

A set (or sets) of visual stimuli is provided for visual presentation to the participant. A visual stimulus from the set is visually presented to the participant. The participant is required to respond to the visual stimulus. A determination is made regarding whether the participant responded correctly. The stimulus intensity of the visual stimuli presented may be adjusted based on the correctness/incorrectness of the participant's response according to a single-stair maximum likelihood (e.g., ZEST) or N-up/M-down procedure. The visually presenting, requiring, and determining are repeated one or more times in an iterative manner to improve the participant's cognition, e.g., ability to process visual information, memory, etc. Assessments may be performed during the repeating according to a dual-stair maximum likelihood (e.g., ZEST) or N-up/M-down procedure. The repeating may include performing multiple exercises using visual stimuli.",POSIT SCIENCE CORP,ATKINS SHARONA M;;BIRD DYLAN;;CHAN SAMUEL C;;DELAHUNT PETER B;;GANGADHAR SHRUTI;;HARDY JOSEPH L;;LISBERGER STEPHEN G;;MAHNCKE HENRY W;;MERZENICH MICHAEL M;;RICHARDS DONALD,POSIT SCIENCE CORPORATION (2007-01-30),https://lens.org/053-372-284-221-278,Patent Application,yes,18,161,3,38,0,G09B5/06;;G09B7/00;;G09B7/04;;G09B5/06;;G09B7/00;;G09B7/04,G09B19/00,434/236,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
