Such a deep AI catheter causes minimal discomfort and risk of trauma, and does not require the services of a highly trained AI professional. First, a catheter is inserted into the cervical tract of the animal. A membrane, initially positioned inside a tube section of the catheter, is then extended from an opening in the tube and into the tract under pressure. The membrane extends into the tract without friction thereby reducing the discomfort and the risk of trauma or injury to the animal. When the membrane is fully extended into the tract, pressure causes the tip of the membrane to open thereby releasing the AI fluid and depositing the genetic material suspended in the fluid into the reproductive tract. Deployment of the membrane is facilitated by tapering its wall thickness towards its tip.

Tal cateter (300) de IA profunda causa desconforto e risco de trauma mínimos, e não requer os serviços de um profissional de IA altamente capacitado. Primeiro, um cateter (300) é inserido no trato cervical do animal. Uma membrana (410), inicialmente posicionada no interior de uma seção tubular (420) do cateter (300), se estende de uma abertura (440) no tubo (420) até o trato sob pressão. A membrana (410) se estende dentro do trato sem atrito, reduzindo assim o desconforto e o risco de trauma ou lesão ao animal. Quando a membrana (410) está totalmente estendida no interior do trato, a pressão faz com que a extremidade (418) da membrana (410) se abra, dessa forma liberando o líquido de IA e depositando o material genético suspendido no líquido no interior do trato reprodutor. O posicionamento da membrana (410) é facilitado pelo estreitamento da espessura de sua parede em direção à extremidade (418).

The two fluids may be totally or partially soluble in one another or they may be totally insoluble in one another with the degree of solubility affecting the system's efficiency, but not its reliable operation. The refrigerant, which boils and condenses during the refrigeration cycle, is mixed with the coolant and condensed prior to the portion of the system's cycle in which the heat is rejected to a heat sink and is subsequently separated from the coolant.

One pliable member is used on the starboard side of the outboard motor while another is used on the port side. As the outboard motor is tilted about its trim axis, the two pliable members work in coordination with each other to exert a force on the outboard motor in a direction away from any direction in which the outboard motor is rotated about its steering axis as it is being tilted about its trim axis. This coordinated action by the two pliable members aligns the outboard motor in a straight ahead position when it is tilted upward into an inoperable position for transportation.

    A cowl latching system provides a retainer that is attached to the outboard motor and a catch device which is attached to a cowl structure. The catch device is shaped to allow the retainer to move between first and second extension portions. The retainer is provided with first and second retention members that can each move from a retracted position to an extended position under the urging of a resilient member such as a spring. The first and second retention members can also be urged from their respective extended positions to their respective retracted positions by the movement of the first and second extension portions of the catch device when the cowl structure is installed unto the outboard motor. The arrangement of the catch device and retainer simplifies the installation and removal of the cowl structure from the outboard motor by allowing the operator of a marine vessel to more easily and simply move the cowl structure relative to the stationary components of the outboard motor during both the installation and removal procedures.

The parallel system hybrid aircraft can takeoff with the internal combustion engine and climb to a cruising altitude. The internal combustion engine then can be turned off and the electric motor turned on to power the aircraft's propeller. The aircraft is capable of alternating operation between the electric motor and internal combustion engine as often as required at altitude. The aircraft can be landed using either the internal combustion engine or the electric motor. The transition of power from the internal combustion engine to the electric motor and back is performed through a hybrid clutch and pulley assembly that interconnects the internal combustion engine propeller flange to the propeller driveshaft. The electric motor is connected to the hybrid assembly through belts and sheaves.

This direction may be treated as a reference value, or “ground truth.” The captured image may be associated with the direction, and the combination may be used as training input into an application.",INTEL CORP,ANDERSON GLENN J;;RAFFA GIUSEPPE;;MARSHALL CARL S;;SHI MENG,INTEL CORPORATION (2017-06-29),https://lens.org/122-857-377-290-340,Patent Application,yes,0,7,6,6,0,A61B5/70;;G06F3/012;;G06F3/167;;G06F3/013;;G06V40/168;;G06V10/454;;G06V10/82;;G06V30/19173;;G06T7/70;;A61B5/70;;A61B90/361;;G06F3/012;;G06T2207/30196;;G06V10/454;;G06V40/168;;G06F18/24133;;G06V10/82;;G06V30/19173;;G06V30/194,G06T7/70;;A61B5/00;;A61B90/00;;G06F3/01;;G06K9/66,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Additionally, the template can include expected frame count values to aid the identification of the number of lost frames. Identification of the frame types in lost frames enables various error concealment algorithms to be implemented based on the picture type of the missing frames. The template of expected frame types or picture count values can be generated in a number of ways, such as known beforehand by an encoder due to a priori knowledge that the video encoder will be using a fixed GOP structure, or transmitted in the bitstream along with the video data, or the template can be generated in the decoder by having the GOP pattern deduced through analysis of the incoming video bitstream, for example.",THOMSON LICENSING;;ANDERSON DAVID BRIAN;;BOYCE JILL MACDONALD;;CASH GLENN L;;STEIN ALAN JAY,ANDERSON DAVID BRIAN;;BOYCE JILL MACDONALD;;CASH GLENN L;;STEIN ALAN JAY,,https://lens.org/134-017-709-283-619,Patent Application,yes,2,2,1,1,0,H04N19/895;;H04N19/89,H04N19/89;;H04N19/895,,1,0,,,"RICHARDSON I G: ""H.264/AVC Frame and picture management"", INTERNET CITATION, January 2004 (2004-01-01), XP002435299, Retrieved from the Internet <URL:http://www.rgu.ac.uk/files/avc_picmanagement_draft1.pdf> [retrieved on 20070529]",PENDING

The valve comprises a lower housing connected to a source of pressurized fuel and an upper housing connected to conduit means which extend to a dispensing nozzle. The upper housing has a groove which defines the plane of a weakened portion. When the impacted with a relatively high lateral force, the portion of the upper housing, above the groove, will separate, or break away. A normally open, main control, flapper valve is mounted in the lower housing. A poppet check valve is mounted in the upper housing. When the separable portion of the upper housing breaks away, both the flapper valve and the check valve automatically close to minimize spillage of fuel. A bleed valve is provided to relieve pressure in the fuel conduit means to which the separable portion of the upper housing is connected, in the event a fire occurs upon its breaking away. In one embodiment the check valve yieldingly engages a seat formed in the upper end of the upper housing, immediately above the notch and is opened by fuel flow pressure. In another embodiment the check valve is normally held open by a post projecting upwardly from a bridge mounted beneath the groove. In a third embodiment, the poppet valve is also held in an open position by a similar post and is engageable with a seat formed in the upper surface of the upper housing.

The valve comprises a lower housing connected to a source of pressurized fuel and an upper housing connected to conduit means which extend to a dispensing nozzle. The upper housing has a groove which defines the plane of a weakened portion. When the impacted with a relatively high lateral force, the portion of the upper housing, above the groove, will separate, or break away. A normally open, main control, flapper valve is mounted in the lower housing. A poppet check valve is mounted in the upper housing. When the separable portion of the upper housing breaks away, both the flapper valve and the check valve automatically close to minimize spillage of fuel. A bleed valve is provided to relieve pressure in the fuel conduit means to which the separable portion of the upper housing is connected, in the event a fire occurs upon its breaking away. In one embodiment the check valve yieldingly engages a seat formed in the upper end of the upper housing, immediately above the notch and is opened by fuel flow pressure. In another embodiment the check valve is normally held open by a post projecting upwardly from a bridge mounted beneath the groove. In a third embodiment, the poppet valve is also held in an open position by a similar post and is engageable with a seat formed in the upper staff ace of the upper housing. The upper housing and check valve comprises a replacement unit which can be mounted on existing lower housing to provide the benefits of the present invention or to replace an upper housing when an accident occurs.",DOVER CORP,MOORE GLENN E;;ANDERSON PAUL B;;WOOD CHESTER W;;BLASCH LAWRENCE R,DELAWARE CAPITOL FORMATION INC.

   This invention relates to methods and agonist/antagonist compounds for modulating melanocortin receptor-ligand binding. Also included is a method of identifying agonists and/or antagonists that bind to a ligand binding site for a melanocortin receptor of interest. Agonists and antagonists of ligand binding to melanocortin receptors also are provided. The invention is exemplified by identification and manipulation of the C-terminus of the human agouti related protein, which binds melanocortin receptors 3 and 4, and the production of AGRP peptidomimetics that are melanocortin receptor ligands. The methods can be applied to other melanocortin receptor agonists and antagonists.

Measurements may be performed on single cells or multicellular populations or tissues in the same assay at the same time.",UNIV ARIZONA STATE,KELBAUSKAS LAIMONAS;;GLENN HONOR;;HOUKAL JEFF;;ANDERSON CLIFFORD;;TIAN YANQING;;SU FENGYU;;MELDRUM DEIRDRE,,https://lens.org/002-538-330-894-885,Granted Patent,yes,54,0,3,3,0,B01L3/502753;;B01L3/502753;;B01L2200/0668;;B01L2200/0668;;B01L2400/086;;B01L2400/086;;C12M23/16;;C12M23/16;;C12M41/46;;C12M41/46;;C12Q1/02;;G01N33/48735;;G01N33/48735,B01L3/00;;B01L1/00;;C12M1/34;;C12M3/06;;C12Q1/02;;G01N33/487,,22,14,086-580-437-265-962;;065-356-538-970-312;;072-042-364-654-214;;059-213-331-975-954;;020-689-047-873-561;;029-420-212-070-398;;039-587-155-998-647;;003-421-549-287-518;;133-743-335-646-47X;;113-159-143-005-522;;030-221-548-663-596;;026-472-440-879-397;;020-012-980-490-969;;033-774-673-845-128,pmc2945354;;20822533;;10.1186/1478-811x-8-24;;10.1038/nrc1478;;15516961;;21376230;;10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013;;10.1038/srep45399;;pmc5368665;;28349963;;10.1038/srep44636;;28300162;;pmc5353596;;18456510;;10.1016/j.semcancer.2008.03.019;;10.1371/journal.pone.0026898;;22125602;;pmc3219641;;10.1021/ac100771r;;20392062;;10.1016/j.tig.2008.10.012;;19054589;;20849810;;10.1016/j.bbabio.2010.09.003;;10.1016/j.ejca.2009.12.006;;20044247;;18784658;;10.1038/nrc2499;;10.1053/j.gastro.2010.01.048;;pmc3422577;;20138038;;10.1016/j.tibtech.2010.03.002;;20434785;;pmc2876223,"Ashili, S.P. et al., “Automated platform for multiparameter stimulus response studies of metabolic activity at the single-cell level,” Proceedings of SPIE, vol. 7929, 2011, 12 pages.;;Calorini, L. et al., “Environmental control of invasiveness and metastatic dissemination of tumor cells: the role of tumor cell-host cell interactions,” Cell Communication and Signaling, vol. 8, Issue 1, Dec. 2010, 10 pages.;;Erez, N. et al., “Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Are Activated in Incipient Neoplasia to Orchestrate Tumor-Promoting Inflammation in an NF-κB-Dependent Manner,” Cancer Cell, vol. 17, Issue 2, Feb. 17, 2010, Elsevier Inc., pp. 135-147.;;Gatenby, R.A. et al., “Why Do Cancers Have High Aerobic Glycolysis?” Nature Reviews Cancer, vol. 4, Issue 11, Nov. 2004, pp. 891-899.;;Hanahan, D. et al., “Hallmarks of Cancer: The Next Generation,” Cell, vol. 144, Mar. 4, 2011, Elsevier Inc., pp. 646-674.;;Kelbauskas, L. et al., “A novel method for multiparameter physiological phenotype characterization at the single-cell level,” Proceedings of SPIE, vol. 7902, 2011, 9 pages.;;Kelbauskas, L. et al., “A platform for high-throughput bioenergy production phenotype characterization in single cells,” Scientific Reports, vol. 7, Article 45399, Mar. 28, 2017, 13 pages.;;Kelbauskas, L. et al., “Platform for combined analysis of functional and biomolecular phenotypes of the same cell,” Scientific Reports, vol. 7, Article 44636, Mar. 16, 2017, 11 pages.;;Laconi, E. et al., “The microenvironments of multistage carcinogenesis,” Seminars in Cancer Biology, vol. 18, Issue 5, 2008, Elsevier Ltd., pp. 322-329.;;Lahar, N. et al., “Intestinal Subepithelial Myofibroblasts Support in vitro and in vivo Growth of Human Small Intestinal Epithelium,” PLoS ONE, vol. 6, Issue 11, Nov. 17, 2011, 9 pages.;;Lovchik, R.D. et al., “Overflow Microfluidic Networks for Open and Closed Cell Cultures on Chip,” Analytical Chemistry, vol. 82, No. 9, May 1, 2010, American Chemical Society, pp. 3936-3942.;;Polyak, K. et al., “Co-evolution of tumor cells and their microenvironment,” Trends in Genetics, vol. 25, Issue 1, Jan. 2009, Elsevier Ltd., pp. 30-38.;;Solaini, G. et al., “Oxidative phosphorylation in cancer cells,” Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)—Bioenergetics, vol. 1807, Issue 6, 2011, Elsevier B.V., pp. 534-542.;;Staal, E. et al., “The stromal part of adenocarcinomas of the oesophagus: Does it conceal targets for therapy?” European Journal of Cancer, vol. 46, Issue 4, 2010, Elsevier Ltd., pp. 720-728.;;Visvader, J.E. et al., “Cancer stem cells in solid tumours: accumulating evidence and unresolved questions,” Nature Reviews Cancer, vol. 8, Issue 10, Oct. 2008, MacMillan Publishers Limited, pp. 755-768.;;Wang, D. et al., “Aberrant Epithelial-Mesenchymal Hedgehog Signaling Characterizes Barrett's Metaplasia,” Gastroenterology, vol. 138, Issue 5, May 2010, AGA Institute, pp. 1810-1822.;;Wang, D. et al., “Single cell analysis: the new frontier in ‘omics,’” Trends in Biotechnology, vol. 28, Issue 6, 2010, Elsevier Ltd., pp. 281-290.;;International Search Report and Written Opinion for International Patent Application No. PCT/US17/28884, dated Jul. 26, 2017, 10 pages.;;International Preliminary Report on Patentability for International Patent Application No. PCT/US17/28884, dated Nov. 1, 2018, 9 pages.;;U.S. Appl.

Optical fibers extend from the cable through a bore in a wedge (65) having a truncated conical shape and being received in the bushing. Portions of a strength member system (28) of the cable in the form of non-metallic filamentary strand material are captured between a wall which defines the tapered passageway and an outer surface of the wedge. The surfaces between which the strength members become locked are substantially smooth to avoid damage to the strength members. Forces applied to the cable and hence to the strength members cause the wedge to be seated further in the bushing. Also, the included angle between diametrically opposite lines on the surface of the wedge that lie in a plane that passes through the longitudinal axis of the wedge enhances the locking features of the connector. The fibers also extend through a retention nut (70) which is turned threadably over a threaded portion of the bushing and each fiber is connected to a truncated, conically shaped plug (94). The plugs are mounted adjacent to an end of the connector with one plug being received in an alignment sleeve (130). A sleeve retainer (140) is disposed over the sleeve and the other plug and includes alignment posts (145--145) so that when another connector is assembled thereto, a plug of the other connector is received in the unused end of the sleeve and a sleeve extending from another plug of the other connector receives the other plug of this connector.",AT & T BELL LAB,ANDERSON JERRY M;;CANNON JR THOMAS C;;DARDEN BRUCE V;;KALOMIRIS VASILIOS E;;THALLER GLENN A,FITEL USA CORPORATION (2001-11-16);;LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES INC (1996-03-29),https://lens.org/065-700-327-996-467,Granted Patent,yes,21,27,1,17,0,G02B6/3823;;G02B6/383;;G02B6/3869;;G02B6/3874;;G02B6/3878;;G02B6/3894;;G02B6/444;;G02B6/38875;;G02B6/3888;;G02B6/444;;G02B6/3894;;G02B6/3878;;G02B6/3874;;G02B6/383;;G02B6/3869;;G02B6/3823;;G02B6/38875;;G02B6/3888,G02B6/38;;G02B6/44,350/96.2;;350/96.21,3,0,,,"J.

Optical fibers extend through a bore in a wedge (65) having a truncated conical shape and being received in the bushing. Portions of non-metallic filamentary strength member (28) of the cable are captured between surfaces of a wall of the tapered passageway and the wedge which are substantially smooth to avoid damage to the strength members. Forces applied to the cable cause the wedge to be seated further in the bushing. The included angle between diametrically opposite lines on the wedge surface that lie in a plane passing through the longitudinal axis of the wedge enhances the locking features. The fibers also extend through a retention nut (70) which is turned threadably over a portion of the bushing and each fiber is connected to a plug (94) mounted adjacent to an end of the connector with one plug being received in an alignment sleeve (130). A retainer (140) is disposed over the sleeve and the other plug and includes alignment posts (145--145). When another connector is assembled hereto, a plug of the other connector is received in the unused end of the sleeve and a sleeve extending from another plug of the other connector receives the other plug of this connector.",AMERICAN TELEPHONE & TELEGRAPH,ANDERSON JERRY M;;CANNON JR THOMAS C;;DARDEN BRUCE V;;KALOMIRIS VASILIOS E;;THALLER GLENN A,AMERICAN TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH COMPANY A CORP.

A selection of N-acyl ciprofloxacin analogues, chemically synthesized from ciprofloxacin, have been tested in vitro for activity against Bartonella species as models for therapeutic development. Nine Bartonella strains, including five of B. henselae , two of B. quintana , and one each of B. elizabethae and B. vinsonii , have been tested for susceptibility to different N-acyl ciprofloxacin derivatives. Several techniques have been used to test the in vitro antibacterial activity of the derivatives. Seven of them, labeled RC4-125, RC4-143, RC4-147, RC5-28, RC5-29, RC5-32 and RC5-69 showed significant intracellular anti- Bartonella activity.

The bispecific antibodies may contain masking domains to minimize systemic toxicity. The masking domains are fused via protease-cleavable linkers to the Fab domains targeting human Cadherin-17 and CD3. The unmasking of the shielded bispecific antibodies occurs predominantly by proteases and enzymes in the tumor microenvironment. The application of such bispecific antibodies thereby minimizes systemic toxicity and expands the therapeutic index.",TAVOTEK BIOTECH SUZHOU LTD;;HANGZHOU UNOGEN BIOTECH LTD,CHEN YUANTING;;CHIU MARK L;;WHITAKER BRIAN;;TORNETTA MARK A;;FUNG MAN-CHEONG;;PU PU;;LIU CHENGDONG;;KWONG KENNETH CHEUNG;;YU AO;;ANDERSON GLENN MARK,,https://lens.org/015-619-177-250-712,Patent Application,yes,14,0,1,1,145,C07K16/28;;C07K16/2809;;C07K2317/31;;C07K2317/76;;C07K2317/569;;C07K2317/92,C07K16/28,,57,51,044-977-393-460-556;;078-202-077-775-45X;;061-519-730-880-032;;049-134-753-209-354;;029-063-485-174-667;;037-004-154-238-670;;132-106-825-670-677;;000-471-938-358-38X;;054-706-628-377-190;;078-432-639-041-575;;019-238-345-669-085;;125-915-249-748-160;;151-255-362-741-675;;121-933-557-429-536;;082-210-673-349-152;;096-864-027-367-04X;;040-624-104-970-711;;068-652-319-887-274;;087-989-123-391-00X;;011-386-112-367-266;;039-515-794-348-090;;005-444-556-699-101;;033-095-914-665-175;;056-912-397-985-227;;159-567-852-595-838;;065-541-145-986-772;;172-827-645-916-714;;020-126-213-879-311;;069-432-169-656-72X;;038-157-794-918-58X;;092-325-088-257-225;;027-228-275-474-389;;004-458-031-333-650;;047-193-062-179-608;;053-757-288-717-50X;;085-443-044-017-215;;062-508-220-526-343;;014-043-670-590-627;;005-090-172-223-707;;075-252-767-758-215;;051-993-750-407-758;;039-055-633-551-472;;010-869-000-317-651;;048-254-012-586-902;;022-394-339-031-336;;054-401-517-825-598;;124-422-310-739-465;;043-114-291-493-998;;027-367-233-681-03X;;040-307-220-582-194;;007-879-830-761-189,10.1080/19420862.2016.1268307;;28071970;;pmc5297537;;33466732;;pmc7829968;;10.3390/cancers13020287;;10.1002/eji.1830230216;;8436176;;10.1016/0022-2836(87)90412-8;;3681981;;10.5858/arpa.2015-0404-oa;;27763792;;28029907;;30783124;;10.1038/s41598-018-37259-2;;pmc6381129;;10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-17-1444;;28916526;;10.1016/j.addr.2012.09.039;;pmc3726540;;23026637;;10.1016/j.molimm.2008.06.027;;18691763;;10.1074/jbc.m604292200;;16793771;;10.1126/science.1248943;;24626930;;pmc4250092;;10.1007/s10620-006-9316-9;;17226075;;10.1074/jbc.m110.117382;;pmc2885242;;20400508;;10.1002/ijc.25423;;pmc2958458;;20473913;;10.4049/jimmunol.176.1.346;;16365427;;pmc3829399;;23986451;;10.1074/jbc.m113.486142;;10.1016/s0006-291x(04)00996-9;;15178443;;10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.04.197;;29474162;;10.1089/mab.2017.0043;;10.1073/pnas.1220145110;;23479652;;pmc3612680;;10.1053/j.gastro.2010.04.008;;pmc2917327;;20398667;;10.1016/s0145-305x(02)00039-3;;12477501;;27909714;;10.3892/ijo.2016.3783;;pmc5182006;;10.1186/s12929-020-00652-z;;32586313;;pmc7318374;;pmc3896370;;24465527;;10.1371/journal.pone.0085296;;31004701;;10.1016/j.canlet.2019.04.022;;pmc2906601;;20616015;;10.1073/pnas.1000976107;;29084915;;10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-17-2823;;17077181;;10.1093/intimm/dxl110;;10.1182/blood-2020-136295;;23554857;;pmc3598811;;10.1371/journal.pone.0056959;;8844834;;10.1093/protein/9.7.617;;10.1002/bip.20890;;18008324;;pmc2760957;;11096108;;10.1074/jbc.m009483200;;10.1038/s41416-020-01225-5;;33469153;;pmc7960983;;25388236;;10.1111/his.12610;;10.1073/pnas.0400782101;;15075390;;pmc395923;;18552820;;10.1038/modpathol.2008.107;;25972002;;10.1126/scitranslmed.aaa4802;;12824888;;10.1111/j.1349-7006.2003.tb01459.x;;pmc6698826;;31548527;;10.3390/antib6030012;;10.1016/j.biopha.2018.09.020;;30227326;;10.1016/j.ymeth.2013.06.035;;23872058;;10.1038/nrc3647;;24442140;;10.1182/blood-2015-06-651380;;26755709;;pmc4797019;;10.1016/j.bbrc.2003.10.032;;14623315;;11162109;;10.1006/jmbi.2000.4265;;pmc4702805;;10.1093/nar/gkv1104;;26578587;;pmc2138737;;5508247;;10.1084/jem.132.2.211;;10716879;;10.1006/cimm.2000.1617;;10.1038/nbt.1601;;pmc2855492;;20081867;;28758875;;pmc5627589;;10.1080/19420862.2017.1358838,"ULRICH BRINKMANN ET AL: ""The making of bispecific antibodies"", MABS, vol. 9, no. 2, 10 January 2017 (2017-01-10), US, pages 182 - 212, XP055531122, ISSN: 1942-0862, DOI: 10.1080/19420862.2016.1268307;;MIDDELBURG JIM ET AL: ""Overcoming Challenges for CD3-Bispecific Antibody Therapy in Solid Tumors"", CANCERS, vol. 13, no. 2, 1 January 2021 (2021-01-01), pages 287, XP055981857, Retrieved from the Internet <URL:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7829968/pdf/cancers-13-00287.pdf> DOI: 10.3390/cancers13020287;;""GenBank"", Database accession no.

    A method of key distribution includes generating, by a first system device ( 101 ), key material and forwarding the key material from the first system device ( 101 ) to a second system device ( 107 ). It is determined whether a mobile station ( 401 ), for which the key material is directed, is active on the system. When the mobile station is active, the key material is forwarded to a base station ( 115 ) where the mobile station ( 401 ) is active, and the base station ( 115 ) forwards the key material to the mobile station ( 401 ).

    Changes in locking configurations are managed. A locking configuration includes one or more locking facilities and the one or more locking facilities include one or more locks. When a change in a locking configuration, either planned or unplanned, is detected, one or more of the locks are redistributed. For example, one or more of the locks affected by the change are moved from one or more of the locking facilities to one or more other locking facilities. This redistribution is independent of the location of the data associated with the one or more locks being moved. Thus, data and locks may be moved independently of one another and without affecting one another. Further, the redistribution can take place while the system is available or mostly available, thereby minimizing downtime.

A number of audio drivers can be radially distributed within a speaker housing so that an output of the drivers is distributed evenly throughout the room. In some embodiments, the exit geometry of the audio drivers can be configured to bounce off a surface supporting the array speaker to improve the distribution of music throughout the room. The array speaker can include a number of vibration isolation elements distributed within a housing of the array speaker. The vibration isolation elements can be configured reduce the strength of forces generated by a subwoofer of the array speaker.
