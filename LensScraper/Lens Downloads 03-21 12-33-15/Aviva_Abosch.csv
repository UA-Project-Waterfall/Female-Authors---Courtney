Some embodiments, for example, may use subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat advanced Parkinsons Disease motor symptoms and improve sleep by identifying sleep stages commensurate with clinician-scored polysomnography (PSG). The DBS may be adapted to include novel artificial neural network (ANN) that triggers targeted stimulation in response to inferred sleep state from STN local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from implanted DBS electrodes. A feedforward neural network can be trained to prospectively identify sleep stage with PSG-level accuracy. In some embodiments, the machine learning model stored within the DB S may also adapt stimulation during specific sleep stages to treat targeted sleep deficits.",UNIV COLORADO REGENTS,ZYLBERBERG JOEL;;CHRISTENSEN ELIJAH;;THOMPSON JOHN;;ABOSCH AVIVA,THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO A BODY CORPORATE (2019-11-14),https://lens.org/007-177-813-878-282,Patent Application,yes,0,6,2,2,0,A61N1/00;;A61N1/36067;;A61N1/36078;;A61N1/36139;;A61N1/0534;;A61N1/36078;;A61N1/36082;;A61N1/36139;;A61N1/378,A61N1/36;;A61N1/05;;A61N1/378,,0,0,,,,PENDING
