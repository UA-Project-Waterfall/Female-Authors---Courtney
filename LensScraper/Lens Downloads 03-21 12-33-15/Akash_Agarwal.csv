The objective of present invention is to solve the anomalies presented in the prior art techniques and technologies related to healthcare monitor of patient who has recovered for the covid-19 disease. The disclosure presents a block chain integrated remote post covid patient monitoring which is machine learning and Biomedical sensor based smart wearable devices for collecting various physiological and health related parameters of the patient. Its aim is to help remotely living post covid patient to gain access to healthcare units seamlessly and avail services without time and geographical restrictions. The invention is integrated with block chain technology in order to make sensitive healthcare transactions immutable leading to data integrity and non repudiation. Further, the system is equipped enough with machine learning models to infer the data available and detect any abnormal pattern related to health issues. It has provision to capture post covid patient vital signs and send to doctors. The mobile application or user interface pulls data from the machine learning model based central server and showed to doctor from time to time. Thus, doctor can view post covid patient health details and support near real-time monitoring and treatment to save lives of post covid patient besides their valuable time and effort. In this way, the monitoring of post covid recovered patient becomes easy patient and family can be avoided from harm of lives.
