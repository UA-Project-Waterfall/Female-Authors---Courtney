In one embodiment, the dispensing system includes a wet wipe container and a lotion container that is held in assembly with the wet wipe container that contains a lotion that is kept separate from the wet wipes until the wet wipe is dispensed from the wet wipe container. The lotion includes a microencapsulated delivery vehicle that contains a temperature change agent that is capable of generating a temperature change upon contact with an aqueous solution. Once the wet wipe is dispensed from the system, an applicating device can apply the lotion to the wet wipe to facilitate contact between the temperature change agent in the microencapsulated delivery vehicle and the aqueous solution of the wet wipe.",KIMBERLY CLARK CO;;AMUNDSON JOHN DAVID;;ABUTO FRANK P;;CLARE TIMOTHY P;;FOLEY EDWARD JOHN;;WINDER ERIC MICHAEL;;SCHMIDT PAUL R;;JOSEPH WAEL R;;MCDONALD DUANE LYLE,AMUNDSON JOHN DAVID;;ABUTO FRANK P;;CLARE TIMOTHY P;;FOLEY EDWARD JOHN;;WINDER ERIC MICHAEL;;SCHMIDT PAUL R;;JOSEPH WAEL R;;MCDONALD DUANE LYLE,,https://lens.org/164-495-744-538-597,Patent Application,yes,0,13,6,6,0,A47K10/421;;A47K2010/328;;A47K2010/3293;;A61F7/032;;A61F2007/0098;;A61F2007/0292;;F28D20/023;;Y02E60/14;;A47K10/421;;A47K2010/3293;;F28D20/023;;A61F2007/0292;;A47K2010/328;;A61F7/032;;A61F2007/0098;;Y02E60/14,,,0,0,,,,PENDING
