INDUSTRIAL INSTRUMENTS Ltd. 14 Aug., 1967 [13 May, 1966], No. 21438/66. Heading H2F. In a waveform synthesizer of the type shown in Fig. 2 for building up a sinusoidal waveform from pulses, the spacing between pulses (Fig. 4) is adjustable so as to control the mean output voltage. A system is described for synthesizing a waveform having a number of preselected odd harmonics, at least the fundamental and third harmonic being synthesized by circuits of the type shown. Fig. 3 shows the trigger pulse generator for the thyristors of the fundamental frequency synthesizer of Fig. 2. The frequency is determined by a sawtooth oscillator 1 having eighteen times the required fundamental frequency and triggering a bi-stable 2 giving inverse pulses at nine times the required frequency to trigger thyristors 1A, 1B. A ring counter and logic circuits provide further pulses at nine times the required frequency to trigger the appropriate thyristors 1 . . . 10 which determine the magnitude of each step in the output waveform of Fig. 4. The filtered output is rectified at 6 and compared with the instantaneous value of the sawtooth wave from 1 in a differential amplifier 5 the output of which is fed to AND gates Y so as to control the firing time of thyristors 1 . . . 10 and hence the spacing between the segments. The output voltage is thus regulated. Figs. 5, 6 (not shown), show a simpler inverter for the third harmonic. Simple square wave inverters are employed for the other harmonics, all inverters being controlled from a master oscillator and frequency dividers (Fig. 1, not shown). In Fig. 7 (not shown), the outputs of all inverters are combined in series, a potentiometer being included between the mains input to the rectifiers supplying the respective inverters so as to adjust the proportion of each harmonic in the composite waveform. The fundamental frequency of the composite waveform can be adjusted from 40 c/s. to 500 c/s. by adjustment of the frequency of the master oscillator (Fig. 1, not shown).",IND INSTR LTD,PEDDER DONALD AUSTIN GRANT,,https://lens.org/193-001-654-280-771,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H03K5/02,H03K5/02,H2F FDACS         FDACS;;H2F FSF           F9B2;;H2F F10           -;;H2F F9B2          -;;H2F F9KX          -;;H2F F9K1          -;;H2F F9K11         -;;H2F F9K12         -;;H2F F9K7          -;;H2F F9K9          -;;H2F F9L3          -;;H2F F9N1B2        -;;H2F F9N2A         -;;H2F F9N3X         -;;H2F F9N4B         -;;H2F F9PX          -;;H2F F9R28B        -;;H2F F9R39C        F9B2;;H2F F9S2          -;;H2F F9T2          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In a 3 phase static invertor, as shown, Fig. 1, after an initial starting period the charging and discharging of commutation capacitors takes place through the load, to substantially reduce energy loss. In operation, initially, thyristors 1, 2, 5, 6, 11 and 12 are gated to conduct simultaneously and supply the load (the conduction periods being indicated in Fig. 2, relative to secondary firing pulses for the commutation of conducting thyristors and which are applied to turn ON thyristors 9 and 10 during this period). Thyristor 10 is fired at the instant indicated so that point R is connected to the negative supply line. Thus commutation capacitors C2, C3 are charged through 5, 10, 11, 12 and 1, 10, 11, 12 respectively, points P, Q becoming positive with respect to R, by a voltage equal to the supply voltage. Subsequently Th9 receives a drive pulse and connects C3, C2 to the positive supply line so that thyristors 1 and 5 are reverse biased and turn off. Load current now flows via 9, C3, 2, load, 11, 12 and via 9, C2, 6, load, 11, 12, in the interval between switching off 1 and 5 and the new conduction period. The current flow through C2, C3, during this commutation interval, falls as each capacitor is first discharged and recharged in opposite directions. Thyristors 2, 6, 11, 12 cease to conduct when the current falls below a holding value. At the start of the next conduction period after commutation is complete, thyristors 1, 2, 7, 8, 11, 12 are gated and turn on. Two sets of thyristors connected to the negative line are now conducting and the next commutation will involve the negative side thyristors, the procedure similar to the above being repeated.",IND INSTR LTD,PEDDER DONALD AUSTIN GRANT,,https://lens.org/084-190-206-306-644,Granted Patent,no,0,3,1,1,0,H02M7/515,H02M7/515,H2F FSQ           FSQ;;H2F FSQ           F9B2;;H2F F9B2          -;;H2F F9F1          -;;H2F F9F6          -;;H2F F9K10         -;;H2F F9L2          -;;H2F F9P1          -;;H2F F9T2          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The voltage supply capacitor (124) is normally charged by an AC voltage which is derived from the furnace and which is rectified by a full wave rectifier bridge (126). Time and temperature data are stored in read/write RAM storage (79). The microcomputer (48) controls operation of the thermostat (10) as a function of sensed temperature and the stored time and temperature data. A voltage sensing circuit (136) senses the supply voltage from the voltage supply capacitor (124) and prevents the supply voltage from being provided to the microcomputer (48) and other portions of the thermostat control circuitry when a prolonged interruption of AC power causes the supply voltage to decrease to a predetermined value. The supply voltage continues to be supplied to the read/write RAM (79) to retain the stored time and temperature data. When AC power is restored, and the voltage supply capacitor (124) is recharged, the digital thermostat (10) is ready to resume operation without requiring the user to re-enter all of the stored time and temperature data. The capacitance of the voltage supply capacitor (124) is sufficiently large to allow the capacitor (124) to supply the current needed to retain the stored time and temperature data in the RAM (79) through prolonged power interruptions without the need for a backup battery.",MICROCOMM CORP,HENDRICKS DONALD B;;LARSON AUSTIN R,,https://lens.org/057-949-787-590-453,Patent Application,yes,4,3,3,3,0,G06F1/30;;G06F1/30;;G05D23/1917;;G05D23/1917,G05D23/19;;G06F1/30,G4A AEP           EP;;H2H HSS           SS;;H2H H22G          SS;;H2H H24G          SS;;H2H H25G          SS;;U1S S1967;;U1S S1970;;U1S S2183;;U1S S2198,0,0,,,,PENDING

The voltage supply capacitor is normally charged by an AC voltage which is derived from the furnace and which is rectified by a full wave rectifier bridge. Time and temperature data are stored in read/write RAM storage. The microcomputer controls operation of the thermostat as a function of sensed temperature and the stored time and temperature data. A voltage sensing circuit senses the supply voltage from the voltage supply capacitor and prevents the supply voltage from being provided to the microcomputer and other portions of the thermostat control circuitry when a prolonged interruption of AC power causes the supply voltage to decrease to a predetermined value. The supply voltage continues to be supplied to the read/write RAM to retain the stored time and temperature data. When AC power is restored, and the voltage supply capacitor is recharged, the digital thermostat is ready to resume operation without requiring the user to re-enter all of the stored time and temperature data. The capacitance of the voltage supply capacitor is sufficiently large to allow the capacitor to supply the current needed to retain the stored time and temperature data in the RAM through prolonged power interruptions without the need for a backup battery.",MICROCOMM CORP,HENDRICKS DONALD B;;LARSON AUSTIN R,CALABRIA JOSEPH (1984-03-27);;MICROCOMM CORPORATION A MN CORP (1984-08-27);;WARGO PETER (1984-03-27);;MICROCOMM CORPORATION (1982-11-01),https://lens.org/112-775-819-492-096,Granted Patent,yes,15,174,3,3,0,G06F1/30;;G06F1/30;;G05D23/1917;;G05D23/1917,G05D23/19;;G06F1/30,236 46R;;364/844;;365/229,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Le micro-ordinateur (48) commande le fonctionnement du thermostat (10) en fonction de la température détectée et des données concernant le temps et la température. Un circuit détecteur de tension (136) détecte la tension d'alimentation provenant du condensateur d'alimentation en tension (124) et coupe la tension d'alimentation du micro-ordinateur (48) et d'autres parties du circuit de commande du thermostat lorsqu'une interruption prolongée de l'alimentation à courant alternatif provoque une diminution jusqu'à une valeur prédéterminée de la tension d'alimentation.

INDUSTRIAL INSTRUMENTS Ltd., and LAURENCE, SCOTT & ELECTROMOTORS Ltd. 11 Oct., 1967 [17 Aug., 1966], No. 36895/66. Heading H2J. A power supply circuit for an A.C. motor comprises an inverter 13 and a rectifier 21, signals representing respectively the switching frequency of the inverter, and the input voltage thereto from the rectifier, being compared to obtain a control signal. This signal controls the firing angle of the rectifier so that changes in the output frequency of the inverter are matched by corresponding changes in the input to the inverter, whereby the motor operates at at a steady torque. The inverter frequency is set by oscillator 10 which drives trigger and pulse distribution circuits 22 for a pair of primary switching thyristors. A converter 12 passes a voltage signal, proportional to the frequency, to a differential amplifier 11 which receives a second input from the D.C. line to the inverter. A signal which is proportional to the difference between the inputs is fed to a coincidence comparator 14 which also receives a ramp waveform signal from generator 15 driven by pulse generator 16. An output pulse is passed to stage 17 from the comparator 14 when the ramp voltage reaches the difference voltage. Inhibit signals along lines 18, 19 ensure that output pulses from the stage 17 to a firing circuit 20 are synchronized with the A.C. input to the rectifier circuit 21. The circuit 20 controls the point at which a thyristor in the rectifier circuit is fired and, hence, the level of the output voltage from the rectifier.",IND INSTR LTD;;SCOTT L & ELECTROMOTORS LTD,PEDDER DONALD AUSTIN GRANT;;KIRYLUK WLODZIMIERZ;;BERMAN LAWRENCE JOHN,,https://lens.org/089-533-031-704-184,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,H02P27/06;;H02M5/4505;;H02M7/1626;;H02P27/047;;H02P2201/03,H02M5/45;;H02M7/162;;H02P27/06,H2F FMAS          FMAS;;H2F FSRA          FSRA;;H2F F9J18         FSRA;;H2F F9KX          FSRA;;H2F F9K7          FSRA;;H2F F9N1B1        FSRA;;H2F F9R19C        FSRA;;H2F F9T4A         FSRA;;H2J J1D2          -;;H2J J1J           -;;H2J J1U           -;;H2J J1X           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

An induction motor is supplied through an inverter whose output frequency is controlled in response to a D.C. reference signal which is over-ridden to increase the frequency when the motor tends to regenerate. An oscillator 11 controls the frequency of firing pulses applied to thyristors included in the inverter, the oscillator being regulated normally by a reference voltage derived from a potentiometer VR. When the motor regenerates, transistor TRI is switched off and an over-riding H.T. signal is applied to the oscillator through diode D1, diode D2 being blocked. The increased voltage is applied to the oscillator to increase its output frequency until the motor ceases to regenerate and the inhibiting signal is removed from the base of the transistor TRI. A further over-ride signal is obtained during the starting operation of the motor, a switch SI being opened, whereby capacitor C2 is charged through resistors R2, R4. The voltage applied to the oscillator increases until diode D3 is reversed biased and the potentiometer VR takes over the control.",IND INSTR LTD;;SCOTT L & ELECTROMOTORS LTD,KIRYLUK WLODZIMIERZ;;BERMAN LAWRENCE JOHN;;PEDDER DONALD AUSTIN GRANT,,https://lens.org/186-964-137-577-33X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H02P27/06,H02P27/06,H2J JCA           JCA;;H2J JSVF          JSVF;;H2J J1J           -;;H2J J1N1          -;;H2J J1X           -;;H2J J12D          -;;H2J J12N3A        J1N1;;H2J J12N3B        J1N1;;H2J J12N3Y        J1N1,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The assembly comprises an air delivery mechanism comprising one or more apertures for an air chamber positioned directly below the material travel path. Aligning the one or more apertures with the axis of the laser beam and its focal point when the material is positioned above the one or more apertures and pressurizing or filling of the open cells with air in the direct vicinity of the target area reduces processing related discoloration of the material. The cells are laser processed concurrently with pressurization thereby substantially reducing settling of debris and smoke on the material and reducing discoloration.

In a supply capacitor commutated inverter circuit including a first main controlled rectifier SCR1 in series with a choke LA, the primary winding of a transformer T1 and rectifier means such as a diode D1, the circuit is arranged so that a reversal of voltage occurs across the choke LA as the charge across the commutating capacitor C reaches the supply voltage following commutation of a second main controlled rectifier SCR3 and the rectifier means D1 is forward biased on firing the first controlled rectifier SCR1 to commence a new inverter half cycle so as to effectively clamp the supply voltage E across the choke LA such that energy stored in the choke during commutation is fed back to the supply. The thyristor pairs SCR1, SCR2 and SCR3, SCR4 are fired alternately to provide a squarewave output to the load. If SCR5 is fired to commutate SCR3, SCR4 and considering SCR3 only, the voltage at point A drops sharply to commutate SCR3 but begins to rise towards the supply voltage E as the capacitor C is charged in the reverse direction. When it reaches the supply voltage SCR1 is fired and as the voltage across LA continues to rise the diode D1 becomes forward biased and the voltage across the choke LA occurs across the primary winding of the autotransformer T1. The voltage now occurring across the secondary of T1 forward biases diodes D1 and D2 and clamps the supply voltage E across the secondary winding. This effectively clamps the supply voltage across the choke LA and excess commutation current from the circuit including the choke LA and primary winding of T1 is fed back into the supply. When the voltage across the choke LA falls to its normal operating value the diode D1 becomes blocked and the energy recovery is completed. The diodes D3 and D4 provide path for the reactive load current when the main thyristors are non-conducting. The operation of the lower part of the circuit including choke LB and transformer T2 is similar to the above.",IND INSTR LTD;;SCOTT L & ELECTROMOTORS LTD,KIRYLUK WLODZIMIERZ;;BERMAN LAWRENCE JOHN;;PEDDER DONALD AUSTIN GRANT,,https://lens.org/192-283-798-329-732,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,H02M7/5152,H02M7/515,H2F FSQ           FSQ;;H2F FSQ           F9B2;;H2F F9B2          -;;H2F F9FX          -;;H2F F9F1          -;;H2F F9F3          -;;H2F F9F5          -;;H2F F9F7          F9B2;;H2F F9J18         -;;H2F F9KX          -;;H2F F9R10B        -;;H2F F9R20B        -;;H2F F9R26B        -;;H2F F9R42B        -;;H2F F9S1          -;;H2F F9T2          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Based on each recovery log, a value for a Full Recoveries Per Hour (FRPH) metric is determined for each read-write head of each respective HDD. Generally, the FRPH metric characterizes the amount of time a head has spent performing recovery operations. In response to a particular head FRPH reaching a pre-determined threshold value, an in-situ repair can be determined for the HDD in which the head operates.

In response to a particular DSD reaching a predetermined threshold QoS value, an in-situ repair may be determined for the particular DSD or the particular DSD may be added to a list of candidate DSDs for further examination, which may include an FRPH examination for suitably configured DSDs.",WESTERN DIGITAL TECH INC,LESTER ROBERT;;STRIEGEL AUSTIN;;TESONE JARED;;LIEBER TIMOTHY;;RICHARDSON EVAN;;PENZA DONALD,,https://lens.org/011-442-374-801-097,Patent Application,yes,6,0,5,10,0,G06F11/1076;;G06F11/0793;;G06F11/079;;G06F11/2094;;G06F11/1471;;G06F11/0754;;G06F11/0772;;G06F11/3034;;G06F11/076;;G06F11/0772;;G06F11/1076;;G06F11/0793;;G06F11/1471;;G06F3/0652;;G06F11/3034;;G06F3/0619;;G06F3/0653;;G06F3/0689;;G06F3/0658;;G06F11/2053,G06F11/30;;G11C29/56;;G11B20/18,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Then, the first data matrix provides the means for stepping through the second data matrix to create a private key. Next, the private key is erased immediately after the private key is created and used in a cryptography process for accessing secure data.

This mounting method uses extremely slender stators that connect the duct ring to the propulsor which is mounted in the middle and drives the rotor, fan or propeller. The slender stators take the form of spokes and as such are so slender that the midspan stresses within the spokes are dominated by axial tension loads rather than the shear loads experienced by conventional stators.

Bidirectional buffers isolate data buses from the control bus, thereby allowing control to be maintained by an 8-bit programmed microprocessor. The controller microprocessor does not handle image data thereby reducing complex software and support components required of prior multiple 16- and 32-bit microprocessor controller systems. Isolation is achieved by having multiple data buses handling image data at various stages of processing, such as, for example, input image data, compressed image data and output image data. Additional efficiencies are realized by eliminating the inherent delays caused when high speed image output terminals are forced to share data buses with much lower speed image input terminals.",XEROX CORP,WEGENG DONALD L;;CARTER JEFF C;;WARD JOSEPH W;;BEAMAN THOMAS G;;SOSINSKI GREGORY C;;AUSTIN TODD M,XEROX CORPORATION (1993-06-09),https://lens.org/083-456-070-879-96X,Granted Patent,yes,12,39,3,3,0,H04N1/32603;;H04N1/32603;;H04N1/00204;;H04N1/00204;;H04N1/32561;;H04N1/32561;;H04N2201/0081;;H04N2201/0081;;H04N2201/0082;;H04N2201/0082;;H04N2201/0087;;H04N2201/0087,G03G15/00;;G06F13/36;;G06T1/60;;G06T9/00;;H04N1/00;;H04N1/32,358/408;;358/406;;395/162;;345/190,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In one aspect of the present invention, the method comprises the steps of: (1) setting a diverter at a prescribed position and a prescribed orientation in a main well flow conductor located within a main wellbore, (2) boring through a sidewall of the main well flow conductor and into a material surrounding the main well flow conductor, the boring creating a window having a particular shape in the sidewall, the orientation of the diverter determining a lateral position of the window in the main well flow conductor, a lateral wellbore thereby being formed in the material and extending from the main wellbore, (3) lining the lateral wellbore with a liner, the liner having an interface end, the interface end adapted to contact a periphery of the window in the sidewall and (4) cementing the liner in place within the lateral wellbore, the step of cementing creating a pressure-bearing seal between the periphery of the window and the interface end of the liner. The method allows multiple lateral wellbores to be joined to the main wellbore and provides for connectivity among main and lateral wellbores, pressure-bearing sealing of joints to allow selective isolation of one or more wellbores or portions thereof and subsequent wellbore access for rework or other purposes.",LONGBOTTOM JAMES R;;COX DON C;;GANO JOHN C;;WELCH WILLIAM R;;WHITE PAT M;;NIVENS HAROLD WAYNE;;JACQUIER RICHARD CHARLES;;HOLBROOK PAUL DAVID;;FREEMAN TOMMIE AUSTIN;;MILLS DAVID H;;SETTERBERG JOHN RICHARD;;MCDONALD DONALD,LONGBOTTOM JAMES R;;COX DON C;;GANO JOHN C;;WELCH WILLIAM R;;WHITE PAT M;;NIVENS HAROLD WAYNE;;JACQUIER RICHARD CHARLES;;HOLBROOK PAUL DAVID;;FREEMAN TOMMIE AUSTIN;;MILLS DAVID H;;SETTERBERG JOHN RICHARD;;MCDONALD DONALD,,https://lens.org/006-066-627-290-217,Patent Application,no,0,0,23,73,0,E21B7/061;;E21B17/00;;E21B17/10;;E21B17/1007;;E21B17/22;;E21B23/00;;E21B23/02;;E21B23/03;;E21B29/06;;E21B33/1293;;E21B33/1295;;E21B41/0042;;E21B43/10;;F16L7/00;;F16L9/16;;E21B23/12;;E21B29/06;;E21B7/061;;E21B41/0042;;E21B33/1293;;E21B17/00;;E21B43/10;;E21B17/22;;E21B17/1007;;F16L7/00;;E21B23/03;;E21B23/00;;E21B23/02;;F16L9/16;;E21B33/1295;;E21B17/10;;E21B23/12,E21B7/06;;E21B7/08;;E21B17/00;;E21B17/10;;E21B17/22;;E21B23/00;;E21B23/02;;E21B23/03;;E21B23/12;;E21B29/06;;E21B33/129;;E21B33/1295;;E21B41/00;;E21B43/10;;F16L7/00;;F16L9/16,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A method of embossing a sheet material includes: heating at least a portion of the sheet directly or indirectly with radiant energy from a radiant energy source; pressing a tool against the heated portion of the sheet, thereby patterning a surface of the sheet; and separating the sheet and the tool. The radiant energy may travel through a solid material that is relatively transparent to radiation, on its way to being absorbed by a relatively-absorptive material. The relatively-transparent material may be an unheated portion of the sheet, and the relatively-absorptive material may be either the tool or the heated portion of the sheet. Alternatively, the relatively-transparent material may be the tool, and the relatively-absorptive material may be all or part of the sheet. The method may be performed as one or more roll-to-roll operations.
