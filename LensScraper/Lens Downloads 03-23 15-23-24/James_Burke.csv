Motors, controlling. - An alternating - current motor B, supplied from constant-pressure terminals 1, 2, is started by current from the secondary 42, 43 of a pressure-reducing transformer C. The motor is at first connected with this secondary through the coil of a magnet 39, contacts 31, 32, and a connecting-blade 33 held by a latch 34 ; the blade and latch are so placed by holding the upper end of a lever a' to the left, the latch being afterwards held down by attraction of the magnet 39. At the same time current is supplied to the primary 28, 29 of the transformer through contacts 4, 5, an insulated connecting- arm a, resistances 19, a switch 25, a contact 26, contacts 30, 31, and the arm 33. The upper end of the lever a' is then turned to the right, gradually cutting out the resistance from the primary circuit, and closing this circuit at 5, while opening it at 25, 26 in the position shown. After this the motor is also connected directly with the terminals 1, 2, through contacts 4, 13, all the resistances 19, the switch 25, and a contact 27. On further motion of the lever a<1>, the resistance is gradually removed from the motor circuit ; this reduces the transformer currents until the magnet 39 is unable to hold the latch 34 against the pull of a spring 41, and releases it and the blade 33, which is moved by another spring and opens the secondary circuit 42, 43 at the contacts 31, 32, leaving the motor B connected with the terminals 1, 2. The connections may be slightly modified, and separate resistances may be used in the transformer and motor circuits. A contact-plate 52 is provided on the lever a' for short-circuiting the motor through contacts 50, 53 in the stop position of the lever The invention is applicable to continuous-current motors, the transformer C being any suitable converter.",BURKE JAMES,BURKE JAMES,,https://lens.org/152-539-217-006-982,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The laminµ 2, Fig. 1, are clamped between end plates 3, 4, one of which bears against a shoulder 5 on the shaft 1. A collar 6, made of a malleable metal or alloy, such as wrought iron, soft steel, brass, &c., is slipped over the shaft, and, while the laminµ are pressed tightly together, the outer edge of the collar is forced into a groove 7, as shown in Fig. 2.

Feb. 4, [date appliedfor under Patents Act, 1901]. Armatures.-Relates to windings for direct-current generators whereby one terminal is kept at a constant potential between the potentials of the main terminals. The invention is described with regard to machines for three-wire distribution, in which case the auxiliary winding has half as many turns as the main winding ; but two such machines may be employed in a five-wire system. Figs. 3, 5, and 6 show bipolar armatures carrying, in addition to the ordinary ring winding 12, an auxiliary winding 13 for keeping the slip-ring 6 at potential midway between the potentials of the brushes 4, the two windings being connected at the point 14. In Fig. 3, the sixteen maio conductors in the upper half of the armature are shown accompanied by eight auxiliary conductors 13, the two being wound in the same slots so as to be influenced by the same field strength throughout. Fig. 5 shows the same form but with one half of the auxiliary conductors wound 180 electrical degrees forward and in the reverse direction to correct the effect due to the two halves being under poles of opposite sign. The preferred arrangement is shown in Fig. 6, where the auxiliary conductor are statically balanced around the armature and still maintain the ring 6 at the required intermediate potential. This arrangement also minimizes the magnetic distortion by currents in the mid-wire 9. Fig. 7 shows a form having windings 13, 16 corresponding respectively to those of Figs. 3 and 5 for giving a very uniform distribution of the auxiliary conductors among the main turns 12. With two auxiliary windings, the tapping- points 14, 17 are preferably 90 electrical degrees apart, as shown, and with three or six windings they are 120 and 60 degrees apart; but these angular spacings are not essential provided that each set of auxiliary conductors is so arranged as to correspond completely with one of the circuits of the main winding. Although it is preferable for the main and auxiliary windings to correspond in phase position as shown, slight asymmetry may be allowed, the numbers of turns being altered to compensate this. Fig. 8 shows a four-fold parallel-wound drum armature with two auxiliary windings 18, 20 connected to diametrically opposed commutator segments by equipotential connectors 19, 21 and both feeding the slip-ring 6. The four conductors 18<a>, 18<b>, 18<c>, 18<d> correspond in phase respectively to the pairs of main conductors 3, 10 ; 5, 12 ; 7. 14 ; and 1, 8 ; and thus keep the slip-ring potential midway between the potentials of the conductors 1, 14 ; that is midway between the main brush potentials. Owing to the cross connexion 19, the auxiliary winding also corresponds in phase to the main conductors in the circuits starting from the bars 17, 22 and terminating through the bars 32, 9 at the other brushes. The winding 20 similarly corresponds to all the conductors in the main winding, and any number of further auxiliary windings may be similarly connected between the main windings and the slip-ring. The auxiliary conductors are preferably placed at the bottoms of the slots which contain the main winding. By using two or more such machines in series, a multiple-wire system may be obtained across the sections of which, for example, the armatures and fields of motors may be connected to obtain large speed ranges in the usual way.",BURKE JAMES,BURKE JAMES,,https://lens.org/060-039-666-383-760,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Brush-holders.- Relates to a construction of brushholder for dynamoelectric machines, by which the pressure of the brush on the commutator may be readily adjusted. The brushholders 5, Figs. 1 and 2, which are preferably stamped and formed into a U-shape from sheet metal, are mounted on a threaded stud 1. A plate 2 is provided with ears 3, to which the stud 1 is fixed by screws 4. The brushes 6, which are preferably formed with bevelled sides overlapping each other as shown in Fig. 1, are secured to the holders by screws 8 and nuts 8<1>. The arms of the holders have each a rounded corner 5<1>, which clears the support 2, and a square corner 5"" adapted to engage the support when the holder is turned back. Spiral springs 11 are fixed at one end to the plate 2 and at the other end to an insulating-sleeve 10, which surrounds a pin 10<1> adapted to engage in notches 9. The brush pressure is regulated by varying the position of the pin 10<1> in the notches 9. The brushes 6 may be at right-angles to the supports as in Fig. 2, or inclined thereto as shown in Fig. 4, in which the circle 12 represents the commutator, the plates 2 being insulated from the parts 13, which extend from the end bracket of the machine, by sheets 16 and suitable insulating-bushings. In cases where a brush yoke or supporting-ring is used, the stud 1 forms the main support for all the parts, and passes through an opening in the brush yoke 17, Fig. 5, from which it is insulated by a suitable bushing 18. A terminal plate 21 may be inserted between the nut 19 and washer 20, which hold the stud 1 securely in position. Where the stud 1 is not threaded, flexible conductors may connect the brushes or support to the stud 1 or plate 2.",BURKE JAMES,BURKE JAMES,,https://lens.org/169-995-624-687-806,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Burke, J. Sept. 2. Electric locomotives and motor vehicles.-To enable electric motors (especially large motors for electric railway cars &c.) to be started without causing a rush of current to the armature, and with a relatively large torque, a combination of a shunt motor and a series motor is employed, in which the two armatures are mounted on a common shaft or on separate shafts coupled together. At starting, the two armatures a and b and the series winding d are connected together in series, while the shunt winding c is preferably connected directly across the mains; a starting and regulating resistance f and a variable shunt resistance k are connected in circuit, as shown. As the speed increases, the armature a exercises a braking effect on the armature b ; this is gradually reduced by increasing the resistance k, until finally this resistance is cut out. The speed is further increased by cutting out the resistance f. In the next place, a variable resistance is inserted between the line and the shunt winding c, and the armature a is short circuited. Further increases of speed are obtained by connecting the motors in parallel, a resistance being first arranged in circuit with the armature a, then a resistance in shunt to the field winding d, and finally a resistance in series with the field winding c. During stopping, the armature a of the shunt motor acts as a magnetic brake.",BURKE JAMES,BURKE JAMES,,https://lens.org/025-000-074-917-012,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The outer end of the valve stem also has a plurality of heat-sensing arms extending radially and then axially from the end of the stem in spaced relation thereto, said arms being engaged with the top of the mounting cup. A connector ring joins the ends of the arms where they engage the cup. The other end portion of the valve stem carries a compression spring which is engaged with the rigid washer in the cup and also with an abutment on the stem. The spring applies pressure to the washer, which in turn presses the sealing gasket against the underside of the top wall of the cup. Spring pressure is thus exerted through the stem on the heat-responsive arms, and maintains these in engagement with the top surface of the cup. Under conditions of excessive heat, the arms weaken and yield, being aided by the action of the coil spring, and the latter thereupon shifts the valve stem to move the side orifices thereof completely through the sealing gasket whereby they communicate with the interior of the container to enable discharge of the pressurized liquid therein through the bore of the stem.",VCA CORP,BURKE JAMES E,PITTWAY CORPORATION (1981-08-24),https://lens.org/118-907-606-653-028,Granted Patent,yes,2,7,1,1,0,A62C13/64;;A62C35/10;;A62C13/64;;A62C35/10,A62C13/64;;A62C35/10,169/26,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A vehicle having an internal combustion engine, a cranking motor, and a battery includes a double-layer capacitor characterized by a capacitance greater than 150 farads, and a low internal resistance. First and second electrical paths interconnect the capacitor with the cranking motor. A control circuit is coupled between the positive and negative terminals of the capacitor, and this control circuit includes a switch that applies a variable control voltage to a relay in response to the position of the switch. The relay is included in one of the electrical paths, and the relay isolates the capacitor from the cranking motor when switched to the open-circuit condition by the control voltage and enables the capacitor to supply cranking current to the cranking motor when the control voltage places the relay in the closed-circuit condition.

The cylindrical sleeve (70) is preferably made of radiation-blocking material, so that the cooling-oil body (50) is screened against X-rays (42). A window (76) is located on a line with the housing window (52), so that an X-ray bundle can leave the arrangement. A radiation-blocking screen (84) is mounted between the cathode and one end of the tube in order to block off radiation which is emitted in this direction. The anode prevents the radiation from leaving in the other direction. An additional cylinder made of radiation-blocking material (86) can optionally be mounted between the cathode and the cylindrical sleeve (70). <IMAGE>",PICKER INT INC,BURKE JAMES E,"PHILIPS MEDICAL SYSTEMS (CLEVELAND), INC., CLEVELA (2004-03-25)",https://lens.org/174-811-899-753-042,Patent Application,no,0,2,3,3,0,H01J35/02;;H01J35/02;;H01J35/066;;H01J35/066;;H01J35/10;;H01J35/10;;H01J35/147;;H01J35/147;;H01J35/165;;H01J35/165;;H01J35/24;;H01J35/24;;H01J35/26;;H01J35/26;;H01J2235/162;;H01J2235/162;;H05G1/025;;H05G1/025;;H05G1/04;;H05G1/04;;H05G1/06;;H05G1/06;;H05G1/08;;H05G1/08;;H05G1/20;;H05G1/20;;H05G1/34;;H05G1/34;;H05G1/52;;H05G1/52;;H05G1/66;;H05G1/66,H01J35/02;;H01J35/06;;H01J35/10;;H01J35/14;;H01J35/16;;H01J35/24;;H01J35/26;;H05G1/04;;H05G1/06;;H05G1/08;;H05G1/20;;H05G1/34;;H05G1/52;;H05G1/66,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

If the measured plant temperature is greater than the setpoint temperature, and humidity is not restrictive to plant cooling, then irrigation can be triggered to retain the plant within the desired stressed level, as determined by the temperature of the plant. By this method, irrigation can be withheld to increase plant temperature or applied to reduce plant temperature.

   An insulating material and the method of applying the insulating material to products and systems. The material, method and system may be applied to tubulars used in deep water projects. The insulating material is composed of ceramic particles, epoxy and an acrylate monomer that is a precurser to an acrylic resin, and additives. Equal volumes of a epoxy component mixtures and a curing agent component mixture when heated and mixed together create a liquid insulating material that can be applied to the outer surface of pipe involving a repetitive series of steps controlled by an operator at a main control panel. Pipe unrolled from a pipe reel is straightened and heated. In a heated retort, liquid insulating material is applied to the surface of pipe and cured to the final insulation coating. The final coated pipe can be replaced on the reel for shipment to the job site. Within the deep sea environment the hardness of the insulating material can withstand the compressive pressure, water absorption and corrosion; and the insulating properties avoid the affects of near-freezing water temperatures. A curing agent in the formulation provides flexibility to the insulation. In the underwater environment, current movements can damage and breech the connections of the systems. Flexibility in the insulation will protect the systems from the currents and ensure integrity of the systems especially critical in piping systems.

   A harvester with a control system responsive to at least one crop processing variable for automatically controlling forward speed of the harvester includes a crop presence responsive switch connected to an automatic harvester control system. The switch, preferably a proximity switch responsive to movement of the feeder house drum from an empty feeder house limit position, provides a signal in response to crop entering the feeder house for initiating the automatic speed control of the harvester after the header receives the crop and prior to the crop entering the processing structure. The automatic control initiation structure is particularly useful with an automatic combine throughput control and eliminates unstable operation resulting from delayed control initiation. The switch is part of an adjustable down stop mechanism for the feeder house drum.

Mitchell, W. R., and Vigo, J. B. Feb. 12. Soldering.-In making solders for aluminium, copper, and other bodies, the zinc which is used is purified by melting and stirring in about 1 oz. of potassium chlorate to 11 lb. of zinc, the scum being removed. The lead and tin used are similarly treated, somewhat less chlorate being used in the case of the lead. A hard brittle solder, designated Grade A, is made by heating 2 oz. aluminium to a white heat in one crucible, and in another melting together 7 oz. of the prepared zinc, 2 oz. tin chloride, and 2 oz. zinc cblcride, and stirring vigorously. The contents of the two crucibles are then mixed and thoroughly incorporated by stirring. The resulting mass after cooling is heated to a dull red heat with 2 oz. tin chloride and 2 oz. zinc chloride, the mixture being stirred vigorously until a homogeneous mass is produced, which is then poured into moulds and is ready for use. A softer, more easily fusible. solder is made by melting in one crucible 7 oz. of Grade A solder with 1 oz. tin chloride and 1 oz. zinc chloride, and in another crucible 2 oz. tin, 1 oz. lead, 1 oz. tin chloride, and 1 oz. zinc chloride, the contents of the crucibles being then thoroughly mixed. Another solder is made by melting in one crucible 7 oz. of Grade A solder, 1 oz. tin chloride, and 1 oz. zinc chloride, and in another crucible 2 oz. cadmium, 1 oz. lead 1 oz. tin, 1 oz. zinc chloride, and 1 oz. tin chloride, the contents of the crucibles being afterwards thoroughly mixed.",MITCHELL WILLIAM ROY;;VIGO JAMES BURKE,MITCHELL WILLIAM ROY;;VIGO JAMES BURKE,,https://lens.org/067-591-337-912-346,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   A system and process are disclosed for automatically resuming data communication using an IEEE-1394 PHY when communication is suspended because input bias is momentarily lost. The PHY determines whether data communication is suspended due to the PHY being disconnected from a network by checking the status of a connected flag. If the connected flag is still set to TRUE, the PHY was not intentionally disconnected from the network and it automatically attempts to resume communication by setting a resume flag to TRUE. The invention finds application in any type of communication device using the IEEE-1394 high-speed serial bus standard including audio and video sources, which may readily be connected to a personal computer for data storage or editing. The system and process may be implemented using software code and included within a digital signal processor (DSP).

    A harvester with a control system responsive to at least one crop processing variable for automatically controlling forward speed of the harvester includes a crop presence responsive switch connected to an automatic harvester control system. The switch, preferably a proximity switch responsive to movement of the feeder house drum from an empty feeder house limit position, provides a signal in response to crop entering the feeder house for initiating the automatic speed control of the harvester after the header receives the crop and prior to the crop entering the processing structure. The automatic control initiation structure is particularly useful with an automatic combine throughput control and eliminates unstable operation resulting from delayed control initiation. The switch is part of an adjustable down stop mechanism for the feeder house drum.

The temperature of the target plant is repeatedly measured over a period of interest, and after each measurement, the plant temperature is compared with a predetermined plant setpoint temperature associated with a desired water-deficit stress level, above which temperature the plant is deemed to be in an undesired metabolic state. If the measured plant temperature is greater than the setpoint temperature, and humidity is not restrictive to plant cooling, then irrigation can be triggered to retain the plant within the desired stressed level, as determined by the temperature of the plant. By this method, irrigation can be withheld to increase plant temperature or applied to reduce plant temperature.

   The system for detecting the edge of a moving data storage medium measures the ambient noise level of the magneto-resistive read head when the magneto-resistive read head is completely off the magnetic tape media. The system for detecting the edge of a moving data storage medium sets a signal threshold that is a predetermined increase over the magneto-resistive read head output signal generated by the ambient noise. The system for detecting the edge of a moving data storage medium then moves the magneto-resistive read head on to the magnetic tape media, where an increase in the magneto-resistive read head output signal is generated due to the friction of the moving magnetic tape coming into contact with the magneto-resistive read head, causing an increased noise level. The resultant increase in the magneto-resistive read head output signal, when it exceeds the signal threshold, is indicative of the presence of the edge of the magnetic tape and can be used as an accurate measure of the edge of the magnetic tape.

    Polymers are randomly labelled with labelling groups such as fluorophores, by a process of creating free radicals on the polymer in the presence of a stable free radical, such as an aminooxyl compound, so that the stable free radical group bonds to the polymer in random fashion. Labelling groups such as fluorophores are attached to the stable free radical groups, before or after they are attached to the polymer. The process allows labelling of polymers having no reactive functional groups, it can also be applied to the labelling of nucleic acids, for use in conjunction with a PCR chain extension sequencing process, to allow the sequencing of target nucleic acids of high molecular weight.

The temperature of the target plant is repeatedly measured over a period of interest, and after each measurement, the plant temperature is compared with a predetermined plant setpoint temperature associated with a desired water-deficit stress level, above which temperature the plant is deemed to be in an undesired metabolic state. If the measured plant temperature is greater than the setpoint temperature, and humidity is not restrictive to plant cooling, then irrigation can be triggered to retain the plant within the desired stressed level, as determined by the temperature of the plant. By this method, irrigation can be withheld to increase plant temperature or applied to reduce plant temperature.

    The system for detecting the edge of a moving data storage medium measures the ambient noise level of the magneto-resistive read head when the magneto-resistive read head is completely off the magnetic tape media. The system for detecting the edge of a moving data storage medium sets a signal threshold that is a predetermined increase over the magneto-resistive read head output signal generated by the ambient noise. The system for detecting the edge of a moving data storage medium then moves the magneto-resistive read head on to the magnetic tape media, where an increase in the magneto-resistive read head output signal is generated due to the friction of the moving magnetic tape coming into contact with the magneto-resistive read head, causing an increased noise level. The resultant increase in the magneto-resistive read head output signal, when it exceeds the signal threshold, is indicative of the presence of the edge of the magnetic tape and can be used as an accurate measure of the edge of the magnetic tape.

As the hood opens the closing spring force goes to zero and, as the hood moves to the open position, the opening spring is engaged by the mechanism to dampen the motion of the hood, ultimately stops the hood by interference of the spring coils, and counterbalances the hood weight in the open position to assist closing.
