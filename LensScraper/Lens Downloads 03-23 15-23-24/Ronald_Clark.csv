The present invention provides a pair of levers suitably configured and positioned within a fastener to provide an amplified indication of the deformation of the fastener as a load is applied to the fastener. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a first lever is connected at an internal pivot point of a cartridge with the lower end of the first lever resting upon an abutment within the fastener, while the upper end displaces the lower end of a second lever such that movement of the upper end of the second lever is amplified with respect to movement of the lower end of the first lever. As the fastener is tightened, the fastener will elongate causing the abutment to move away from the lower end of the first lever. As the abutment moves, the first lever pivots or rotates causing the upper end or indicator of the second lever to move relative to a visual scale that is calibrated to indicate clamping force. The cartridge carrying the two levers is inserted into the fastener with the lower end of the first lever being displaced by the abutment a distance corresponding to a preselected elongation of the fastener, placing the indicator end of the second lever at the lower vales of the indicator scale. As the fastener is tightened, elongation of the fastener causes displacement of the abutment and a movement of the indicator up the indicator scale. If the fastener loses tension, the fastener will contract and the abutment will again displace the lower end of the first lever, rotating the indicator end of the second lever toward the lower values of the indicator scale. Assembly and calibration of the device requires the simple, inexpensive process of advancing the cartridge within a central bore in the fastener.",CLARK RONALD C,CLARK RONALD C,VALLEY FORGE & BOLT MFG.

    The present invention is a system for providing GPS users with a high level of confidence in the integrity and accuracy of received GPS signals. A first GPS satellite broadcasts a GPS navigation message to GPS users in view of the satellite. The first GPS satellite also sends a copy of the GPS navigation message to a second GPS satellite via an RF or optical crosslink. The second GPS satellite then determines the position and time of the first GPS satellite relative to the second GPS satellite based on the contents of the received GPS navigation message. The second GPS satellite compares this relative position and time to satellite position and time data stored in the second GPS satellite, such as ephemeris/almanac data received from a ground station or Autonav data. The second GPS satellite thereby checks whether the GPS navigation message received from the first GPS satellite has integrity. The second GPS satellite then sends an integrity message back to the first GPS satellite via a crosslink. The first GPS satellite transmits an integrity message to all in view GPS receivers. The GPS receivers can then determine whether or not the GPS signals being received have integrity. If the integrity message contains correction data, the GPS receivers can use the correction data to correct the GPS signals. The GPS users will thus be provided with very high confidence in the integrity, accuracy, and reliability of the GPS position and time data.

    The present invention is a system for providing GPS users with a high level of confidence in the integrity and accuracy of received GPS signals. A beacon is located at a fixed point on the earth at a known location. The beacon emits a coded signal pulse having a precise RF waveform that is received by all GPS satellites in view of the beacon's location. The RF signal pulse is decoded and processed onboard each GPS satellite. The GPS satellite receives beacon position data from the other in-view GPS satellites via crosslinks. The GPS satellite compares the beacon position data with satellite position data such as Autonav data and thereby verifies the integrity of its own operation. The GPS satellite then sends an integrity message to GPS users to inform the GPS users of the integrity of received GPS signals from that satellite.

    The present invention is a system for providing GPS users with a high level of confidence in the integrity and accuracy of received GPS signals. The system provides a means for each GPS satellite itself to verify the accuracy and/or integrity of its own operations by calculations and processing internal to the GPS satellite and by crosslink communications with other GPS satellites in the GPS constellation. After a GPS satellite verifies the accuracy and/or integrity of its own signals, the GPS satellite transmits an integrity message to all GPS users in view of the satellite. The integrity message can alert GPS users to a loss of integrity or accuracy in the GPS signals. Alternatively, the integrity message can contain information to correct errors in the GPS signals. The integrity message can be incorporated into the existing GPS navigation message transmitted by GPS satellites, or the integrity message can be transmitted over a separate channel such as the planned L  5  band channel.

    The present invention is a system for providing GPS users with a high level of confidence in the integrity and accuracy of received GPS signals. A waveform monitor allows the GPS satellite to verify the integrity of its transmitted signal by detecting its own transmitted waveform. The waveform monitor includes a receiver mounted in the GPS satellite. The receiver receives the GPS signal transmitted by the GPS satellite. The waveform monitor then compares the received GPS signal with a copy of what the GPS satellite intended to send which is stored in memory. The waveform monitor can compare the received digital navigation message with the copy stored in memory, and/or compare the received RF waveform with waveform data stored in memory. The waveform monitor thereby determines whether the transmitted signal has integrity. The GPS satellite then sends an integrity message to GPS users to inform the GPS users of the integrity of received GPS signals from that satellite.

SIEMENS BROS. & CO., Ltd. Dec. 3, 1954 [Dec. 24, 1953], No. 35860/53. Class 40 (4). In a circuit arrangement for coupling a telephone line to a piece of apparatus, such as a recorder, access is had from a final selector or from a group selector to a control circuit, the outgoing side of which is connected to the apparatus, the application of the exchange battery to the incoming wires of the control circuit causing an indication that the apparatus has been taken into use to be given; and on the release of the apparatus the reversal of the battery connections to the control circuit causes the giving of an indication that the use of the apparatus has ended. Access from final selector, Fig. 1. The wires from the final selector bank F/S are also connected to the line wires of a line circuit LC associated with the control circuit, a cross-over being inserted as shown. In response to dialled digits from a caller (not shown) the final selector seizes the control circuit shown and applies ringing current thereto. Relay R pulls up and bridges the incoming wires to operate the ring-trip relay in the final selector. Coupling relay D operates to the battery feed then extended by the final selector, disconnects R and its own winding (I) from the line and connects up its winding (II) and uncoupling relay CS which also operates. The line is thus extended to wires 1 and 2 leading to the recording apparatus (not shown) and lamp ENG lights in a local circuit over wires 5 and 8. When the caller clears, the guarding earth is removed from the test wire in the final selector and the line relay in the associated line circuit LC is connected up in known manner to the wires incoming to the control circuit. With the battery reversed, CS releases and immediately re-operates, but D, which obtains its armature during the reversal, is released. Lamp ENG is extinguished and a circuit is completed for lamp CL and buzzer BZ over wires 5 and 8. Relay CS may then be released by an attendant by operation of key RL. If automatic restoration of CS were desired, contacts cs1 cs2 would not be wired up. The recorder may be taken out of use by throwing key BK which connects up a permanent loop. Access from group selector, Figs. 2, 3. The group selector bank contacts are wired to a relay set (Fig. 2) including a feed bridge which in the idle condition applies resistance battery to the p-wire. Relay A pulls up to the seizing loop and B follows, thus changing over the battery connections to the control circuit (Fig. 3). Relay D operates and removes the short-circuit from the left-hand winding of CS which then operates in series with D; lamp ENG is lit. When the caller clears, A falls away and is followed by B and D; CS being held over its right-hand winding. To obtain automatic release of CS, the strap shown in the circuit of contacts cs1 would be omitted. An attendant may speak to users of either embodiment by operating the speak key SP to connect up her telephone set over wires T1.",SIEMENS BROTHERS & CO LTD,CLARK RONALD ISAAC HERBERT,,https://lens.org/001-461-203-818-856,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H04M11/10,H04M11/10,H4K KQG           KQG;;H4K K1A2          KQG;;H4K K22A          K22,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

SIEMENS BROS., & CO., Ltd. Jan. 14, 1955 [Jan. 22, 1954], No. 2042/54. Class 40 (4). A bidirectional final selector which has certain levels allocated to party lines and others to individual lines and which has an auxiliary switch DS for choosing a ringing code is arranged always to receive three digits. In the case of a call to a party line the first and third digits set the selector and the second controls DS, whereas in the case of a call to an individual line the first digit is absorbed and the selector is set by the second and third digits. When the selector is raised by the first digit to a party line level, after the relapse of dialling relay C a circuit is made over vertical bank VBA and wire DLB for relay RL which connects up magnet DSM in place of vertical magnet V. At the end of the second digit, RL releases and connects up the normal change-over relay RD to direct the final digit to rotary magnet R. If the wanted line is free, test and switching relay H operates and code ringing takes place under the control of relay CR in accordance with the setting of the switch DS. If a party line serves 11 to 20 subscribers it is connected in two levels, and when the selector is raised to one of them a circuit is made over a second vertical bank VBB and wire DLC for advancing the switch DS to a subnormal position before it is stepped by the second digit. Alternatively, a different wiper of DS could be selected. When the selector is raised by the first digit to a level accommodating individual lines, a circuit is made over vertical bank VBA and wire DLA for relay OL which connects up release magnet Z. The wipers drop back and the selector responds to the subsequent digits in the usual manner. Provision is made for PBX hunting under the control of relay HS and wipers PB1, PB2, as described in Specification 203,759, [Class 40 (iv)]. If a PBX group occupies more than one level, the wipers are restored rotarily by magnet RZ on reaching the end of the level and are stepped upwardly to continue the search in the next level.",SIEMENS BROTHERS & CO LTD,CLARK RONALD ISAAC HERBERT,,https://lens.org/169-230-314-712-506,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,H04Q3/00;;H04Q3/00,H04Q3/00,H4K KPA           KQA;;H4K K1A2          KQA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The process is notably “non-Fischer-Tropsch” meaning that it does not require oxygen to be admitted into the reactor for supplying thermal energy by partial combustion, which is normally required to split methane. This freedom from high temperature operation and the other demands of an oxygenation process means that higher carbon efficiency is achievable This is made possible with mechanochemistry and “sonic catalysis” that employ kinetic energy to promote the breakdown of methane molecules, the reformation of the resulting carbon-hydrogen fragments, and the rejuvenation of the catalyst surface. A number of liquid fuels can be produced which are easily transported and fully marketable without further processing. Within the range of output products is a liquid solvent which can be used as a substitute “fracking” fluid, which is recoverable as recycled feedstock for further conversion—thus eliminating the problem of water treatment.

The process is accomplished with inexpensive procedures common in materials research laboratories, i.e., electron beam deposition and sputtering. The procedures are conducive to treating foil gage titanium and result in submicron layers which virtually add no weight to the titanium. The ultra-thin coatings diffusion bond with the substrate titanium without costly heating steps and the coatings blend with the substrate titanium until separate mechanical properties are subsumed by those of the substrate without cracking or spallation.

Gas producer:; gas compositions. IMPERIAL CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES, Ltd. Sept. 25, 1952 [Nov. 2, 1951], No. 25656/51. Classes 55 (1) and 55 (2) In a process for the continuous production from particulate coal of a synthesis gas containing large proportions of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, the coal is injected by a gas such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen through a line 4 into a carbonization and gasification vessel 1, steam being admitted at 5 at sufficient velocity to form a fluidized or boiling bed. The bed is maintained at a temperature of 850‹ to 1050‹ C. by withdrawing char through line 11 and passing it in a gas stream admitted at 12 into a vessel 2 where it is entrained in an upflowing stream of preheated air entering at 8. The char is partly burnt and the remainder, which is highly heated, separates from the blow gas in vessel 3 and returns to vessel 1 through a pipe 6. The product gas is withdrawn at 7 whilst the blow gas passes to a waste heat boiler 13. The coal feed line 4 enters the vessel 1 at a point remote from the char inlet from pipe 6 so that carbonization gases are subjected to cracking in contact with the char before they reach the outlet pipe 7. The synthesis gas produced contains in percentages by volume CO 2 10-20, CO 20-35, H, 30-65, CH, 0-3, the remainder being nitrogen.

SIEMENS BROS. & CO., Ltd. Jan. 13, 1950 [Jan. 14, 1949], No. 1105/49. Class 40 (iv). An unanswered incoming call to a substation comprising main and extension telephones gives a calling signal at one telephone for a certain period and then at the other telephone for a further period, the two periods being measured by the substation's impulse sender which is of the kind wherein the operation of a single key determines the transmission of all the digits of a multi-digit number.' A subscriber at a substation of this type at a P.A.B.X. is enabled to route an outgoing call to the main exchange by the operation of a single key and to complete the connection by means of a further key corresponding to the wanted number, all the digits of this number being sent before it is necessary for the caller to lift his receiver. As shown, the exchange line is connected to terminals LX, the main telephone to terminals LM, and the extension telephone to terminals LE. In this Abridgment the users of the main and extension telephones will be referred to as "" main "" and "" extension "" respectively. The impulse sender operates as described in Specification 646,439. P.A.B.X. with dialling-out facility. Main first operates a "" send "" key SK corresponding to the digits required to route the call to the main exchange, the marking terminal ZA, ..., ZG following those signifying the main exchange being connected to terminal OST. Then on the release of relay K at the beginning of the corresponding digit period, relay OS operates and brings up relay T, which releases all other relays and connects the exchange line to a loudspeaker MLS in which main hears dialling tone whereupon he operates a second "" send "" key SK corresponding to the wanted number. Incoming call. Ringing current rings main's bell CBM and energizes winding (i) of relay RR which operates and holds on its winding (ii), bringing up relays RC, K to start an impulsing sequence. If main answers, the ringing stops and the opening of switch-hook contact MSA releases relays RR, RC, K and any operated relays in the impulse sender. If main fails to answer, then on the release of relay K at the end of the 7th "" pause "" period, relay H being energized, relay CE operates on its winding (i) and holds on (ii), releasing all operated relays in the impulse sender and bringing up relay EX to disconnect main's bell CBM. Relay SW operates on its winding (i) and holds on (ii), lighting an indicator lamp LEL for main, while relay RC releases slowly to bring up relay K and start a further impulsing sequence. Contact p2 sends impulses to relay RE which repeatedly reverses the polarity of the wires of the extension telephone, causing distinctive ringing at the extension. If main answers at this time, switch-hook contact MSA releases CE and all other operated relays and main is in conversational connection with the caller. If, however, extension answers, switch-hook contact ESH is closed to hold EX and bring up relay SH which releases RR, CE and all other operated relays except SW and EX. Extension is now connected to the caller. Should the call remain unanswered, resetting relay CO returns the apparatus to normal at the end of the 7th ""pause"" period. If ringing current is still being applied, the sequence of operations starts again. Transfer of calls. By closing a key SCE so that relay EX is permanently energized, main can direct all incoming calls to extension who may offer a call to main by closing a key OK. This operates relays RR, SP, CO to hold the exchange line while completing a local conversational circuit for main and extension. Relay SH releases slowly, followed by CO, and meanwhile relay BZ by self-interruption produces a signal in main's loud-speaker MLS. When main lifts his receiver, extension can transfer the call to him by releasing key OK and momentarily operating a key SWK to release relays RR, SP, SW. Main may give the exchange line to extension, whom he first calls as described below. When extension lifts his receiver, the brief operation of a key TRK by main or of a key ETK by extension brings up relays BZ, SW to switch the exchange line to extension who may return the circuit to its previous condition by operating key SWK or may offer a call to main as above. Local loudspeaking telephone system. This comprises main's loud-speaker MLS and transmitter MTR, and a receiver EXR and transmitter EXTR for the use of extension. Main calls extension by closing a switch LSW and a "" call "" key MCK. Relay M buzzes by selfinterruption in extension's receiver EXR which extension then lifts from its switch-hook having contacts LSHA, LSHB, so that relay ES operates to complete the local speech circuits and light a lamp SEL. Extension calls main by operating his "" call "" key EXCK, whereupon relay M buzzes in loud-speaker MLS, and then lifting his receiver EXR. Main responds by closing switch LSW and relay ES completes the connection as before.",SIEMENS BROTHERS & CO LTD,HUMPHRIES HORACE EDGAR;;CLARK RONALD ISAAC HERBERT,,https://lens.org/178-046-639-928-192,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H04M1/715,H04M1/715,H4K KFB           KFB;;H4K K1A2          KFB,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

PLESSEY CO. Ltd. 9 June, 1967 [15 June, 1966; 1 March, 1967], Nos. 26666/66 and 9772/67. Heading B6J. [Also in Division H1] Different metals in a multi-layer structure are etched by applying a positive working photo-resist to the outer layer of metal; exposing a first pattern and developing to remove the exposed resist; exposing a second pattern in the remaining resist; etching the outer layer of metal under the exposed first pattern; and then at some stage after this first etching step, developing the second pattern is permit the outer layer of metal under the exposed second pattern to be etched. In an example, successive layers (5, 6, 7) (Fig. 3, not shown) of aluminium nickel and aluminium are deposited on a glass substrate 4 and covered with a positiveworking photo-resist (8). The resist is exposed and developed to leave unexposed resist over areas 1, 2 and 3, Fig. 2, and then a second pattern is formed by exposing resist over area 3 only. The exposed aluminium is etched away with an ammonium persulphate/orthophosphoric acid mixture and then the second pattern is developed (Fig. 6, not shown).

Automatic exchange systems. BRITISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH Ltd. April 24, 1959 [May 12, 1958], No. 15203/58. Class 40 (4). The difference between metering pulses of one duration and a calling line identification signal of another duration is detected by a magnetic drum register which tests for the signal periodically and keeps a score of the number of successive tests which indicate the signal present or absent, the score for signal present not being abandoned unless the score for signal absent exceeds a given number. To be recorded a metering pulse must last for at least 6 counts and be spaced by at least three counts while calling line identification is initiated for a count of at least 16. A count of over 32 operates an alarm circuit. Interruptions of the signals giving rise to counts of less than 3 are ignored. The system to which the invention is applied is shown in Fig. 1 where a subscriber S seizes a trunk relay set TRS over line circuit LC and group selector GS whereupon a register-translator RD of magnetic drum type, over a scanner SC2, causes operation of contacts HV to revert a positive potential in demand for calling line identification. Detecting this potential over scanner SC1 a metering drum MD, which also carries subscriber's addresses, transfers the calling number and its class of service to RD by way of a buffer store BS. Register translator RD then stores the called subscriber's address, decides on the charging rate, and times the call. At the end of the call RD transfers to automatic accounting equipment AA calling and called parties addresses with call duration and meter charge. A control track of the metering drum MD is shown in Fig. 3 and comprises twelve storage elements synchronized with clock pulses TA1 to TA12. The gating circuits of Fig. 4 with bi-stable circuits MAN, MBN, govern the control track. Inputs SL, SL, indicate a 1 or a 0 read out, respectively, while SA and SB indicate a 0 or a 1 written respectively. Elements 1 and 2 form a counter b which with no signal, represented by input PAM, cycles idly. When a signal PAM is detected in the preceding period TA12 counter b is set to zero, a 1 is written in element 3 to mark the track busy and one is added to the counter a in elements 4 to 9. Should the signal PAM cease the counter b starts from zero but if the signal PAM reappears before b counts to 3 the counter a is not disturbed and continues to count during the interruption by virtue of the busy mark in element 3. If the signal PAM is absent long enough for counter b to reach 3 the element three is erased and the counter a is read out. If the count is between 6 and 15 in a, by time TA7 bi-stable circuit MAN has its upper output active and this will indicate a metering pulse. If the count in a is 16 to 31 bi-stable circuit MAN has its lower output active by time TA8 and this indicates a calling line identification signal. If the count has gone as far as 32 then MAN has its lower output active in time TA9 and this produces an alarm condition. So long as elements 8 and 9 are recording 0 and a count between 6 and 15 occurs, 1 is written in element 10 or, if it already carries 1, this is erased and 1 is written in element 11. The record on elements 10 and 11 causes the addition of one or two units to the drum track registering the meter count which registration may be by means of a binary count or by a binary count over initial elements followed by elements having equal values.",BRITISH TELECOMM RES LTD,CLARK THOMAS HAROLD;;ROBINS JOHN MONTGOMERY;;GREER RONALD,,https://lens.org/104-586-781-296-192,Granted Patent,no,0,1,4,7,0,H04M15/04;;H04M15/06,H04M15/04;;H04M15/06,H4K KLC           KLC;;H4K K1A6          KLC;;H4K K1L           KLC,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

SOLUTION: When there is operation under execution, concerning this process, an OS 14 executes an event scan function and starts the function set to a firmware 16 by calling it, and the firmware 16 judges whether an investigation pulse cycle interval is reached or not. When this investigation pulse interval is reached, the firmware 16 generates an investigation/'heartbeat' signal to an (SP) 22. Afterwards, the (SP) 22 returns all discovered errors to the firmware 16 so as to check them so that the 'heartbeat' signal can be outputted at a required frequency.

Delivering measured quantities of liquids. BAIRD & TATLOCK (LONDON) Ltd. May 6, 1958 [May 6, 1957], No. 14415/57. Class 106(5). A liquid-dispensing apparatus capable of dispensing accurately predetermined quantities successively into a plurality of containers consists of at least one unit comprising a liquidmeasuring chamber 16, Fig. 2, communicating, through passages in a valve block 2, with inlet and outlet valves 12 and 13 mounted on faces 6, 7 of the block 2 with an inlet 9 connecting the face 6 to a reservoir of liquid under pressure and an outlet 11 connected to the face 7 through which the predetermined quantity is expelled from the chamber 16 in which measuring is effected, e.g. by the rise of a piston 18. An apertured cup-shaped support 14 holds the lower end of the chamber 16 when it is made of glass, but the support is formed integrally if the chamber is of metal; it is secured in a recess 3 in the valve block 2, the recess communicating with a passage 4 which leads into a transverse passage 5 between valve-controlled ports in the faces 6 and 7 of the block. The valves may be electromagnetically operated, of the type described in Specification 853,469, or they may be pneumatically or mechanically operated. When the predetermined quantity of liquid has passed into the chamber 16, the inlet valve 12 is de-energized and discharge may be effected at any subsequent time by energizing the outlet valve 13. Three similar dispensing units are shown mounted on a casing 21 which carries sets of guide wheels 22 and locating means 23 for a test-tube rack 24, Fig. 3, which comprises a metal frame 25 and a cover-plate 26 having three rows of test-tube-receiving holes spaced apart by distances equal to the spacing between the dispensing units. Guide strips 31 engage the guide wheels 22 and a further guide strip 32 is notched opposite each series of three test tube apertures 27, 28, 29 for engagement with rollers 34 and locating means 23. The upper end of each piston 18 may be arranged to close an adjustable contact 36 on a block 37 slidable on a guide rod 38. A switch included in the locating means 23 energizes the inlet valves 12 to allow liquid to flow from the reservoir until the ends 35 of the pistons 18 close the contacts 36 to effect closure of the inlet valves and the opening of the outlet valves 13. A pilot light 39 is connected in the outlet valve circuit to indicate the completion of a cycle of operations. A sealing collar may be provided in a recess in the top of the measuring chamber to reduce leakage; liquid may be supplied to this recess to prevent crystallisation of the thin film of liquid between the cylinder and piston. The Provisional Specification describes also the test-tube rack 24 as movable automatically through the apparatus.",BAIRD & TATLOCK LTD,MONK PHILIP REGINALD;;GREEN NORMAN CLARK;;HUTT RONALD,,https://lens.org/196-722-717-657-652,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,B01L3/0206;;B01L3/0206;;G01F11/32;;G01F11/32,B01L3/02;;G01F11/32,B8N NKB           KB+50X;;B8N N50X          KB+50X,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Therefore there are provided methods for choosing an appropriate allotype(s) of an immunoglobulin for the treatment or prevention of an infection in which a pathogen causes expression of a heterologous FcR. The appropriate Fc of the immunoglobulin chosen can then be engineered together with a suitable specificity (ligand) for pathogen, pathogen infected cell or the FcR encoded by the pathogen. In particular it is proposed selection, design, production and/or administration of immunoglobulins of allotypes which bind HSV-1 and other heterologous FcRs with modified affinity.",UNIV CAMBRIDGE TECH;;ATHERTON ASA;;ARMOUR KATHRYN LESLEY;;CLARK MICHAEL RONALD,ATHERTON ASA;;ARMOUR KATHRYN LESLEY;;CLARK MICHAEL RONALD,,https://lens.org/005-294-002-965-163,Patent Application,yes,1,3,3,3,0,A61K2039/505;;A61P31/22;;C07K16/00;;C07K2317/52;;C07K2319/00;;C07K2319/30,A61P31/22;;C07K16/00;;C12N15/13,,3,3,002-181-056-131-279;;026-907-042-803-266;;030-277-375-783-057,10.1074/jbc.274.11.6911;;10066744;;10219765;;10.1046/j.1365-3083.1999.00521.x;;10.1002/1521-4141(200009)30:9<2540::aid-immu2540>3.0.co;2-s;;10.1002/1521-4141(200009)30:9<2540::aid-immu2540>3.3.co;2-j;;11009087,"CHAPMAN TARA L ET AL: ""Characterization of the interaction between the herpes simplex virus type I Fc receptor and immunoglobulin G."", JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY, vol. 274, no. 11, 12 March 1999 (1999-03-12), pages 6911 - 6919, XP002157313, ISSN: 0021-9258;;OXELIUS V A: ""Preparation of IgG subclass allotypes from polyclonal IgG."", SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY, (1999 APR) 49 (4) 395-8., XP000978723;;ATHERTON A ET AL: ""The herpes simplex virus type 1 Fc receptor discriminates between IgG1 allotypes."", EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY, (2000 SEP) 30 (9) 2540-7., XP000978715",PENDING

Systems and methods for sensing angular motion using a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) gyroscope are described. These systems and methods may be useful for sensing angular motion in the presence of low-frequency noise, which may be noise below 1 KHz. In a system for sensing angularmotion, low-frequency noise may give rise to duty cycle jitter, which may affect the demodulation of the sense signal and cause errors in angular motion estimates. The systems and methods described herein address this problem by relying on double-edge phase detection technique that involves sensing when the rising and falling edges of the resonator signal deviate from their expected values in theidealized 50% duty cycle scenario. To prevent the formation of ripples in the double-edge phase detection that may otherwise affect the demodulation of the sense signal, a switch may be used. The switch may be maintained in a non-conductive state when a ripple is received.",ANALOG DEVICES INC,YAN JIEFENG;;CLARK WILLIAM A;;KAPUSTA JR RONALD A,,https://lens.org/113-320-112-658-844,Patent Application,no,3,0,5,5,0,G01C19/5712;;G01C19/5726;;G01C19/5726;;G01C19/5755,G01C19/5712,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

   A powder injection molding process for making hard to make parts having internal cavities and hard to make parts made by the process. Metal powders having a variety of shapes and sizes are mixed with binder to make a feedstock. The feedstock is molded into at least two raw molded parts which are then sintered to join the parts together to form the hard to make part. This process eliminates all secondary operations in parts having internal cavities where core withdrawal is not possible. In preferred embodiment two raw parts are joined together during the sintering step without adding any materials to assist the bonding. This methodology can be used to make assemblies that have complex internal cavities such as filter sections and wave-guide components that are a low cost critical solution for the communications industry.

Semicircular ring semi-bodies 12a, 12b which are made of 9cr-1Mo alloy steel are formed by cutting a ring forging body and each ring semi-body have a pair of edge parts 12a', 12b' respectively, and the edge parts are processed in particular, then a welding groove 12d is formed between a side of the ring semi-bodies. Ring semi-bodies 12a, 12b are fit around the area 10 of the rotor 11 and corresponding edge parts 12a', 12b' of the ring semi-bodies are welded at the groove 12d by a narrow level end gas metallic arc welding respectively. Then, an exchanging ring 12 is installed next to the area 10. A pin is inserted in a blind hole 13 by the welding.

These systems and methods may be useful for sensing angular motion in the presence of low-frequency noise, which may be noise below 1 KHz. In a system for sensing angular motion, low-frequency noise may give rise to duty cycle jitter, which may affect the demodulation of the sense signal and cause errors in angular motion estimates. The systems and methods described herein address this problem by relying on double-edge phase detection technique that involves sensing when the rising and falling edges of the resonator signal deviate from their expected values in the idealized 50% duty cycle scenario. To prevent the formation of ripples in the double-edge phase detection that may otherwise affect the demodulation of the sense signal, a switch may be used. The switch may be maintained in a non-conductive state when a ripple is received.",ANALOG DEVICES INC,YAN JIEFENG;;CLARK WILLIAM A;;KAPUSTA JR RONALD A,ANALOG DEVICES INC (2018-07-17),https://lens.org/093-064-553-066-437,Patent Application,yes,0,0,5,5,0,G01C19/5712;;G01C19/5726;;G01C19/5726;;G01C19/5755,G01C19/5726,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

    A system installed in an automobile or other vehicle includes a master pager receiver unit or acknowledgment pager receiver/transmitter which receives paging messages sent from a paging transmitter site. The master unit is also in wireless communication with a set of slave units installed in the vehicle which include electronic switches and are programmed to control relays or other in-vehicle devices upon receipt of appropriate commands from the in-vehicle master unit. The slave units may include transceivers which allow the master unit to receive acknowledgment signals indicating that its commands were followed. The paging transmitter in the master unit also allows transmission of an acknowledgment signal to the paging transmitter site. The system provides a method and apparatus for communicating with specific electrical and mechanical components in the vehicle in order to access, monitor, disable and/or enable certain functions, features, and accessories in the vehicle. Audio and/or visual warning devices can also be used to deliver messages to the owner/operator of the vehicle, such as manufacturer recall notices. When the slave unit hears a specific code it opens or closes a switch that is connected to a specific electrical circuit and thus disables and enables functions of the automobile that are associated with that electrical circuit. The main receiver and/or standalone receiver of the system may also contain wiring harnesses that can be used to wire the main receiver directly to the relays in the automobile. One application of the invention is to remotely activate an audio warning device prior to disabling the ability for the driver to start the automobile by disabling the starter motor.

These systems and methods may be useful for sensing angular motion in the presence of low-frequency noise, which may be noise below 1 KHz. In a system for sensing angular motion, low-frequency noise may give rise to duty cycle jitter, which may affect the demodulation of the sense signal and cause errors in angular motion estimates. The systems and methods described herein address this problem by relying on double-edge phase detection technique that involves sensing when the rising and falling edges of the resonator signal deviate from their expected values in the idealized 50% duty cycle scenario. To prevent the formation of ripples in the double-edge phase detection that may otherwise affect the demodulation of the sense signal, a switch may be used. The switch may be maintained in a non-conductive state when a ripple is received.",ANALOG DEVICES INC,YAN JIEFENG;;CLARK WILLIAM A;;KAPUSTA JR RONALD A,ANALOG DEVICES INC (2018-07-17),https://lens.org/011-795-122-877-750,Granted Patent,yes,86,0,5,5,0,G01C19/5712;;G01C19/5726;;G01C19/5726;;G01C19/5755,G01C19/5726;;G01C19/5755,,23,13,190-394-007-190-834;;045-269-825-585-651;;022-442-779-528-585;;146-454-939-958-766;;068-297-048-941-959;;187-651-812-251-616;;028-711-409-006-289;;008-798-460-654-088;;090-117-814-264-739;;049-260-317-113-951;;011-478-591-266-486;;100-391-244-037-122;;012-520-688-472-115,10.1007/s10470-009-9395-6;;10.1109/84.925732;;10.1109/memsys.1998.659829;;10.1109/84.870053;;10.1109/jssc.2015.2496360;;10.1088/0960-1317/21/4/045008;;10.1109/tcst.2003.809240;;10.1109/ultsym.1995.495626;;10.1109/tmech.2005.852437;;10.3390/mi6121466;;10.1109/memsys.1997.581909;;10.1063/1.4792396;;23464244;;10.1016/j.proche.2009.07.206,"Great Britain Combined Search and Examination Report dated Oct. 12, 2016 in connection with Great Britain Application No. GB1604932.2.;;International Search Report and Written Opinion Application dated Jul. 28, 2016 in connection with International Application No. PCT/US2016/026385.;;International Preliminary Report on Patentability dated Oct. 19, 2017 in connection with International Application No. PCT/US2016/026385.;;[No Author Listed], ADXC1500, Combined gyroscope and dual-axis accelerometer.

Materials containing heavy hydrocarbons (i.e. oil sands or roofing shingles) are broken up into an auger and then mixed with light hydrocarbons. Subsequently, the resulting slurry is shaken to separate fluids from solids, and the fluids are subjected to one or more filtering processes to remove waste sediment. These filtering processes may include a series of one or more of centrifuges and nozzle purifier machines. Filtered fluids are distilled to separate heavy hydrocarbons from light hydrocarbons. Simultaneously, the solids are heated to remove the remaining light hydrocarbons as vapors. Light hydrocarbons are cooled in a condenser and coalesced in a holding tank, wherefrom they may be recirculated into the process and used repeatedly. The now-isolated heavy hydrocarbons resulting from the distillation process may be removed as a purified product.",THAYER IAN;;THOMPSON PAUL;;GAGO RONALD;;CLARK DONALD;;AZBILL KEITH,THAYER IAN;;THOMPSON PAUL;;GAGO RONALD;;CLARK DONALD;;AZBILL KEITH,,https://lens.org/191-039-645-138-109,Granted Patent,yes,5,0,2,2,0,C10G1/002;;C10G1/02;;C10G1/045;;C10G1/045;;C10G1/002;;C10G1/02,C10G1/00;;C10G1/04;;C10G1/02,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

These filtering processes may include a series of one or more of centrifuges and nozzle purifier machines. Filtered fluids are distilled to separate heavy hydrocarbons from light hydrocarbons. Simultaneously, the solids are heated to remove the remaining light hydrocarbons as vapors. Light hydrocarbons are cooled in a condenser and coalesced in a holding tank, wherefrom they may be recirculated into the process and used repeatedly.

Photographic printing processes and apparatus therefor. PLESSEY CO. Ltd. May 10, 1967 April 7, 1966], No.15585/66. Heading G2A. Patterns are produced on photographic films by progressively exposing the film to a light spot whilst producing controlled relative movement between the film and spot and utilizing a filter or a shutter to expose the film to the spot before and after such movement so that the pattern is uniformly exposed at both ends thereof. Apparatus for this method comprises a table for supporting the film, an arrangement for projecting a rectangular light spot on film, means for producing relative movement of the table and spot along co-ordinate axes and either a filter or a shutter for producing uniform exposure of the film at the start and finish of the movement. As shown, a photographic film (not shown) is placed on table 1 which can be moved in the X and Y plates by drive mechanisms 4 and 5. Above the film is a lens shutter assembly 8 and bellows 7. Light from lamp 13 passes through locating holes 9 and cut out 10 in opaque screen 12 and is focused on the film by opening shutter 16. The square hole 11 is then focused on the film and exposed by a tungsten iodide lamp 14, the size of the hole being adjustable preferably by using a second opaque screen with square holes of varying size. The exposure is adjusted by progressively opening the shutter in the direction of movement of the film so that on subsequent moving the film the film is not doubly exposed. Similarly, after the end of movement of the film, the shutter is progressively closed in the direction of movement of the film. Alternatively, uniform exposure is achieved by covering the square hole with a graded filter which passes all light at the rear end of the film before movement and reversing the filter after movement of the film. The position of the table can be determined by generating electrical impulses when drive mechanisms 4 and 5 are moved or alternatively electrical impulses may be used to drive the mechanisms 4 and 5.",PLESSEY CO LTD,MADDISON JOHN CLARK;;MICHAEL PETER COLIN;;CHAPMAN RONALD GEORGE JOSEPH,,https://lens.org/021-498-267-407-532,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G03F7/70308;;G03F7/70358;;G03F7/704;;H10N97/00,G03F7/20;;H01L49/02,G2A ACH           CH;;G2A A404          CH;;G2A A406          CH;;G2A A412          CH;;G2A A415          CH;;G2A A443          CH;;G2A A449          CH;;G2A A464          CH;;G2A A473          CH;;G2A A556          CH;;G2A A558          CH;;G2A A563          CH;;G2A A682          CH;;G2A A684          CH;;G2A A701          CH;;G2A A712          CH;;G2A A745          CH,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Materials containing heavy hydrocarbons (i.e. oil sands or roofing shingles) are broken up into an auger and then mixed with light hydrocarbons. Subsequently, the resulting slurry is shaken to separate fluids from solids, and the fluids are subjected to one or more filtering processes to remove waste sediment. These filtering processes may include a series of one or more of centrifuges and nozzle purifier machines. Filtered fluids are distilled to separate heavy hydrocarbons from light hydrocarbons. Simultaneously, the solids are heated to remove the remaining light hydrocarbons as vapors. Light hydrocarbons are cooled in a condenser and coalesced in a holding tank, wherefrom they may be recirculated into the process and used repeatedly. The now-isolated heavy hydrocarbons resulting from the distillation process may be removed as a purified product.",THAYER IAN;;AZBILL KEITH;;THOMPSON PAUL;;GAGO RONALD;;CLARK DONALD,THAYER IAN;;AZBILL KEITH;;THOMPSON PAUL;;GAGO RONALD;;CLARK DONALD,,https://lens.org/114-741-747-391-858,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,C10G1/04,C10G1/04;;C10G1/00;;C10G1/02,,0,0,,,,PENDING

At least the first alkylation reaction zone is operated under conditions of temperature and pressure effective to cause alkylation of the aromatic compound with the alkene in the presence of the alkylation catalyst, the temperature and pressure being such that the aromatic compound is partly in the vapor phase and partly in the liquid phase. An effluent comprising the alkylaromatic compound, unreacted alkylatable aromatic compound, any unreacted alkene and the alkane is withdrawn from the first alkylation reaction zone and at least part of the alkane is removed from the effluent to produce an alkane-depleted effluent.

   A process is described for producing an alkylaromatic compound by reacting an alkylatable aromatic compound with a feed comprising an alkene and an alkane in a multistage reaction system comprising at least first and second series-connected alkylation reaction zones each containing an alkylation catalyst. At least the first alkylation reaction zone is operated under conditions of temperature and pressure effective to cause alkylation of the aromatic compound with the alkene in the presence of the alkylation catalyst, the temperature and pressure being such that the aromatic compound is partly in the vapor phase and partly in the liquid phase. An effluent comprising the alkylaromatic compound, unreacted alkylatable aromatic compound, any unreacted alkene and the alkane is withdrawn from the first alkylation reaction zone and at least part of the alkane is removed from the effluent to produce an alkane-depleted effluent. The alkane-depleted effluent is then supplied to the second alkylation reaction zone.

The object pose estimate and the camera pose estimate form nodes of a pose graph for the map of model instances.",IMPERIAL COLLEGE SCI TECH & MEDICINE,MCCORMAC JOHN BRENDAN;;CLARK RONALD;;BLOESCH MICHAEL;;DAVISON ANDREW;;LEUTENEGGER STEFAN,,https://lens.org/050-432-190-151-531,Patent Application,yes,0,13,11,11,0,G06T2207/10028;;G06T2207/20016;;G06T7/579;;G06T2207/20084;;G06T7/11;;G06T7/162;;G06T7/174;;G06T7/194;;G06T7/73;;G06T2207/10028;;G06V10/464;;G06T7/579;;G06T7/11;;G06T7/162;;G06T7/174;;G06T7/194;;G06T7/73;;G06T2207/10028;;G06T2207/20016;;G06T2207/20084;;G06T7/50;;G06T7/11;;G06T7/30;;G06T7/75;;G06T7/251;;G05D1/0251;;G05D1/0253;;G06T2207/10016;;G06T2207/10024;;G06T2207/10028;;G06T2207/20072;;G06T2207/20076;;G06T2207/20084;;G06T2207/30244;;G06V20/46;;G06F18/25;;G06T7/579,G06T7/579,,10,3,003-658-282-490-386;;008-282-615-311-825;;008-783-981-093-093,10.1007/978-3-319-29451-3_43;;10.1109/iros.2017.8206392;;10.1007/978-3-642-33715-4_54,"FIORAIO NICOLA ET AL: ""Towards Semantic KinectFusion"", 9 September 2013, INTELLIGENT VIRTUAL AGENT.

This unit takes advantage of improvements in the integrated circuit art to minimize the number of physical units required to provide the desired memory capacity while simultaneously maximizing density and thereby minimizing signal path length. Basically the package contains a plurality of stacked semiconductor wafers each of which provides either integrated memory or logic functions. Each semiconductor wafer is mounted on an insulated wafer carrier and is connected to stacking pins around the perimeter of the carrier via a series of radial interconnection which are flexible expansion leads disposed around the outer edge of the wafer. Each wafer is floatation mounted by attaching only its center to the carrier to minimize the stress effects of a thermal expansion mismatch between the wafer, the carrier, and the radial interconnections. The carrier on which the wafer is mounted is constructed to mechanically secure and support the wafer at its physical center, to provide electrical contact to the wafer substrate, to provide support of electrical stacking pins which connect with stacking pins on adjacent carriers, to provide support for the radial interconnection expansion leads extending between pads on the wafer and the stacking pins and to minimize the effects of thermal mismatch in the structure. A finned housing encloses the stacked wafers and carriers and is hermetically sealed to a header having feed through termination pin such that the package can contain a liquid coolant which aids in the transfer of heat between the wafers and the finned housing thus maximizing the dissipation of heat from the wafers.",IBM,ARCHEY WILLIAM BOGAN;;AUDI RONALD DOMINIC;;CLARK ROGER JAMES;;REDMOND ROBERT JAMES,,https://lens.org/126-767-452-035-806,Granted Patent,yes,15,149,10,11,0,H01L23/427;;H01L23/5385;;H01L2224/48091;;H01L2224/48227;;H01L2224/48472;;H01L2924/01014;;H01L2924/0102;;H01L2924/01039;;H01L2924/19041;;H01L24/48;;H01L2924/01019;;H01L2924/01021;;H01L2924/10253;;H01L2924/00014;;H01L2924/14;;H01L23/427;;H01L2924/0102;;H01L2224/48472;;H01L2924/01014;;H01L23/5385;;H01L2224/48091;;H01L2924/19041;;H01L2224/48227;;H01L2924/01039;;H01L2924/01019;;H01L2924/01021;;H01L24/48;;H01L2924/10253;;H01L2924/00014;;H01L2924/14,H01L23/04;;H01L23/427;;H01L21/673;;H01L23/538;;H01L25/00,317/100,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Window locations are determined by analyzing received wireless transmissions sent from transmitters associated with each of the optically switchable windows 202. The determined locations are then compared with a representation of a building 204 that provides the window locations. Based on the comparison, a network ID of each window communicated via the window transmission is associated with an appropriate window location on the representation of the building.SELECTED DRAWING: Figure 2B",VIEW INC,DHAIRYA SHRIVASTAVA;;WANG JUE;;STEPHEN CLARK BROWN;;DAVID AMMERLAAN;;RONALD F CADET,,https://lens.org/161-048-367-439-871,Patent Application,no,5,0,25,1624,0,G02F1/163;;E06B9/24;;E06B2009/2405;;E06B2009/2417;;E06B9/24;;H04L12/00;;H04L12/2809;;H04L12/282;;E06B2009/2464;;G06F3/04815;;E06B9/24;;G06Q50/10;;E06B2009/2464;;E06B2009/2417;;E06B2009/2405,E06B5/00;;E06B7/28;;E06B9/24;;G02F1/15;;G02F1/163;;H04B1/7163;;H04Q9/00,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
