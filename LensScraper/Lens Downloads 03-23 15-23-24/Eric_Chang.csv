    A stream of input speech is coupled as an input to a speech recognizer. The speech can be provided to the speech recognizer directly from a user or first stored and provided from a memory circuit. Each input word is recognized by the speech recognizer and a word confidence score is associated with each corresponding recognized word. The recognized words and their associated word confidence scores are provided to a natural language interpreter which parses the stream of recognized words into predetermined edges. From the edges, the natural language interpreter forms semantic slots which represent a semantic meaning. A slot confidence score related to the word or phone confidence scores for each of the words in the slot is determined for each slot. Based upon the slot confidence score, an ancillary application program determines whether to accept the words used to fill each slot. If the slot is rejected, the application program can request the user to repeat the information necessary to fill that slot only, rather than requiring the user to repeat the entire stream of input speech.

In an embodiment, a first compiler compiles source code of a target function to generate ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled machine code. A second compiler compiles the source code to generate an intermediate representation (IR) of the target function. In response to determining that the target function should be just-in-time (JIT) compiled, the AOT-compiled machine code for the target function is linked to the IR of the target function. During runtime, a physical processor executes AOT-compiled machine code of an executable program. When the target function is encountered for the first time, a JIT compiler is invoked. The JIT compiler generates JIT-compiled machine code for the target function.

In an embodiment, a first compiler compiles source code of a target function to generate ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled machine code. A second compiler compiles the source code to generate an intermediate representation (IR) of the target function. In response to determining that the target function should be just-in-time (JIT) compiled, the AOT-compiled machine code for the target function is linked to the IR of the target function. During runtime, a physical processor executes AOT-compiled machine code of an executable program. When the target function is encountered for the first time, a JIT compiler is invoked. The JIT compiler generates JIT-compiled machine code for the target function. The physical processor executes the JIT-compiled machine code in place of the AOT-compiled machine code for the target function.",ORACLE INT CORP,CHAFI HASSAN;;CHANG MASON;;SEDLAR ERIC,,https://lens.org/021-165-713-335-642,Patent Application,yes,11,6,4,4,0,G06F8/443;;G06F9/45516;;G06F8/41;;G06F9/45525;;G06F8/47;;G06F8/443;;G06F9/45516;;G06F8/4441,G06F9/45,717/148,6,3,055-109-112-611-872;;093-931-491-934-755;;031-180-027-780-840,10.5626/jcse.2012.6.1.26;;10.1109/ipdps.2003.1213259;;10.1145/1929501.1929508,"Bouakaz, Adnan, ""Predictability of Just-In-Time Compilation"" 2010, pp. 1-15.;;Wang, Chih-Sheng, et al., ""A method-based ahead-of-time compiler for android applications"", 2011, pp. 15-24.;;Ogawa, Hirotaka, et al., ""Compile-time Optimization and Customization in Java and C + MPI"", 2009, pp. 1-170.;;Sun, Yu, et al., ""Time-Predictable Java Dynamic Compilation on Multicore Processors"", 2012, pp. 26-38.;;Odaira, Ray, et al., ""Selective Optimization of Locks by Runtime Statistics and Just-in-time Compilation"", 2003, pp. 1-6.;;Bolz, Carl Friedrich, et al., ""Allocation removal by partial evaluation in a tracing JIT"", 2011, pp. 43-52.",ACTIVE

In an embodiment, a first compiler compiles source code of a target function to generate ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled machine code. A second compiler compiles the source code to generate an intermediate representation (IR) of the target function. In response to determining that the target function should be just-in-time (JIT) compiled, the AOT-compiled machine code for the target function is linked to the IR of the target function. During runtime, a physical processor executes AOT-compiled machine code of an executable program. When the target function is encountered for the first time, a JIT compiler is invoked. The JIT compiler generates JIT-compiled machine code for the target function. The physical processor executes the JIT-compiled machine code in place of the AOT-compiled machine code for the target function.",ORACLE INT CORP,CHAFI HASSAN;;CHANG MASON;;SEDLAR ERIC,,https://lens.org/156-961-994-027-605,Granted Patent,yes,31,7,4,4,0,G06F8/443;;G06F9/45516;;G06F8/41;;G06F9/45525;;G06F8/47;;G06F8/443;;G06F9/45516;;G06F8/4441,G06F9/45;;G06F9/455,,12,5,055-109-112-611-872;;093-931-491-934-755;;031-180-027-780-840;;012-569-669-276-458;;150-510-374-214-820,10.5626/jcse.2012.6.1.26;;10.1109/ipdps.2003.1213259;;10.1145/1929501.1929508;;10.1109/cgo.2007.5;;10.1145/1993316.1993508,"Bouakaz, Adnan, ""Predictability of Just-In-Time Compilation"" 2010, pp. 1-15.;;Wang, Chih-Sheng, et al., ""A method-based ahead-of-time compiler for android applications"", 2011, pp. 15-24.;;Ogawa, Hirotaka, et al., ""Compile-time Optimization and Customization in Java and C + MPI"", 2009, pp. 1-170.;;Sun, Yu, et al., ""Time-Predictable Java Dynamic Compilation on Multicore Processors"", 2012, pp. 26-38.;;Odaira, Ray, et al., ""Selective Optimization of Locks by Runtime Statistics and Just-in-time Compilation"", 2003, pp. 1-6.;;Bolz, Carl Friedrich, et al., ""Allocation removal by partial evaluation in a tracing JIT"", 2011, pp. 43-52.;;Wang et al., A Method-Based Ahead-of-Time Complier for Android Applications, dated 2011, pp. 15-24.;;Lim et al., A Selective a head-of-Time Compiler on Android Device, dated 2012, 6 pages.;;Fulton et al., Compilation Techniques for Real-Time Java Programs, dated 2007, 11 pages.;;Erhardt, Christoph et al., Exploting Static Application Knowledge in a Java Compiler for Embedded Systems: A Case Study, dated 2001, pp. 96-105.;;Bohm, Igor et al., Generalized Just-in-Time Trace Compilation Using a Parallel Task Farm in a Dynamic Binary Translator, dated 2011, pp. 74-85.;;Arnold, Matthew et al., Dynamic Compilation and Adaptive Optimization in Virtual Machines, dated 2006, 184 pages.",ACTIVE

The decoupling mechanisms can be compliant in a direction along a radial direction of said radial arm and rigid in a direction perpendicular to said radial arm. The decoupling mechanisms can decouple the stiffener from thermally induced differential radial contraction and expansion of the stiffener relative to the cardholder to which the stiffener is mounted. This can reduce thermally-induced vertical translation of the probe card assembly.,FORMFACTOR INC,CHANG KEVIN S;;HOBBS ERIC D,,https://lens.org/117-900-178-684-419,Patent of Addition,no,0,5,6,6,0,G01R1/07378;;G01R31/2891;;G01R1/07378;;G01R31/2891,G01R1/073,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Each G i in {G j , . . . G N } includes a causal relationship between a parent and child node. {G I , G N } demonstrate Markov equivalence. Observed data D is obtained for the nodes. For each respective G i , the marginal probability of a parent node x i in G i is clamped by D while computing a distribution of marginal probabilities for a child node y i , by Bayesian network or Dynamic Bayesian network belief propagation using an interaction function.

    A system is disclosed for improving the operation of a circuit having one or more semiconductor devices as temperature varies over the circuit's typical range of operating temperatures. In an environment of a current mirror, the invention can be used to reduce variation in the reference current as temperature changes. This is particularly desirable at low operating voltages. In one embodiment, the invention is configured as a current compensation module connected to a current mirror regulator node. At normal temperature, the current mirror reference current and the compensation module are configured to provide the desired amount of reference current to the current mirror. At temperatures above normal, the current compensation module automatically conducts more current than at normal temperature. At temperatures below normal, the current compensation module conducts less current than at normal temperature. This manner of compensation counteracts the undesirable changes in semiconductor behavior that occur when the operating temperature of the circuit changes.

In an embodiment, a first compiler compiles source code of a target function to generate ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled machine code. A second compiler compiles the source code to generate an intermediate representation (IR) of the target function. In response to determining that the target function should be just-in-time (JIT) compiled, the AOT-compiled machine code for the target function is linked to the IR of the target function. During runtime, a physical processor executes AOT-compiled machine code of an executable program. When the target function is encountered for the first time, a JIT compiler is invoked. The JIT compiler generates JIT-compiled machine code for the target function.

The inner diameter of the winding chain outer tube is matched with the outer diameter of the winding chain inner tube so as to have a smaller front end and a larger rear end. Moreover, an elastic element is installed at a position between the front end of the winding chain inner tube and the front wall of the winding chain outer tube so that the winding chain inner tube generates a continuously front pulling force to the winding chain outer tube. Once a wear from rotation friction therebetween is formed, the winding chain inner tube will move forwards gradually so as to automatically adjust and compensate the gap from the wear. That is, the outer diameter of the winding chain inner tube tightly contacts with the inner diameter of the winding chain outer tube until the stopping ring ejects against the rear wall of the winding chain outer tube so as not be adjusted again. As a result, the winding chain dissipating block formed by two winding chain dissipating units can be applied to a pivotal portion between the mainframe seat of a notebook computer and a screen seat.

The prediction circuit is configured to predict whether or not a first load instruction will experience a partial store to load forward (PSTLF) event during execution. A PSTLF event occurs if a plurality of bytes, accessed responsive to the first load instruction during execution, include at least a first byte updated responsive to a previous uncommitted store operation and also include at least a second byte not updated responsive to the previous uncommitted store operation. Coupled to receive the first load instruction, the circuit is configured to generate one or more load operations responsive to the first load instruction. The load operations are to be executed in the processor to execute the first load instruction, and a number of the load operations is dependent on the prediction by the prediction circuit.",APPLE INC,KADAMBI SUDARSHAN;;CHANG PO-YUNG;;HAO ERIC,APPLE INC (2009-05-08),https://lens.org/113-076-016-127-347,Granted Patent,yes,67,3,6,6,0,G06F9/30043;;G06F9/30145;;G06F9/3834;;G06F9/3017;;G06F9/3838;;G06F9/3826;;G06F9/3834;;G06F9/30145;;G06F9/30043;;G06F9/3017;;G06F9/3838;;G06F9/3826,G06F9/00;;G06F7/38,712/225;;712/220,9,6,030-806-047-194-916;;035-378-437-114-639;;024-790-423-572-87X;;027-104-424-987-387;;002-693-682-750-359;;139-059-999-878-350,10.1109/cmpcon.1997.584667;;10.1109/40.87564;;10.1109/micro.1997.645814;;10.1109/hpca.1998.650559;;10.1145/279361.279378;;10.1145/384286.264189,"Leibholz, et al., ""The Alpha 21264: A 500 MHz Out-of-Order Execution Microprocessor,"" Copyright 1997, IEEE, pp. 28-36.;;Popescu, et al., ""The Metaflow Architecture,"" IEEE Micro Jun. 1991, pp. 10-13 and 63-73.;;Moshovos, et al., ""Speculative Memory Cloaking and Bypassing,"" pp. 1-15, Oct. 1999.;;Moshovos, et al., ""Streamlining Inter-Operation Memory Communication via Data Dependence Predictions,"" IEEE pp. 1-11, Dec. 1997.;;Gopal, et al., ""Speculative Versioning Cache,"" pp. 1-11, Feb. 1998.;;Chrysos, et al., ""Memory Dependence Prediction Using Store Sets,"" Copyright 1998, IEEE, pp. 142-153.;;Moshovos, et al., ""Dynamic Speculation and Synchronization of Data Dependences,"" Copyright 1997, ACM pp. 181-193.;;Johnson, ""Superscalar Microprocessor Design,"" Prentice-Hall, 1991, pp. 127-129.;;Gwennap, ""Digital 21264 Sets New Standard,"" Microdesign Resources, vol. 10, No. 14, Oct. 1996, pp. 103-108.",ACTIVE

    The invention provides a planar waveguide diffractive 1N beam splitter/coupler. It utilizes an integrated circuit fabrication process to fabricate an integrated optic. A Fourier transform diffractive optical element (DOE) is formed on one end of a planar waveguide (planar lightwave circuit; PLC). Thus, an incident beam coming from one end of the planar waveguide can be diffracted into a plurality of output beams. On the other hand, a plurality of incident beams coming from one end of the planar waveguide can be coupled into one output beam. The beam splitter/coupler is easy to fabricate, small in size and more flexible for applications.

    A method for performing a synchronized order change in a manufacturing process is provided. An order is associated with an order number and a work in process (WIP) number, which identifies a physical lot corresponding to the order. The synchronized order change maintains a relationship between the order number and the WIP number while making the change. This avoids the need to scrap lots that are no longer associated with an order number and prevents holds from being placed on incorrect lots.

    A method and system that creates a rule-based Operation Job Supervisor System (OJS) or decision engine to automate and control Fab production for the optimum movement of wafer boxes through the Fab. It is integrated with current manufacturing control systems and a cooperative model between the dispatching and scheduling functions. This easy-to-maintain system architecture makes use of a dynamic evaluation formula and sub-formula that can handle exception cases and consider wafer box physical position concurrently. Because the decision engine is rule based, rule can be revised without need for re-compiling and shutting down the system. New patterns are learned by the system automatically when variables and parameters in the formulas are revised.

   A high availability backplane architecture. The backplane system includes redundant node boards operatively communicating with redundant switch fabric boards. Uplink ports of the node boards are logically grouped into trunk ports at one end of the communication link with the switch fabric boards. The node boards and the switch fabric boards routinely perform link integrity checks when operating in a normal mode such that each can independently initiate failover to working ports when a link failure is detected. Link failure is detected either by sending a link heartbeat message after the link has had no traffic for a predetermined interval, or after receiving a predetermined consecutive number of invalid packets. Once the link failure is resolved, operation resumes in normal mode.
