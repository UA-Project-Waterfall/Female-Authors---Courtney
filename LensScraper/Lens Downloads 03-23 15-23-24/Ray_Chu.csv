    Revascularization of an ischemic myocardium is achieved through the stimulation of angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation) by causing an injury to the heart via puncturing and traversing the ischemic myocardium from the epicardium to the endocardium simultaneously, at a plurality of spaced apart sites, with a plurality of needles, and simultaneously withdrawing the plurality of needles from the punctured ischemic myocardium; the technique and the device have advantages over the use of lasers for this purpose an additional advantage is that the revascularization can be performed without open chest surgery or conventional sternotomy although it can also be employed in conjunction with these surgical procedures; thus, by way of example, the revascularization can be performed transthoracically; with a t sternotomy, a thoractomy incision or thoracoscopically; the puncturing operation may also be employed in myogenesis of a myocardium by delivery of desired agents to the myocardium through the puncturing needles; such myogenesis may be carried out simultaneously with revascularization of an ischemic or failing myocardium or as an independent operation.

The dual band array antenna is essentially two antennas sharing a common antenna aperture. The two antennas possess separate feed system and beam steering control. Thus, the beams for each frequency band can be steered independently and simultaneously. This design utilizes an ultra-wide band radiating element (300) which can operate over approximately an octave bandwidth encompassing two adjacent microwave bands. In particular, the dual band signals can be received efficiently by the radiating element. A dual band coaxial-to-waveguide transition (301) can be used to carry the signals to a diplexer (302). The dual band signals are separated at the diplexer (302) and can be processed in separate feed networks (104, 105).

The trip oil system applies hydraulic pressure to actuate and hold open a fuel shut-off valve so that fuel flows to the combustor of the gas turbine. When the trip oil system relieves the hydraulic pressure, the fuel shut-off valve closes and stops the fuel flow to the combustor. A bank of three solenoid valves controls the application of hydraulic pressure to each fuel shut-off valve. Hydraulic fluid conduits interconnect the three solenoid valves such that no single valve by itself can relieve the hydraulic pressure applied to the fuel shut-off valve. During normal operation of the gas turbine, all three redundant solenoid valves are activated.

The dual band array antenna is essentially two antennas sharing a common antenna aperture. The two antennas possess separate feed system and beam steering control. Thus, the beams for each frequency band can be steered independently and simultaneously. This design utilizes an ultra-wide band radiating element which can operate over approximately an octave bandwidth encompassing two adjacent microwave bands. In particular, the dual band signals can be received efficiently by the radiating element. A dual band coaxial-to-waveguide transition can be used to carry the signals to a diplexer. The dual band signals are separated at the diplexer and can be processed in separate feed networks. The advantages of this dual band phased array technique include not only good impedance characteristics but also the absence of grating lobe formation and cross coupling problems.",HUGHES AIRCRAFT CO,LEE KUAN M;;WONG NAM S;;CHU RUEY S;;TANG RAY,HUGHES AIRCRAFT COMPANY A CORP.

The taps are selected in order to achieve the desired shift between bit streams. In addition, the tap patterns can be selected so that the number of inputs (fan-in) to each bit stream are within predetermined bounds and that the number of taps per cell (cell load ) are within predetermined bounds. A disclosed computer program generates the tap patterns as a function of the number of cells and the structure of the LFSR, the number of output bit streams, the maximum allowed shift variation of the bit streams, and the bounds on fan-in and cell load.
