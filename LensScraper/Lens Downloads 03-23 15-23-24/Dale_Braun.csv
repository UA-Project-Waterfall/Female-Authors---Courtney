Local controlled release administration of the drug is added to the contraceptive effect of the preexisting platform. The IUD attachment be made by centrifuging a medical grade of RTV silicone rubber to remove reinforcing fillers therefrom. A selected quantity of the drug is mixed into the fillers silicone rubber, and the drug and silicone mixture is injected into a multicavity mold (40). After the mixture sets and the sleeves(16) are removed from the mold, the sleeves are trimmed, then swollen by immersion in a solvent, and slipped onto a stem 12 of the chosen IUD (11) to shrink about the stem. An outer covering (17) over the sleeve (16) can control the drug release rate and impart greater strength to the fillerless silicone rubber of the attachment (15). The outer covering (17) can be a tube likewise swollen and slipped onto the sleeve to tightly shrink thereon. The multicavity mold (40) has two clamped-together plates (43, 44) with aligned half cavities(46), an injection opening (53) adapted to fit an injection syringe (20) and alignment grooves (57) to hold tubes (41) or pins that form the axial openings through the sleeves (16). The syringe (20) is made especially for use with the moldy. Its size is matched to the quantity of mixture needed, and its injection nipple 23 mates with the mold input opening (53).",POPULATION COUNCIL INC,ROBERTSON DALE N;;BRAUN JOHN,,https://lens.org/163-564-616-073-991,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,,A61F13/20,128-52,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The rollover sensing apparatus includes an angular rate sensor for sensing attitude rate of change of a vehicle and producing an output signal indicative thereof. The rollover sensing apparatus also has an integrator for integrating the sensed attitude rate of change signal over a variable time window and producing an attitude angle. The rollover sensing apparatus further includes a deployment logic for comparing the attitude angle and attitude rate of change to a pair of variable threshold value with a gray-zone that varies based on time, and an output for deploying a vehicle overturn condition signal based on the comparison. Adaptive bias removal and output minimum logic reduces bias and noise associated with the sensed signal.
