For example, the lipidic compound-telodendrimer hybrid nanoparticles are lipid/lipidoid-telodendrimer hybrid nanoparticles. The nanoparticles can comprise a plurality of lipidic molecules (e.g., lipid molecules, lipidoid molecules, or mixtures of different lipid molecules or different lipidoid molecules). The hybrid nanoparticles can comprise one or more lipid or lipidoid and one or more telodendrimer. The hybrid nanoparticles can also comprise cholesterol. In various examples, the hybrid nanoparticles also comprise a small molecule, peptide, protein, or a combination thereof. In various examples, lipid-telodendrimer hybrid nanoparticles comprising one or more small molecules or lipidoid-telodendrimer hybrid nanoparticles comprising one or more protein(s) and/or peptide(s) are used in methods of small-molecule or protein/peptide delivery.",UNIV NEW YORK STATE RES FOUND,LUO JUNTAO;;WANG XU;;SHI CHANGYING;;BODMAN ALEXA;;HALL WALTER,,https://lens.org/141-520-106-986-560,Patent Application,yes,0,14,1,1,1,A61K9/1273;;A61K9/1273,A61K47/34,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
