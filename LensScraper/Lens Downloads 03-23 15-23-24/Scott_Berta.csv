Specifically, the present manufacturing process provides faster variant turnaround times, shorter clean-up times between variants, significant material waste reduction and smaller effluent volumes than those of typical batch systems. As well, a process has been developed for more efficient 10 addition of materials which are dissimilar in chemical composition and/or physical parameters to the original base material or of materials which may be temperature and shear sensitive.",PROCTER & GAMBLE,BERTA JAMES ALBERT;;HOWE DAVID SCOTT;;FARREN DAVID MICHAEL;;MILLER STEVE PAUL;;DE LA HARPE SHANE MICHAEL;;DEISTER VOLKER BERNHARD;;CULLINANE JEFF TIMOTHY,,https://lens.org/089-110-098-438-840,Patent Application,no,0,0,12,12,0,G05D11/133;;G05D11/133,A61Q11/00;;B01F3/08;;G05D11/13,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
