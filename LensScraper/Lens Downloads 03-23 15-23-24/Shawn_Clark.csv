The systems include an automatic swimming pool cleaner incorporating one or more curved wipers protruding from its lower surface. The wipers and flat bottom of the cleaner induce a vortex as fluid flows to its central inlet, entraining debris in the flow. A fluted throat surrounding the inlet additionally assists the interior of the base of the cleaner in retaining debris when opened for cleaning, additionally providing an improved flow path for enhanced debris pick-up. Also disclosed is a valve useful for controlling and indicating the rate of fluid flow to a cleaner. Included within the valve is a plunger attached to a spring, with the spring force opposing fluid flow through the valve. Flow sufficient to overcome the spring force compresses the spring, however, thereby moving the plunger within the tube and providing a dynamic indication of the rate of fluid flow.

The compounds comprise a residue of a sugar or sugar derivative linked by an amine, amide, imide, or urea group to a non-sugar substituent comprising one or more alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, oxyalkylene, polyoxalkylene groups, or a mixture thereof. Disclosed are exemplary compounds for dispersing particles and for modifying properties of hydratable compositions, such as cementitious mixtures (e.g., concrete, masonry, mortar, or cement), as well as methods for making the compounds and for modifying particle-containing compositions. The compounds and methods are useful for increasing fluidity, strength, grinding performance, or other properties in cements and cementitious compositions.

The present disclosure also provides methods and compositions for determining the load of fetal polynucleotides in a biological sample, e.g., the load of fetal polynucleotides (e.g., DNA, RNA) in maternal plasma. The present disclosure provides methods and compositions for detecting cellular processes such as cellular viability, growth rates, and infection rates. This disclosure also provides compositions and methods for detecting differences in copy number of a target polynucleotide. In some embodiments, the methods and compositions provided herein are useful for diagnosis of fetal genetic abnormalities, when the starting sample is maternal tissue (e.g., blood, plasma).

The display may be overlapped by an image transport layer such as a coherent fiber bundle or layer of Anderson localization material. The image transport layer may have an input surface that receives an image from the display and a corresponding output surface to which the image is transported. The input surface and output surface may have different shapes. During fabrication of the image transport layer, molding techniques, grinding and polishing techniques, and other processes are used to deform the image transport layer and the shape of the output surface. The area of peripheral portions of the output surface may expand relative to central portions.
