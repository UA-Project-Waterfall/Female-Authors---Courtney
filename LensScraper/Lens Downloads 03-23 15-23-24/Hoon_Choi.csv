A pump-up circuit generates a pump-up voltage from a power supply voltage, wherein the pump-up voltage is greater than the power supply voltage. The pump-up voltage is applied to the gates of the field effect transistors to activate the redundancy circuit. According to another aspect, a redundancy circuit for an integrated circuit memory device comprises a repair controlling circuit that includes a repair fuse and that generates a repair control signal in response to opening of the repair control fuse. The enable controlling circuit is responsive to the repair controlling circuit and includes an enable fuse to generate a redundant enable signal in response to the repair control signal and opening of the enable fuse. A redundancy signal generator is responsive to the enable controlling circuit to generate a selection signal for a redundant memory cell in response to receipt of an address of a defective memory cell.

The present invention minimizes a possibility that a target species is able to visually recognize a needle by minimizing the overall length at which the needle is combined with the spoon lure main body so that the target fish species is able to bite the spoon lure main body and the needle together or swallow the bitten object immediately without feeling of irritation upon biting the fish. To this end, the integrated spoon lure has the elastically operable needle combined with the spoon lure main body in a united body. Accordingly, the present invention is able to: increase a hooking probability by making a target species bite the spoon lure main body and the needle together or inducing a natural operation in which the target species immediately swallows the object upon biting the same; improve the efficiency of lure fishing; and minimize the phenomenon of underwater jamming which may occur when moving a fishing rod while waiting for a target species after dropping a spoon lure under the water.",CHOI BYUNG HOON,CHOI BYUNG HOON,,https://lens.org/061-588-682-151-896,Patent Application,no,1,1,1,1,0,A01K91/04;;A01K83/00;;A01K85/14,A01K85/00;;A01K83/00;;A01K91/04,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
