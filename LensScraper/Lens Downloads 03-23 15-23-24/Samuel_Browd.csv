   A vacuum fixation device to provide semi-rigid head fixation during medical imaging and medical procedures/operations of the face and head is disclosed. The invention addresses the problem of patient movement during medical/imaging procedures. The invention is a vacuum fixation bag that is designed to provide maximum surface area contact with the subject's head creating semi-rigid immobilization while allowing access to the face and cranial vault. The invention is comprised of an airtight flexible bag containing an effective amount of Styrofoam beads and a closable port providing semi-rigid fixation. The bag is especially configured to provide stabilization to the neck, the under surface of the mandible, the lateral head around the peri-auricular surfaces, and the forehead. The current invention is provided as a sterile, single use item that provides semi-rigid head fixation during medical imaging and medical procedures/operations of the face and head.

In some embodiments, a method of intraoperatively determining an alignment parameter of a spine during a surgical procedure includes receiving initial image data of the spine including multiple vertebrae and identifying a geometric feature associated with each vertebra in the initial image data. The geometric features each have a pose in the initial image data and characterize a three-dimensional (3D) shape of the associated vertebra. The method further comprises receiving intraoperative image data of the spine and registering the initial image data to the intraoperative image data. The method can then update the pose of each geometric feature based on the registration and the intraoperative image data, and determine the alignment parameter based on the updated poses of the geometric features associated with two or more of the vertebrae.",PROPRIO INC,GRUPP JR ROBERT BRUCE;;FIORELLA DAVID LEE;;CARLS THOMAS A;;BROWD SAMUEL R;;JONES ADAM GABRIEL;;YOUNGQUIST JAMES ANDREW;;SIMPKINSON RICHARD EARL,PROPRIO INC (2022-05-03),https://lens.org/134-763-296-433-029,Patent Application,yes,18,1,2,2,0,A61B34/20;;A61B2034/2065;;A61B2090/365;;A61B2090/372;;A61B2090/502;;A61B2034/2057;;A61B2034/2068;;A61B2090/367;;A61B2090/371;;A61B2034/2051;;G16H20/40;;G16H50/50;;G16H30/40;;A61B34/10;;A61B17/8863;;G06T2207/30012;;A61B2034/2055;;G16H50/50,A61B34/10;;A61B17/88;;G16H50/50,,0,0,,,,PENDING
