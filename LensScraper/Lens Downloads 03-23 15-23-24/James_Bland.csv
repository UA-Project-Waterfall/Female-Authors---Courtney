Burners, applications of; vaporizing-apparatus.-Relates to burning-off and brazing tools and the like, of the kind which comprise a tubular oil reservoir forming a handle from which the oil is forced through a vaporizing-coil to a burner between it and the reservoir. The invention consists in providing one or more flat chambers between the burner and reservoir for cooling purposes, and in means for ensuring constant pressure in the reservoir. The reservoir a is connected to the vaporizer p by pipes and a series of flat chambers h, i, l, the upper one of which is formed as a starting-cup. The ends of the vaporizer p communicate with two chambers in the base r of the burner o. The base r has projecting studs t, one of which receives a screw u adapted to clamp a flame tube v in position. The tool w is supported by stays x provided at their ends with clamping- members y, Fig. 1, which are tightened by nuts z. The reservoir a contains an inflatable bag e which is placed over an air-pump c, and is secured between the reservoir and disk b, by a screw cap d. The disk b has a pressure-reducing valve b<1>.",BLAND HARRY WALTON;;YOUNG JAMES,BLAND HARRY WALTON;;YOUNG JAMES,,https://lens.org/011-880-657-167-428,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,F23D91/02;;F23D2206/0036,F23D99/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

R., and Strange, H. B. March 20. Projectile fuses.-Relates to fuses armed by the pressure of the gases in the gun barrel, and consists mainly in causing this pressure to act on a plunger which bears on a mass of lead or other soft metal and extrudes it through one or more passages. In the form shown in Figs. 2 and 3, lead D is extruded by a plunger E through a passage F<3> and displaces a strong locking-pin F. The lead D is also extruded through a passage G<2> and drives a punch G' through a disk G<3> which seals the passage from a powder charge J to another powder charge N. On impact, the pellet C shears the extruded lead easily and strikes a pin H, and the flash from the powder J is transmitted to the powder N, the explosion of which drives a fulminate charge P against a pin O<2> to explode the main charge of the shell. A ball L, Fig. 3, is arranged in the flash passage to prevent return of flame. The detonator P is contained in a tube O described in Specification 3901/12. In a modification, the lower part of the fuse is dispensed with, and the detonator P is locked and armed in the same way as the pellet C, and moves forward against the pin O<2> by its own inertia on impact.

R., and Strange, H. B. Dec. 18. Projectile fuses.-Relates to fuses having centrifugal safety-bolts, and consists in employing the angular acceleration of the projectile due to the rifling to prevent the bolt from moving into the unlocking position under the action of centrifugal force, until the projectile has left the gun. In the form shown in part longitudinal section in Fig. 3 and in plan in Fig. 4, the inertia pellet E of the detonator is retained before firing by a centrifugal bolt J arranged in a radial passage. A second bolt L, obstructing the outward motion of the bolt J, lies in a passage K so inclined to the passage J that the bolt L tends to fly outwards under the centrifugal force due to the rotation of the projectile but is prevented from doing so by its inertia while the projectile is receiving angular acceleration from the rifling in the sense indicated by the arrow a. This acceleration ceases when the projectile leaves the gun muzzle; the bolt L then moves outwards and releases the bolt J. To prevent accidental displacement of the bolt L before firing, it is held by a device of the type described in Specification 22,899/11, comprising a collar M<1> on a pin M, which is driven forward to release the bolt L on firing by the pressure of the powder gases on a plunger N<1>, which compresses an intermediate lead pellet N. Both the pellet E and the pin M may be retained by suitable shearing pins E<1>, M<2>. In addition to the bolt J, the pellet E is held in position before firing by a bolt which is dislodged on firing by the pressure of the powder gases. The engaging ends of the bolts J, L may be made conical, and instead of the pin M, a weak spring may be employed to keep the pin L in the locking position before firing. In a modification, the bolt J is dispensed with, and the retaining-bolt L, governed by the angular acceleration of the projectile, acts directly upon the pellet E.",HOYLE JAMES ROSSITER;;STRANGE HARRY BLAND,HOYLE JAMES ROSSITER;;STRANGE HARRY BLAND,,https://lens.org/161-614-358-194-175,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,F42C15/30,F42C15/30,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

At a set time after discharge, a time fuse C in the head of the shell ignites the powder in the central tube, which, through ports D<2>, ignites a layer G of explosive mixture adapted to blow out soldered covers A<2> which close ports A' in the shell-casing. The powder D then ignites in succession through the holes D<1>, the charges F, each of which destroys the envelope surrounding the charge of bullets in front of it. These bullets then creep to the forward end of the shell, where they are ejected through the ports A<1> by centrifugal force due to the rotation of the shell. In this manner the groups of bullets are discharged in succession from the shell. The bullets are preferably set in resin or plaster of parts, but they may be embedded in inflammable composition adapted to be ignited and expelled with the bullets. They may be prevented from shifting on discharge by roughening the interior of the casing A. The tube D may be located in or against the wall of the casing. The ports A' may be closed by spring-plugs released during flight. An annular shoulder B<1> on the head of the shell prevents inrush of air at the ports A', and tends to create a suction action assisting the ejection of the bullets.",HOYLE JAMES ROSSITER;;STRANGE HARRY BLAND,HOYLE JAMES ROSSITER;;STRANGE HARRY BLAND,,https://lens.org/189-670-859-250-625,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,F42B12/32,F42B12/32,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   A pretensioner for a vehicle occupant safety restraint has an outer casing that contains a gas generant. An igniter has igniter material disposed within an igniter housing. A pair of electrodes are connected to the igniter material. A grounding path connector link electrically connects the igniter housing to a grounding path. The connector link may be formed by springs connecting the outer case to the grounding electrode and an interference fit connecting the igniter housing to the outer case. The link forms a low resistance path to short circuit undesirable static charges in the unit that would otherwise tend to cause unintentional activation of the pretensioner.

CO2 is provided preferably by decomposition of a constituent of the cement mix, for example Na, Mg or Ca bicarbonate or more particularly ammonium carbamate, carbonate or bicarbonate, or urea. A calcium lignin sulphonate may be present to assist curing. The cement is preferably aluminous with <12% by weight SiO2, and the wet mix may contain additional alumina and/or calcium oxide or precursors thereof. In addition refractory catalyst support materials such as simple oxides of Mg, Sr, Ba, Si, Ti, Zr, Th or Cr or compound oxides such as china clay may be present.

A presente invenção refere-se a sistemas, métodos e técnicas relacionados à aplicação de sensações de sabor simuladas a um usuário quando do consumo (por exemplo, ao comer, ao beber) de itens alimentícios. A percepção do sabor é uma experiência multissensorial, uma vez que ela envolve não somente o paladar, mas outras experiências sensoriais tais como a visão, a audição, o olfato e o tato. A aplicação de uma ou mais experiências sensoriais a um usuário quando o usuário está consumindo um item alimentício pode aumentar à medida que o usuário experimenta o sabor do item alimentício. Por exemplo, a mudança de um aroma ou uma cor que um item alimentício tem afeta a maneira como os usuários percebem enquanto ele é consumido. A mudança de percepções através de estimulação de vários sentidos pode alterar as expectativas de maneira significativamente e de maneiras inesperadas quando estímulos são transferidos ou combinados. Por conseguinte, em algumas modalidades, a presente invenção provê tecnologias (por exemplo, dispositivo(s), sistemas e/ou método(s)) para a aplicação de sensações de sabor simuladas enquanto são consumidos itens alimentícios (por exemplo, itens alimentícios sólidos, uma bebida).",UNIV MAINE SYSTEM,RANASINGHE ARACHCHILAGE NIMESHA RANASINGHE;;MICHAEL GECAWICZ;;JONATHAN ROMAN BLAND;;MEETHA NESAM JAMES RAVINDRAN SANTHAKUMAR,,https://lens.org/156-492-536-658-574,Patent Application,no,0,0,5,5,0,A61L9/125;;A61L2209/13;;A61N1/36034;;A61N1/0546;;A61N1/0548,A61K8/41;;A61K8/49;;A61L9/01,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The cooling tower (30) has a fiber reinforced material skeletal frame (64). Moment-transferring connections are provided in the connections between the elements of the skeletal frame (64). The moment-transferring connections between the frame members are made by bonding the joined elements to a mounting plate (100). The mounting plate (100) may be held in place by mechanical fasteners that bear construction loads until the bonding material cures. The mounting plate (100), columns, beam and mechanical fasteners define construction joints that are capable of bearing construction loads until the bonding material cures. The mounting plate (100), columns, beam and cured bonding material define post-construction joints that are capable of transfering moments from the beam to the columns and are capable of bearing post-construction loads on the joints. The post-construction joints may also include the mechanical fasteners.

SOLUTION: The frame of a cooling tower comprises a vertical column 66 made of a material including reinforced fiber and horizontal beams 68 and 71 extending between the columns 66. Each joining area 61 is covered with a mounting plate and joined by laying out the flat surface of the column 66 and the beams 68 and 71 on the same plane. The column 66 and the beams 68 and 71 are joined with the mounting plate with a bonding agent, thereby forming a moment transmission section 59 and producing substantially no relative movement between the mounting plate and a member joined with the mounting plate so that the moment may be transmitted to the column 66 from the beams 68, 71, 73 and 75. This construction makes it possible to eliminate the need for a brace at the upper level of the frame and reduce cost and be accessible into the cooling tower during repair time.",BALTIMORE AIRCOIL CO INC,SEAWELL JESSE Q;;DALEY TOBY L;;BARDO CHARLES J;;BLAND JAMES A;;MAILEN GREGORY S,,https://lens.org/127-602-520-452-590,Patent Application,no,0,1,17,17,0,E04H5/12;;E04H5/12;;E04H5/12;;F28F25/00;;F28F25/00;;Y10S261/11;;Y10S261/11,E04H5/12,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The cooling tower has a fiber reinforced material skeletal frame. Moment-transferring connections are provided in the connections between the elements of the skeletal frame. The moment-transferring connections between the frame members are made by bonding the joined elements to a mounting plate. The mounting plate may be held in place by mechanical fasteners that bear construction loads until the bonding material cures. The mounting plate, columns, beam and mechanical fasteners define construction joints that are capable of bearing construction loads until the bonding material cures. The mounting plate, columns, beam and cured bonding material define post-construction joints that are capable of transferring moments from the beam to the columns and are capable of bearing post-construction loads on the joints.

   Metallic cloth seals backed by stiff high temperature-resistant shims depend from a bracket for engagement in a slot of a transition piece for sealing between the transition piece and a first-stage nozzle. The high pressure acting on the shim forces the metallic cloth into engagement with the sealing surface in the slot. The lower edge of the shim is bent about, and overlies, the edge of the metallic cloth in a direction toward the sealing surface of the slot to choke any flow from the high pressure region past the seal. Elongated spline seals are also inserted into opposed registering slots of adjacent transition pieces. The spline seals comprise metallic cloth folded onto itself backed by elongated stiff high temperature-resistant shims having lateral edges overlying the lateral edges of the cloth material. The overlying edges prevent leakage flow about the spline seals from the high pressure to the low pressure regions.

The fuel/air premixer mixes fuel and air into a uniform mixture for injection into a combustor reaction zone. The burner also includes an inlet flow conditioner disposed at the air inlet of the fuel/air premixer for controlling a radial and circumferential distribution of incoming air. The pattern of perforations in the inlet flow conditioner is designed such that a uniform air flow distribution is produced at the swirler inlet annulus in both the radial and circumference directions. The premixer includes a swozzle assembly having a series of preferably air foil shaped turning vanes that impart swirl to the airflow entering via the inlet flow conditioner. Each air foil contains internal fuel flow passages that introduce natural gas fuel into the air stream via fuel metering holes that pass through the walls of the air foil shaped turning vanes. By injecting fuel in this manner, an aerodynamically clean flow field is maintained throughout the premixer. By injecting fuel via two separate passages, the fuel/air mixture strength distribution can be controlled in the radial direction to obtain optimum radial concentration profiles for control of emissions, lean blow outs, and combustion driven dynamic pressure activity as machine and combustor load are varied.",GEN ELECTRIC,BATTAGLIOLI JOHN LUIGI;;BECHTEL WILLIAM THEODORE II;;BENOIT JEFFREY ARTHUR;;BLACK STEPHEN HUGH;;BLAND ROBERT JAMES,,https://lens.org/151-821-406-581-487,Granted Patent,no,0,3,12,12,0,F23C7/004;;F23C2900/07001;;F23D14/02;;F23D2206/10;;F23D2900/14021;;F23M9/02;;F23C7/004;;F23D2900/14021;;F23M9/02;;F23D14/02;;F23C2900/07001;;F23D2206/10,F23C7/00;;F23R3/14;;F23C99/00;;F23D14/02;;F23M9/02;;F23R3/28;;F23R3/36,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    Electrical equipment is safeguarded from damage due to faults by a circuit that provides several levels of protection. A semiconductor switch and a current sensor are placed in series with the electrical equipment. When the current to the equipment exceeds a first threshold for a predefined period of time, the semiconductor switch is rendered non-conductive until the circuit is specifically reset. When the current to the equipment exceeds a greater second threshold, a pulsed signal alternately places the semiconductor switch in conductive and non-conductive states so that the average current applied to the equipment is within an acceptable level. Should the current exceed an even greater third threshold, the semiconductor switch is immediately rendered non-conductive until the circuit is manually reset.

   A burner for use in a combustion system of a heavy-duty industrial gas turbine includes a fuel/air premixer having an air inlet, a fuel inlet, and an annular mixing passage. The fuel/air premixer mixes fuel and air into a uniform mixture for injection into a combustor reaction zone. The burner also includes an inlet flow conditioner disposed at the air inlet of the fuel/air premixer for controlling a radial and circumferential distribution of incoming air. The pattern of perforations in the inlet flow conditioner is designed such that a uniform air flow distribution is produced at the swirler inlet annulus in both the radial and circumference directions. The premixer includes a swozzle assembly having a series of preferably air foil shaped turning vanes that impart swirl to the airflow entering via the inlet flow conditioner. Each air foil contains internal fuel flow passages that introduce natural gas fuel into the air stream via fuel metering holes that pass through the walls of the air foil shaped turning vanes. By injecting fuel in this manner, an aerodynamically clean flow field is maintained throughout the premixer. By injecting fuel via two separate passages, the fuel/air mixture strength distribution can be controlled in the radial direction to obtain optimum radial concentration profiles for control of emissions, lean blow outs, and combustion driven dynamic pressure activity as machine and combustor load are varied.

    A burner for use in a combustion system of a heavy-duty industrial gas turbine includes a fuel/air premixer having an air inlet, a fuel inlet, and an annular mixing passage. The fuel/air premixer mixes fuel and air into a uniform mixture for injection into a combustor reaction zone. The burner also includes an inlet flow conditioner disposed at the air inlet of the fuel/air premixer for controlling a radial and circumferential distribution of incoming air. The pattern of perforations in the inlet flow conditioner is designed such that a uniform air flow distribution is produced at the swirler inlet annulus in both the radial and circumference directions. The premixer includes a swozzle assembly having a series of preferably air foil shaped turning vanes that impart swirl to the airflow entering via the inlet flow conditioner. Each air foil contains internal fuel flow passages that introduce natural gas fuel into the air stream via fuel metering holes that pass through the walls of the air foil shaped turning vanes. By injecting fuel in this manner, an aerodynamically clean flow field is maintained throughout the premixer. By injecting fuel via two separate passages, the fuel/air mixture strength distribution can be controlled in the radial direction to obtain optimum radial concentration profiles for control of emissions, lean blow outs, and combustion driven dynamic pressure activity as machine and combustor load are varied.
