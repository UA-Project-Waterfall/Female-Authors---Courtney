The display can have sense regions for sensing a touch or near touch on the display during the touch mode. These same regions can display graphics or data on the display during the display mode. During display mode, the data lines in the sense regions can be configured to couple to display circuitry in order to receive data signals from the circuitry for displaying. During touch mode, the data lines in the sense regions can be configured to couple to corresponding sense lines in the regions, which in turn can couple to touch circuitry, in order to transmit touch signals to the circuitry for sensing a touch or near touch. Alternatively, during touch mode, the data lines in the sense regions can be configured to couple to ground in order to transmit residual data signals to ground for discarding.

The dry oxidation reduces or eliminates the formation of Kooi ribbons, and the high temperature field oxidation allows the field oxide to flow, thereby reducing physical stresses normally associated with field oxidation performed at temperatures below 1000°C. The high temperature field oxidation also greatly reduces the ratio of the length of the bird's beaks formed during the field oxidation to the thickness of the field oxide, allowing smaller active regions to be formed. The thinner field oxide regions, in turn, make it possible to perform the field implant after the field oxidation, thereby avoiding the lateral encroachment problem and controlling source to drain or drain to source punch-through under the gate.

The coupled CFD and kinetic computer code are used in combination with data obtained from a matrix of experimental tests to extract the kinetic constants. Local fluid dynamic effects are implicitly included in the extracted local kinetic constants for each particular application system to which the methodology is applied. The extracted local kinetic model constants work well over a fairly broad range of operating conditions for specific and complex reaction sets in specific and complex reactor systems. While disclosed in terms of use in a Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) riser, the inventive methodology has application in virtually any reaction set to extract constants for any particular application and reaction set formulation. The methodology includes the step of: (1) selecting the test data sets for various conditions; (2) establishing the general trend of the parametric effect on the measured product yields; (3) calculating product yields for the selected test conditions using coupled computational fluid dynamics and chemical kinetics; (4) adjusting the local kinetic constants to match calculated product yields with experimental data; and (5) validating the determined set of local kinetic constants by comparing the calculated results with experimental data from additional test runs at different operating conditions.",UNIV CHICAGO,CHANG SHEN-LIN;;LOTTES STEVEN A;;ZHOU CHENN Q,U CHICAGO ARGONNE LLC (2006-09-25);;UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO THE (1997-11-07),https://lens.org/192-458-430-603-424,Granted Patent,yes,6,22,1,1,0,B01J19/0006;;B01J2219/00193;;B01J2219/00218;;B01J2219/00227;;C10G11/187;;Y10S208/01;;B01J19/0006;;B01J2219/00218;;C10G11/187;;B01J2219/00227;;B01J2219/00193;;Y10S208/01,B01J19/00;;C10G11/18,208/113;;208/164;;X208DIG  1;;364/578;;364/528.01;;364/528.07,3,0,,,"Manuscript entitled A Sectional Coupling Approach for the Simulation of Multi Phase Reacting Flow in A Bent Reactor, written by S.L.

C. The dry oxidation reduces or eliminates the formation of Kooi ribbons, and the high temperature field oxidation allows the field oxide to flow, thereby reducing physical stresses normally associated with field oxidation performed at temperatures below 1000.degree. C. The high temperature field oxidation also greatly reduces the ratio of the length of the bird's beaks formed during the field oxidation to the thickness of the field oxide, allowing smaller active regions to be formed. The thinner field oxide regions, in turn, make it possible to perform the field implant after the field oxidation, thereby avoiding the lateral encroachment problem and controlling source to drain or drain to source punch-through under the gate.

Airborne particles are drawn into the instrument, and detected using optical methods such as light scattering or laser-induced fluorescence. When a particle of interest is detected, a charged droplet of the analysis liquid (CDAL) is ejected so that it collides with the detected particle and moves into a horizontally oriented linear quadrupole that is in an airtight container, except for small orifices to let the CDAL enter and exit. The CDAL is levitated in a high humidity environment so that it evaporates slowly, so that there is time for the reaction between the analyte, if any, and the CDAL can take place, and so that the optical property, typically fluorescence, can be measured. The amount of the analyte in the particle is determined from the measured fluorescence or other optical property.

The APA uses an analysis liquid. In most embodiments, this analysis liquid is chosen so that when it is mixed with the particles, an optical property of the analysis liquid (AL) varies according to the amount of the analyte in the particles. Airborne particles are drawn into the instrument, and detected using optical methods such as light scattering or laser-induced fluorescence. When a particle of interest is detected, a charged droplet of the analysis liquid (CDAL) is ejected so that it collides with the detected particle and moves into a horizontally oriented linear quadrupole that is in an airtight container, except for small orifices to let the CDAL enter and exit. The CDAL is levitated in a high humidity environment so that it evaporates slowly, so that there is time for the reaction between the analyte, if any, and the CDAL can take place, and so that the optical property, typically fluorescence, can be measured. The amount of the analyte in the particle is determined from the measured fluorescence or other optical property. The particles collected into the CDAL can be sent on to other instruments for further analysis, especially to instruments that can analyze such small samples.",HILL STEVEN C;;CHANG RICHARD K;;WOLF JEAN-PIERRE,HILL STEVEN C;;CHANG RICHARD K;;WOLF JEAN-PIERRE,USA AS REPRESENTED BY THE SECRETARY OF THE ARMY (2005-05-09),https://lens.org/029-933-338-096-757,Patent Application,yes,1,6,2,2,0,G01N15/1459;;G01N2015/1481;;Y10T436/25875;;G01N15/1492;;Y10T436/25875;;G01N15/1459;;G01N2015/1481,G01N33/53;;B32B27/04,435/7.1;;422/82.05,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

Each test configuration corresponds to the locations of probes within the fixture as a particular test is performed. In a first pass of the algorithm, for each test configuration, every other test configuration is considered as a next move candidate for which a weighted distance is calculated from the test configuration. Weighting factors reflect the degree of difficulty in moving one direction instead of another. A need to move one probe before another or to move in one direction before another, in order to prevent a collision within the test fixture, is also considered. A predetermined number of next move candidates having the lowest weighted distances are placed in an intermediate list for the test configuration. In a second pass of the algorithm, test configurations are linked, one to another, to form a list reflecting a preferred order of probe movement. In the process of linking with a test configuration, the available next move candidate having the shortest weighted distance is chosen from the intermediate list of the test configuration. If no available next move candidates remain in the intermediate list, the process returns to the first pass of the algorithm to get more next move candidates.

   the present invention is a purified cartilage extract that stimulates local cartilage formation when combined with a matrix and implanted into a mammal. This extract can conveniently be produced by a method which includes the steps of: obtaining cartilage tissue; homogenizing the cartilage tissue in the presence of chaotropic agents under conditions that permit separation of proteins from proteoglycans; separating the proteins from the proteoglycans and then obtaining the proteins. The step for separating the proteins from the proteoglycans can be carried out using a sepharose column. The extract can also be obtained by additionally including the steps of separating the proteins on a molecular sieve and then collecting the proteins having molecular weights in the 30 kDa to 60 kDa size range. Articular cartilage or epiphyseal cartilage can be used in the preparation of this purified extract.

Alignment patterns are designed and manufactured on both a membrane prober and a wafer under test. The patterns are properly designed for acquiring a first set of measurement data that provide relative position information when the prober contacts the wafer. A second set of measurement data can be obtained by a controlled move between the prober and the wafer. The relative position including the translation offset and the rotation angle can be computed by the information derived from the two sets of measurement data. The second set of measurement data may also be acquired by having two alignment pattern pairs that are made to contact in a single touch. More accurate alignment can be achieved by using more pairs of alignment patterns.,IND TECH RES INST,YANG STEVEN J R;;CHANG JANE HUEI-CHEN;;CHANG CHUNG-TAO;;LEE HSIU-TSANG,INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH INSTITUTE (1997-10-13),https://lens.org/163-364-524-095-580,Granted Patent,yes,4,5,2,2,0,G01R31/2863;;G01R31/2865;;G01R31/2863;;G01R31/2865,G01R31/28,324/758;;324/765,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In order to use the clock to process the data, the clock signal must be extracted from the data signal. Because the data and clock may travel through different circuit paths they may have different propagation delays and a phase offset between the clock and data may result. Data and clock phase offsets are more problematical as data transmission speed increases. Furthermore the data/phase offset is typically not constant and may change with a variety of variables. To compensate for the changing offset, one or more variable delays (1113) are inserted in the phase detector circuitry. The timing of the variable delay is controlled by a bang-bang phase detector (1105), such as an Alexander phase detector, which determines if the clock is leading, lagging, or in phase with the data. The delay control loops are low bandwidth, because the phase offset generally changes slowly, and because the loops should not respond to temporary upsets such as noise spikes. The delay control loops integrate the output of the bang-bang phase detector and use the output to control a decimated up down counter (1113), which is then further used to control one or more variable delays. The counter (1113) can be pre-loaded with a default start point, and the bandwidth of the loops can be dynamically adjusted by changing the decimation ratio and sample periods of the loop.",CONEXANT SYSTEMS INC,CHANG CHARLES;;ZHANG BO;;LAO ZHIHAO;;BECCUE STEVEN;;PETERSON ANDERS,,https://lens.org/117-574-285-522-174,Patent Application,yes,5,10,3,3,0,H03L7/089;;H03L7/089;;H03L7/07;;H03L7/07;;H03L7/087;;H03L7/087;;H04L7/033;;H04L7/033;;H04L7/0331;;H04L7/0331,H03L7/07;;H03L7/081;;H03L7/087;;H03L7/089;;H04L7/033,,0,0,,,,PENDING

   Disclosed is a design methodology which facilitates increasing the system mode frequency of an actuator system. As a first step, the primary components of a given actuator system are analyzed to determine which component is most responsible for limiting the system mode frequency of the given system. That component is then stiffened, resulting in a new actuator system with a higher system mode frequency. A second analysis step may then be performed to determine whether the modified design is optimal. These steps may be repeated as parts of an iterative process resulting in an optimal actuator design.

The serial arrangement of the TWC and the ammonia-SCR catalyst enhances the conversion of NO X to N 2 in the low oxygen-content exhaust flow produced by the engine and helps prevent ammonia slip to the atmosphere.",QI GONGSHIN;;KIM CHANG H;;LI WEI;;SCHMIEG STEVEN J;;GM GLOBAL TECH OPERATIONS INC,QI GONGSHIN;;KIM CHANG H;;LI WEI;;SCHMIEG STEVEN J,GM GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS LLC (2010-12-07),https://lens.org/173-703-140-973-299,Patent Application,yes,15,13,6,6,0,B01D53/9431;;B01D53/9454;;B01D53/9495;;B01D2255/1021;;B01D2255/1023;;B01D2255/1025;;B01D2255/20738;;B01D2255/20761;;B01D2255/407;;B01D2255/50;;B01D2255/908;;F01N3/0864;;F01N3/101;;F01N3/2073;;F01N3/2803;;F01N2340/02;;F01N2430/06;;F01N2510/063;;F01N2560/025;;F01N2900/08;;F01N13/0093;;F01N13/009;;Y02T10/12;;B01D53/9454;;B01D2255/1021;;B01D2255/1025;;B01D2255/407;;B01D2255/908;;B01D2255/20738;;B01D2255/20761;;B01D2255/1023;;B01D53/9495;;B01D2255/50;;B01D53/9431;;F01N2560/025;;F01N3/101;;F01N3/2073;;F01N2430/06;;F01N3/0864;;F01N2510/063;;F01N2340/02;;F01N3/2803;;F01N2900/08;;F01N13/0093;;F01N13/009;;Y02T10/12,F01N3/18;;F01N3/10,60/274;;60/299,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

In order to use the clock to process the data, the clock signal must be extracted from the data signal. Because the data and clock may travel through different circuit paths they may have different propagation delays and a phase offset between the clock and data may result. Data and clock phase offsets are more problematical as data transmission speed increases. Furthermore the data/phase offset is typically not constant and may change with a variety of variables. To compensate for the changing offset, one or more variable delays are inserted in the phase detector circuitry. The timing of the variable delay is controlled by a bang-bang phase detector, such as an Alexander phase detector, which determines if the clock is leading, lagging, or in phase with the data. The delay control loops are low bandwidth, because the phase offset generally changes slowly, and because the loops should not respond to temporary upsets such as noise spikes. The delay control loops integrate the output of the bang-bang phase detector and use the output to control a decimated up down counter, which is then further used to control one or more variable delays. The counter can be pre-loaded with a default start point, and the bandwidth of the loops can be dynamically adjusted by changing the decimation ratio and sample periods of the loop.",CONEXANT SYSTEMS INC,CHANG CHARLES;;ZHANG BO;;LAO ZHIHAO;;BECCUE STEVEN;;PETERSEN ANDERS K,MINDSPEED TECHNOLOGIES (2003-06-27);;MACOM TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS HOLDINGS INC (2015-12-10);;CONEXANT SYSTEMS INC (2000-12-22),https://lens.org/093-477-651-960-630,Granted Patent,yes,11,45,3,3,0,H03L7/089;;H03L7/089;;H03L7/07;;H03L7/07;;H03L7/087;;H03L7/087;;H04L7/033;;H04L7/033;;H04L7/0331;;H04L7/0331,H03L7/07;;H03L7/081;;H03L7/087;;H03L7/089;;H04L7/033,327/2;;327/12,4,4,012-914-464-706-025;;031-083-396-881-255;;136-642-978-572-239;;107-154-849-928-177,10.1109/4.340431;;10.1049/el:19750415;;10.1109/4.173100;;10.1109/9780470545331,"B.

    The present invention relates to a process for preparing a single crystal silicon ingot, as well as to the ingot or wafer resulting therefrom. The process comprises controlling (i) a growth velocity, v, (ii) an average axial temperature gradient, G ₀ , and (iii) a cooling rate of the crystal from solidification to about 750 C., in order to cause the formation of a segment having a first axially symmetric region extending radially inward from the lateral surface of the ingot wherein silicon self-interstitials are the predominant intrinsic point defect, and a second axially symmetric region extending radially inward from the first and toward the central axis of the ingot. The process is characterized in that v, G ₀ and the cooling rate are controlled to prevent the formation of agglomerated intrinsic point defects in the first region, while the cooling rate is further controlled to limit the formation of oxidation induced stacking faults in a wafer derived from this segment, upon subjecting the wafer to an oxidation treatment otherwise suitable for the formation of such faults.

The process is characterised in that v, G and the cooling rate are controlled to prevent the formation of agglomerated intrinsic point defects in the first region, while the cooling rate is further controlled to limit the formation of oxidation induced stacking faults in a wafer derived from this segment, upon subjecting the wafer to an oxidation treatment otherwise suitable for the formation of such faults.",MEMC ELECTRONIC MATERIALS,KIM CHANG BUM;;KIMBEL STEVEN L;;LIBBERT JEFFREY L;;BANAN MOHSEN,,https://lens.org/100-865-944-179-828,Search Report,yes,2,0,26,26,0,C30B15/20;;C30B15/203;;C30B15/206;;C30B29/06;;Y10T428/21;;C30B15/00;;Y10T428/21;;C30B15/203;;C30B15/206;;C30B29/06;;C30B15/20,C30B15/00;;C30B15/20;;C30B29/06;;C30B33/02,,2,0,,,"PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN vol. 1999, no. 05 31 May 1999 (1999-05-31);;PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN vol. 1999, no. 05 31 May 1999 (1999-05-31)",DISCONTINUED

   A Fluorescence Particle Spectrometer (FPS) performs real-time measurement of the fluorescence spectra of aerosol particles in the size range 1-10 m diameter. The FPS has a sufficiently high sample rate (estimated to be a few liters/min) to measure aerosol within buildings (from 1 up to 600 particle fluorescence spectra per minute) at practical rates. A virtual impactor first concentrates aerosol particles, which are then drawn under negative pressure through an aerodynamic focusing nozzle in the inlet of the instrument, through the sample region, providing further concentration. The rate of particle spectra measured by the FPS increases significantly when the particle inlet is within a few meters of some common sources of indoor biological particles.

    Multiple beam electron beam lithography uses an array of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELS) to generate laser beams, which are then converted to electron beams using a photocathode. The electron beams are scanned across a semiconductor substrate or lithography mask to imprint a pattern thereon. The use of VCSELs simplifies the design of the electron beam column and improves the throughput and writing resolution of the lithography system.
