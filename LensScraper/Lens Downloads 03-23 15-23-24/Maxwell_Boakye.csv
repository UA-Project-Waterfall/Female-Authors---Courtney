A 3D model of the spinal cord is used to determine an initial position for an electrode array to deliver stimulation. Spinal cord electrical stimulation is configurable to target different physiological functions with surgical implantation of the neurostimulator at a singular location. Such systems and methods include (i) anatomical specificity to target the appropriate region of the spinal cord for stimulation, (ii) electrical specificity to provide the appropriate stimulation by delivery method, frequency, pulse duration, and other factors, and (iii) physiological specificity to evoke, suppress, increase, or decrease a specific physiological result.",UNIV LOUISVILLE RES FOUND INC,ANGELI CLAUDIA;;HUBSCHER CHARLES;;FORREST GAIL F;;REJC ENRICO;;HARKEMA SUSAN J;;BOAKYE MAXWELL;;GERASIMENKO YURY,THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY (2024-02-01),https://lens.org/091-439-495-252-623,Patent Application,yes,0,0,1,1,0,A61N1/36062;;A61N1/36139;;A61N1/36071;;A61N1/0551;;A61N1/0553;;A61N1/36185;;A61N1/36062;;A61N1/36139;;A61B5/388,A61N1/36;;A61B5/388,,0,0,,,,PENDING
