In one example approach, during placement of a deep brain stimulating electrode in a target region of the brain of a patient, a temperature of brown adipose tissue (BAT) may be monitored, e.g., via a supraclavicular temperature sensor implanted in the patient, and used to identify an optimal location of electrode stimulation which causes an increase in BAT temperature. Additionally, BAT temperature measurements may be used to provide regulated closed-loop control to increase efficiency of DBS while reducing energy consumption of the pulse generator. Further, core temperature measurements may be obtained from the electrode in the brain and used to adjust DBS.",UNIV OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE,BURCHIEL KIM;;MADDEN CHRISTOPHER J;;MORRISON SHAUN F,,https://lens.org/049-505-178-686-575,Patent Application,yes,2,0,14,16,0,A61N1/0534;;A61N1/0534;;A61B5/01;;A61B5/4836;;A61B5/4836;;A61B2562/0271;;A61B2562/0271;;A61N1/36085;;A61N1/36085;;A61N1/36117;;A61N1/36117;;A61N1/36139;;A61N1/36139,A61N1/05;;A61B5/00;;A61B5/01;;A61N1/36,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
