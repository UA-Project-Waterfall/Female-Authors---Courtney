Buchanan, R. Sept. 3. Roller mills. - Break-roll products are separated by means of two inclined and verticallyreciprocated sieves arranged one below the other, the upper one being meshed so as to pass through it the semolinas and smaller particles and to tail off the coarse material requiring further breaking, and the lower one being meshed so as to tail over the semolinas and the like and pass through it the middlings and flour. The apparatus, which is shown in com, bination with a double-break machine, is a modification of that described in Specification 27,612/08, sieves J, J' being arranged beneath and parallel to the vertically-reciprocated sieves C, C<1>. The inclined sieves are removably mounted in end frames D reciprocated in vertical guides E by a cam F, and the chop from the rolls B is discharged against curtains K and rebounds against plates L, which guide it to the upper parts of the upper sieves C, C<1>. The coarse material, semolina, and middlings &c. separated by the sieves are received in compartments N, 0, P respectively, flexible connexions M being provided between the lower edges of the sieves and the partitions. The semolina and tailings of the lower sieves J, J' received in the compartments O are led direct to a purifier, which may be of the type described in Specification 1317/07, [Class 117, Sifting &c.].

The input ventilation openings are coupled to a plenum chamber and the exhaust ventilation openings are coupled to an exhaust chamber. Air flow is maintained from the plenum chamber through the enclosures and out the exhaust chamber by a pressure differential between the plenum chamber and the exhaust chamber. This is accomplished by maintaining the plenum chamber at a positive pressure with respect to the enclosures and maintaining the exhaust chamber at a negative pressure with respect to the enclosures. Air is not recirculated through the cages, and both the input and the exhaust air is sterilized by various devices in the path of the ventilation stream. Cleaning of the enclosures is accomplished by flushing any waste material into the pathway coupling the enclosures with the exhaust chamber. The use of the transparent panels enables various murals to be positioned to give the people who are viewing the animals a feeling of being in a more natural environment.

Tire casings cut in this way are then fanned open and attached to one of two types of bases.

Penetrating X-ray radiation is transmitted through the objects (10, 11, 12, . . . ) to cause an image to be formed for each object in succession by an electronic imaging system (40). The imaging system (40) generates digital signals representative of the image for each object, and transmits the digital signals to a data processor/comparator (50). One of the objects (10, 11, 12, . . . ) may be considered as a reference object against which the other objects are compared for structural homogeneity. Thus, the electronic images of the objects (11, 12, . . . ) could be compared with the electronic image of, for example, the object (10). Alternatively, the electronic images of the test objects could be compared with an electronic reference image programmed into the data processor/comparator (50), the programmed reference image. The comparison performed by the data processor/comparator (50) is a subtraction process, which eliminates background features common to test and reference images. Thus, any flaw appearing in a test image, but not present in the reference image, stands out in sharp detail. When a flaw occurs in a test image, the subtractive process results in a non-null signal, which activates a conveyor control mechanism (70) for stopping the conveyor (20) so as to enable rejection of the flawed test object.",LOCKHEED MISSILES SPACE,BUCHANAN ROBERT A,LOCKHEED MISSILES & SPACE COMPANY INC (1981-02-17);;LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION (1996-01-25);;LOCKHEED CORPORATION (1996-01-25),https://lens.org/106-986-947-737-038,Granted Patent,yes,8,67,2,2,0,G01N23/18;;G06T7/001;;G06T2207/10116;;G06T2207/20224;;G06T2207/30164;;G01N23/083;;G01N23/18;;G06T2207/30164;;G06T2207/20224;;G06T7/001;;G06T2207/10116;;G01N23/083,G01N23/18;;G06T7/00,378/58;;358/111;;364/414;;378/99;;378/4;;378/21,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

For weight transfer the upper link 2 is connected to the tractor at 34 and a pressure fluid connection 21 is opened between a piston and cylinder 26, 24 operating on the end of the control rod 9 and a valve unit 22. When the manually operable piston 27 is in the position shown the cylinder 24 is in communication with the operating ram 3 and the source of fluid pressure through conduit 23 so that variations in pressure in the operating ram 3 are transmitted through piston 26 to operate the control rod 9 which, in turn, operates the control valve to adjust the supply of fluid to the ram to keep the pressure therein, and therefore the transfer of weight from implement to tractor, substantially constant.

Springs; tractor power lift mechanisms. MASSEY-FERGUSON PERKINS Ltd. 13 April, 1966 [20 April, 1965], No.16460/65. Heading A1P. [Also in Division F2] A single or double acting-control spring unit 10 in a feedback control system of a hydraulic power lift on a tractor is provided with a compressing attachment spring 20 which, in the case of a single acting-control spring, effectively converts it to a double acting-spring and, in the case of a double acting-spring, can be used to precompress the control spring when heavy implements are carried by the power lift. The attachment spring 20 comprises a plate having a pair of legs 21 for pivotal mounting, on studs 22, to a rear extension 15 of the control spring housing 10, and a pair of curved spring tongues 25 the free ends of which bear against a rocker arm 16 which is pivoted on the studs 22 and to the outer end of a rod 14 of the control spring 10, the latter pivot also serving as a pivotal connection between the rod 14 and the control link of a tractor hitch linkage connected to the implement. Means for adjusting the force applied to the control spring 10 by the tongues 25 comprises a bolt 23 which is screwed in an aperture in the spring 20 and has a head which abuts against the housing 10, a nut 26 on the bolt serving as adjustment means. As shown the control spring is double acting and is constrained between a sleeve 13 connected to the rod 14 and a sleeve 12 which is carried by a head 17 on the inner end of the rod 14 the head 17 engaging a control linkage connected to tractor hydraulic system. The attachment spring 20 could act directly upon a pin carried by the rod 14 the rocker arm 16 being omitted.

The fish ladder comprises a series of dish-like compartments to which water is made to flow from top to bottom. Auxiliary water input to each dish in the series is maintained to create the desired turbulence and flush debris from the ladder. Also included is a power predator seine chamber at the bottom of the fish ladder for chumming predator fish from the waters at the bottom of the fish ladder. The predator fish can be sorted out when the seine is raised. Repetitive traveling screens move through the water and allow the removal of water from a body of water without removing or damaging fish therein. The screen's rotation, size of the screen material, and the angle of the screen to primary water flow allow the migrating fish to keep moving in the desired direction while large volumes of water are diverted. Another component of the system is a multi-point discharger for providing water discharge from a dam or the like. The discharger includes a large pipe with numerous small openings for discharging the water as a multitude of small streams of water. The resulting discharge eliminates the confusion in upstream migrants which results from present water discharge systems. The upstream migrating fish are thus more quickly and easily able to find the fish ladder. Also, an optional fish return is provided for those situations where two rivers having migrating fish therein are coupled together by a canal.",BUCHANAN ROBERT R,BUCHANAN ROBERT R,,https://lens.org/119-583-953-813-987,Granted Patent,yes,5,47,1,1,0,E02B8/085;;Y02A40/60;;A01K79/00;;A01K61/00;;Y02A40/81;;A01K61/10;;A01K61/95;;E02B8/085;;Y02A40/60;;A01K79/00,A01K61/00;;E02B8/08,405/82,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Johnson, F., and Buchanan, R. March 31. Governing or controlling pumps. -Relates to a method of automatically stopping and re-starting pumps which are used for charging hydraulic accumulators. Fig. 1 shows a side elevation and Fig. 31a plan of the arrangement, in which Y is part of the accumulator, J a fork which guides the driving-strap of the pump from, or on to, the loose or fast pulleys as desired, A, B two pulleys mounted on the same shaft, A being keyed to it while B runs loose, and both having two wire or other suitable ropes attached to them. Keyed to the same shaft is a boss which has a weighted arm R and a projection S, the latter being connected to a spring V which steadies the motion of the arm R. As the accumu. lator is charged by the pumps, the part Y slowly rises, and the projecting pulley Z pulls on the rope F, rotating the pulley A and throwing the weighted arm R over. The projection S catches against one of the pegs P, Q on the wheel B, thus quickly rotating it sufficiently to actuate the lever M, so as to throw the pump strap on to the loose pulley. As the accumulator becomes discharged, the port Y sinks, so that another projection Z' reverses the previous motions and throws the pumps into operation. Fig. 4 shows a modification in which the pulley A is operated by the unequal weights F<1>, G<1>. In the upward movement of the part Y of the accumulator, the weight F is raised, and the weight G<1 >reverses the mechanism. Upon the descent of the part Y, the weight F<1> draws the weight G<1> up and throws the arm R over, which again throws the pumps into action.",JOHNSON FRANCIS;;BUCHANAN ROBERT,JOHNSON FRANCIS;;BUCHANAN ROBERT,,https://lens.org/086-182-341-211-384,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

In operation the piston valve is set to the neutral position shown, by manual movement of screw 20. With an increase or decrease in pressure in the ram, due to undulations in the ground, the fluid operating through port 27 raises or lowers the pressure in chamber 28 to move the piston valve so that pressure fluid is either withdrawn or supplied to the ram in which the pressure is thus kept substantially constant to effect a constant weight transfer.",MASSEY FERGUSON PERKINS LTD,ANNAT ROBERT BUCHANAN;;METCALFE EDWARD GEOFFREY,,https://lens.org/076-598-897-692-271,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,3,0,A01D41/145;;A01D41/145;;A01D41/141;;A01D41/141,A01D41/14,A1F FH11          FH11;;A1F FJA           FJA;;A1F F6A           -;;A1F F6C           -;;A1F F6G           -;;A1F F6J4          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The scale plates are formed with mirror image windows struck on the arc of movement of the vane that are calibrated to directly read air flow velocity in proportion to the vane deflection about its pivot axis. The housing end plates are formed with cooperating ports for housing a level bubble vial for leveling the gauge; the housing side plates are also formed to define fastener receiving sleeves for mounting the gauge in use. * - Trade Mark",DWYER INSTR,BUCHANAN STEVEN O;;BUTTS ROBERT W,,https://lens.org/002-078-871-546-408,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,5,0,,G01P5/04,73-132,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A U-shaped hitch shown in plan in Fig. 2 is connected by pins 23, 24 and brackets 25, 26 to the lower draft links 14 of a three point power lift linkage, and a stowable boom 18 pivotally mounted on a forwardly inclined but nearly vertical pin 28 is connected by a chain 19 to the pivotally connected but rigid draw bars 12, 13. Weight transferred from the vehicle or implement 11 as on turning a corner is automatically maintained constant by the power lift mechanism. The brackets 25, 26, Figs. 2 and 4, have recesses 31, 32 which may be adjusted in size to accommodate different links by removing plates 33 and rebolting them to partly cover the recesses, lugs 35, 36 may be secured together when the boom is not in use. The U-shaped hitch may however, be replaced by a support of any convenient form. In Figs. 5 and 6 (not shown), the chain 19 is releasably attached to the boom by a ball (40) normally held in a recess (37) by a spring (41). If the connection between the bars 12 and 13 breaks then (40) and the chain 19 are released by rearing of the tractor. In Figs. 7 and 8 (not shown) the chain may slip out of the recess (37) when it reaches a pre-determined angle or be forced out by an abutment (38) engaging a pin (39).

Il est préférable que le gaz de référence dans l'outil soit mis à l'air libre avant que ladite colonne n'arrive à la tête du puits. Il serait également avantageux d'incorporer dans la colonne des moyens d'isolement de la partie supérieure du tube de production , ainsi qu'un chemin de communication entre ledit tube et l'espace annulaire de manière à retirer le liquide du puits contenu dans le tube au-dessus du niveau de la colonne d'essai avant que le tube ne soit amené à la surface. L'invention prévoit un appareil pour lesdites opérations de mise à l'air et d'isolement, qui permet de les effectuer sous forme de séquence automatique, suivant l'application d'une seule impulsion de pression envoyée à l'espace annulaire. L'invention propose, afin de dégager le gaz de référence, un appareil de dépressurisation muni de deux pistons espacés (7, 11) situés aux extrémités opposées d'une chambre (10) qui est remplie dudit gaz et qui bloque un évent de gaz (17) dans l'espace annulaire, ainsi qu'un passage pour un liquide hydraulique (22: vers la partie supérieure de la colonne d'essai). Lesdits pistons sont reliés par une goupille frangible (13) jusqu'à ce que l'application d'une pression prédéterminée (plus élevée que la pression du gaz de référence) aux extrémités externes des pistons provoque le cisaillement de la goupille, permettant ainsi le déplacement consécutif des deux pistons l'un vers l'autre, et effectuant l'ouverture de l'évent de gaz vers l'espace annulaire et du passage (22) vers la chambre (24) de liquide hydraulique. La pression du liquide hydraulique dans ledit passage actionne ensuite le robinet à tournant shpérique afin de réaliser l'isolement de la partie supérieure du tube de production.

It is desirable for the high pressure reference gas in the tool to be vented before the string reaches the well head. It is also an advantage if there be incorporated w ithin the test string some means of isolating the upper portion of the tubing thereof, and of subsequently providing a route for communi cation between this tubing and the annulus, so that tubing-contained well liquid above the test string can then be circulate d out of the tubing before it is raised to the surface. The invention provides apparatus for the venting and isolation procedures just d escribed, this apparatus permitting those operations to be carried out as an automatic sequence, following the application of a singl e actuating pressure pulse to the annulus. For the venting of the reference gas, the invention suggests pressure release appara tus having two spaced pistons (7, 11) located at opposite ends of a chamber (10) filled with that gas and blocking both a gas vent (17) to annulus and a hydraulic liquid passageway (22: to further up the test string), the pistons being held together by a shear pin (13) until the application of a predetermined pressure (higher than the gas reference pressure) at the outside ends of those pistons ca uses the pin to shear, allowing sequential movement of the two pistons towards each other, with the effect of firstly openi ng the gas vent to annulus, and secondly opening the passageway (22) to a chamber (24) of hydraulic liquid. The hydraulic liquid pressure within this passageway then causes actuation of ball valve apparatus for isolating the upper section of tubing. This apparatu s is in the form of a ball-valve-driving piston (39) blocking another passageway (40) for hydraulic liquid, which piston is: for ced to move under the influence of the pressure, breaking a restraining shear pin (44) as it does so, and closing the ball valve while opening this other hydraulic liquid passageway, permitting transfer of hydraulic pressure to apparatus for venting the contents of the tubing to annulus. Finally, this venting apparatus contains a longitudinally-movable sleeve member (54) the position of w hich determines whether or not flow is permitted, via vent ports (55, 56), from the test string tubing to the annulus.",,EDWARDS JEFFREY CHARLES;;JOHNS RAY;;BUCHANAN ROBERT DONALD,,https://lens.org/053-925-447-632-133,Granted Patent,no,0,0,15,15,0,E21B34/103;;E21B34/103,E21B/;;E21B34/06;;E21B34/10;;E21B49/08,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

SOLUTION: This method controls a polar coordinates stage and moves an object against an image processing system. It turns the image of the object while moving the object and compensates the turning of the object. Then, the direction of a structure in the image is held, and confusion experienced by an operator while the object is moved is reduced by eliminating clear turning in the image. The moving angular velocity is controlled so as to be independent of the radial direction position of a point where an image shift speed is visually recognized. The device area needed by the stage is reduced and pre-alignment is made easy by using a polar coordinates stage 320. In detail, an edge detecting part 360 measures an object position while the stage 320 turns the object.

Un moyen permettant de contrôler le fonctionnement des divers outils compris dans la colonne d'essai est de faire varier la pression différentielle entre le tube de production et l'espace annulaire qui l'entoure dans le puits. Un élément essentiel de la colonne devant être contrôlé de cette manière est la soupape de contrôle située sous la surface, qui peut être un robinet à tournant sphérique. Cependant, lorsque la pression du liquide agissant sur le côté en amont dudit robinet est très élevée, un problème se pose: les forces de frottement suscitées par la pression du tournant contre le logement de son côté en aval peuvent être si élevées que le tournant se coince. L'invention propose d'éviter ce coincement en permettant l'application de la force d'entraînement au tournant par l'intermédiaire d'un multiplicateur de force de filetage différentielle. Un autre problème se pose lorsqu'on utilise un robinet à fermeture par système de rappel: il sera peut être nécessaire de maintenir, pendant des périodes prolongées, la pression annulaire qui maintient la soupape en position ouverte. Selon l'invention, on résout ce problème en prévoyant des moyens de verrouillage permettant de retenir le manchon d'actionnement du robinet dans la position ouverte même lorsque la pression annulaire est retirée, une première impulsion de la pression annulaire effectuant l'ouverture de la soupape. Pendant la détente, la soupape est bloquée dans la position d'ouverture, une seconde impulsion de pression annulaire la débloquant ensuite, ce qui permet à la soupape de se refermer à la fin de l'impulsion.",EXPLORATION & PROD SERV,EDWARDS JEFFREY CHARLES;;JOHNS RAY;;BUCHANAN ROBERT DONALD,EXPRO NORTH SEA LIMITED (1996-02-01),https://lens.org/081-468-293-020-779,Patent Application,yes,0,0,18,18,0,E21B23/006;;E21B23/006;;E21B23/004;;E21B23/004;;E21B34/10;;E21B34/10;;E21B34/102;;E21B34/102;;E21B2200/04;;E21B2200/04;;F16K5/0652;;F16K5/0652,E21B23/00;;E21B34/00;;E21B34/10;;F16K5/06,,1,0,,,See references of WO 9013764A3,EXPIRED

It is desirable for the high pressure reference gas in the tool to be vented before the string reaches the well head. It is also an advantage if there be incorporated within the test string some means of isolating the upper portion of the tubing thereof, and of subsequently providing a route for communication between this tubing and the annulus, so that tubing-contained well liquid above the test string can then be circulated out of the tubing before it is raised to the surface. The invention provides apparatus for the venting and isolation procedures just described, this apparatus permitting those operations to be carried out as an automatic sequence, following the application of a single actuating pressure pulse to the annulus. For the venting of the reference gas, the invention suggests pressure release apparatus having two spaced pistons (7, 11) located at opposite ends of a chamber (10) filled with that gas and blocking both a gas vent (17) to annulus and a hydraulic liquid passageway (22: to further up the test string), the pistons being held together by a shear pin (13) until the application of a predetermined pressure (higher than the gas reference pressure) at the outside ends of those pistons causes the pin to shear, allowing sequential movement of the two pistons towards each other, with the effect of firstly opening the gas vent to annulus, and secondly opening the passageway (22) to a chamber (24) of hydraulic liquid. The hydraulic liquid pressure within this passageway then causes actuation of ball valve apparatus for isolating the upper section of tubing. This apparatus is in the form of a ball-valve-driving piston (39) blocking another passageway (40) for hydraulic liquid, which piston is forced to move under the influence of the pressure, breaking a restraining shear pin (44) as it does so, and closing the ball valve while opening this other hydraulic liquid passageway, permitting transfer of hydraulic pressure to apparatus for venting the contents of the tubing to annulus. Finally, this venting apparatus contains a longitudinally-movable sleeve member (54) the position of which determines whether or not flow is permitted, via vent ports (55, 56), from the test string tubing to the annulus.",EXPLORATION & PROD SERV,EDWARDS JEFFREY CHARLES;;JOHNS RAY;;BUCHANAN ROBERT DONALD,,https://lens.org/113-488-624-095-095,Patent Application,yes,0,9,15,15,0,E21B34/103;;E21B34/103,E21B/;;E21B34/06;;E21B34/10;;E21B49/08,,0,0,,,,PATENTED

One way of controlling the operation of the various tools included in the test string is by changes in the pressure differential between the tubing and the annular space which surrounds it in the well, and an essential component of the test string to be controlled in this way is the sub-surface control valve, which may conveniently be a ball valve. However, a problem is experienced where the pressure of fluid acting on the upstream side of the ball is very high; the frictional forces caused by the ball being pressed up against the seating on its downstream side may be so high as to make the ball stick. The invention seeks to avoid this by enabling the actuating force to be applied to the ball, via a differential thread force multiplier. Another problem experienced when employing a biased-closed valve is that the annulus pressure needed to keep the valve open may have to be maintained for extended periods. The invention solves this one by providing latch means whereby the valve actuating sleeve may be retained in the valve-open position even when the applied annulus pressure is removed, a first pulse of applied annulus pressure causing the valve to open and then, as the pressure is removed, become latched in the open state, and thereafter a second pulse of applied annulus pressure unlatching the valve and allowing it to close once the pulse has ended.",EXPLORATION & PROD SERV,EDWARDS JEFFREY CHARLES;;JOHNS RAY;;BUCHANAN ROBERT DONALD,,https://lens.org/099-500-952-888-143,Patent Application,yes,0,3,18,18,0,E21B23/006;;E21B23/006;;E21B23/004;;E21B23/004;;E21B34/10;;E21B34/10;;E21B34/102;;E21B34/102;;E21B2200/04;;E21B2200/04;;F16K5/0652;;F16K5/0652,E21B23/00;;E21B34/00;;E21B34/10;;F16K5/06,,0,0,,,,PATENTED

One way of controlling the operation of the various tools included in the test string is by changes in the pressure differential between the tubing 113 and the annular space 114 which surrounds it in the well, and an essential component of the test string to be controlled in this way is the sub-surface control valve 118, which may conveniently be a ball valve. However, a problem is experienced when employing a biased-closed valve: the annulus pressure needed to keep the valve open may have to be maintained for extended periods. The invention solves this by providing latch means whereby the valve actuating sleeve may be retained in the valve-open position even when the applied annulus pressure is removed, a first pulse of applied annulus pressure causing the valve to open and then, as the pressure is removed, become latched in the open state, and thereafter a second pulse of applied annulus pressure unlatching the valve and allowing it to close once the pulse has ended. <IMAGE>",EXPLORATION & PROD SERV,JOHNS RAY;;EDWARDS JEFFREY CHARLES;;BUCHANAN ROBERT DONALD,,https://lens.org/167-243-772-838-827,Patent Application,no,2,2,18,18,0,E21B23/006;;E21B23/006;;E21B23/004;;E21B23/004;;E21B34/10;;E21B34/10;;E21B34/102;;E21B34/102;;E21B2200/04;;E21B2200/04;;F16K5/0652;;F16K5/0652,E21B23/00;;E21B34/00;;E21B34/10;;F16K5/06,E1F FLG           FLG;;E1F F301          FLG,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

One way of controlling the operation of the various tools included in the downhole test string, including the opening and closing of the downhole valve itself, is by changes in the pressure differential between the tubing and the annular space which surrounds it in the well, but this requires the provision and maintenance of a fixed 'reference' pressure within the tool, and a convenient such pressure is the hydrostatic (annulus) pressure experienced by the string after it has been lowered down the well bore and set into the packer. The invention proposes that reference pressure within the test string be trapped by a novel mechanism wherein a valve (4) drivable into a closed position by a first piston (3) open (at 5) to annulus pressure first defines, and then defines and closes, the open-to-tubing-pressure entrance (6) to a passageway (30, 19) leading to a reference-gas-containing chamber (22) via a second piston (20) therewithin. The invention also proposes a new mechanism by which compensation can be made for the effect of downhole temperature changes on the gas in a reference pressure chamber, in which mechanism there is a hydraulic-liquid-containing chamber (27) which is connected at one end, via a piston (25) thereat, to a vent (24) to annulus and at the other end to two 'one-way' passageways (28, 29) linking it to the reference-gas-containing chamber (22) via a chamber-contained second piston (23).",EXPLORATION & PROD SERV LTD,EDWARDS JEFFREY CHARLES;;JOHN RAY;;BUCHANAN ROBERT DONALD,,https://lens.org/148-716-663-204-41X,Patent Application,yes,0,14,17,17,0,E21B34/10;;E21B34/108;;E21B34/10;;E21B34/108,E21B34/10,,0,0,,,,PATENTED

While moving the object, the image of the object is rotated to compensate for rotation of the object. Accordingly, the orientations of features in the image are preserved, and removal of apparent rotation in the image reduces confusion an operator experiences while directing movement of the object. The angular velocity of the motion of the object is controlled so that image shift speed is independent of the radial position of the point being viewed. Use of a polar stage, reduces the required foot print for a stage and facilitates prealignment. In particular, an edge detector measures the position of the edge of the object while the polar coordinate stage rotates the object. A prealignment process determines the position and orientation of the object from the measured edge positions. A further alignment process uses automated pattern recognition which more easily identifies features on the object when the image is rotated so that the orientations of the feature are approximately known.",NANOMETRICS INC,BUCHANAN ROBERT;;YARUSSI RICHARD A;;SPADY BLAINE R,NANOMETRICS INCORPORATED (1999-07-08),https://lens.org/159-551-318-154-26X,Granted Patent,yes,25,41,7,8,0,G02B7/00;;G02B7/00,G01B11/00;;H01L21/68;;G01Q30/02;;G01Q30/04;;G02B7/00;;G05D3/12;;H01L21/66,348/126;;348/135,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION. Jan. 25, 1952, No. 2055/52. Class 37 A conductor cable of high specific resistance particularly suitable for use as an H.T. ignition/radio interference suppressor cable is in the form of a cord of nylon or glass or other fibres impregnated with particles of carbon or metals, such as aluminium, copper or iron, or metal oxides, sulphides, carbides, nitrides or borides. In the manufacture of the cable an essential step consists in treatment with a wetting agent to' improve. the capillarity of the fibres. Fig. 2 shows a nylon 4-core braided cord and Fig. 1 a continuous roller process for impregnating such a cord with graphite. In Fig. 1 the cord passes continuously from a spool 2 into a de-sizing and de-greasing chloroform bath 4 and thence through a drying oven 8 into a tank 12 where it is submerged in an aqueous solution of wetting agent. The cord then passes through a drying oven 14 and into a colloidal graphite impregnating tank 18 which also contains a small proportion of wetting agent. A compression die 20 squeezes the cord as it emerges from the tank 18 and passes into the impregnant drying oven 22 ; the final stages consist in immersion in boiling water in tank 26, for removal of surface or excess wetting agent, drying in an oven 28 and winding on a spool 30. If one dip in the impregnating solution is not sufficient to produce the desired thickness of graphite coating the equipment items 18, 20, 22 are repeated. In the treated cord each single fibre 40, Fig. 6, comprises an inner coating of wetting agent and an outer uniform coating of graphite 42. The cable in service form has an outer covering of rubber, Figs. 4-5 (not shown). The Specification includes references to preferred graphite impregnating and wetting agent solutions and concentrations and gives full instructions covering dipping and drying periods and oven temperatures.",GEN MOTORS CORP,BUCHANAN ROSS W;;SMITH ROBERT W;;MCDOUGAL TAINE G,,https://lens.org/154-046-908-056-927,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H01B1/24,H01B1/24,H1S SMH           SMH,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Each processing station may assemble glazing panes and a glazing spacer into a partially fabricated glazing unit, deliver insulative gas to a between-pane space between the glazing panes, and press the partially fabricated glazing unit together to seal the insulative gas in the between-pane space and form the multiple-pane insulating glazing unit. In some examples, each processing station moves to an alignment position with the conveyor to load glazing panes and a glazing spacer and then performs individual fabrication steps while offset from the conveyor.

Endless track vehicles. MASSEY-FERGUSON (GREAT BRITAIN) Ltd. Oct. 20, 1955 [Nov. 2, 1954; April 1, 1955; July 22, 1955], Nos. 31672/54, 9532/55, and 21213/55. Class 79(1) A tractor has an endless track attachment comprising an arm 7 carrying an idler wheel 6, round which, and round the associated driving ground wheel 1 of the tractor, an endless track 8 is fitted, the arm 7 being mounted on the tractor so as to be capable of moving the idler wheel both forwardly and towards the ground. As shown in Fig. 1 the arm 7 carries the idler wheel 6 at its forward end, and is pivotally connected at its rearward end to one end of a link 20 pivotally connected at its other end to the tractor axle assembly at 22. Bolted to the latter assembly is a bracket 27 having three pivot pin connection apertures 27a, 27b, and 27c, which form alternative attachment points for a telescopic spring unit 35, the other end of which is attached to one end of a link 30. The other end of the link 30 is pivotally connected at 31 to a pair of lugs 29 rigid with the arm 7. When a single compression spring unit 35 is employed (Fig. 6, not shown), one of the attachment apertures 27a, 27b, 27c may be selected in accordance with the degree of inclination of the line of action of the spring unit desired. As shown, however, a second spring unit 35a is employed, and in this case the unit 35 is connected to the aperture 27a, and the apertures 27b, and 27c are used for mounting a bracket 53 forming the upper attachment of the unit 35a. The upper end of the unit 35a is connected to the bracket 53 via a link 30a which is similar to the link 30. The lower end of the unit 35a is connected to the junction of a pair of links 57, 60, the other ends of which are connected respectively to the pivot of the unit 35 with the link 30, and a pivot pin 45 carried by the lugs 29. In normal operation of the tractor, the parts are disposed as shown in Fig. 3. When it is desired to remove the track 8 from the wheels 1 and 6, a spanner is used as shown in dot-dash lines in Fig. 1, to apply a force to the pivot pin 42 between the lower end of the unit 35 and the link 30 to turn the link and unit through a dead-centre position to the position shown in Fig. 1. The unit 35 is then able to expand until a stop 44 on the unit engages an abutment 33 to prevent its further extension. The unit 35a and the link 31a are similarly turned through a dead-centre position, and it is then possible to move the arm 7 rearwardly so as to decrease the distance between the centres of the wheels 1 and 6 and so remove the tracks 8. Alternatively, where a single unit 35 is employed (Fig. 6, not shown), the arm 7 may be drawn rearwardly against the action of the unit 35. This may be effected mechanically by providing a lug on the lower surface of the arm 7 which may thus be connected by a chain to part of the vehicle power-lift mechanism. The track 8 comprises two fabric-reinforced rubber bands 9 (Fig. 5) which are prestretched in manufacture. The bands 9 are interconnected by cross members 10 having inwardly directed projections 11 adapted to engage between the usual lugs on the tracfor tyre treads. The track of the wheels 6 is variable by interposing spacing blocks and by reversing the wheels, each of which has an attachment flange disposed out of the plane of symmetry of the wheel (Fig. 2, not shown).",MASSEY FERGUSON GREAT BRITAIN,SENKOWSKI ALEXANDER;;WATSON ERIC ISAAC;;HOCKEY WALTER STANLEY;;ANNAT ROBERT BUCHANAN,,https://lens.org/158-053-411-436-263,Granted Patent,no,0,3,1,4,0,B62D49/0635;;B60C27/20;;B62D55/02,B60C27/20;;B62D49/06;;B62D55/02,B7H HB            HB;;B7H H702          HB,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Accordingly, measurement or inspection of the wafer does not require that the wafer be mounted on a precision stage. This allows the wafer to be at rest on any structure native in a processing apparatus when the system measures or inspects the wafer. Accordingly, measurement does not require removing the wafer from the processing apparatus and does not delay processing since the wafer can be measured, for example, during a required cool down period of device fabrication process. Alignment of an optical system includes pre-alignment base on edge detection using the optical system and more precise alignment using image recognition. An R-θ stage can position the optical system at inspection areas on the wafer. Image rotation can provide a fixed orientation for all images at the various inspection areas and can maintain the fixed orientation when moving from one inspection area to the next.",NANOMETRICS INC,SPADY BLAINE R;;HEATON JOHN D;;BUCHANAN ROBERT;;YARUSSI RICHARD A,NANOMETRICS INCORPORATED (1999-12-07),https://lens.org/010-505-350-639-514,Granted Patent,yes,49,33,1,8,0,G01N21/9501;;G01N21/9501,G01B11/00;;G01B11/14;;G01N21/00;;G06K9/00,356/401;;356/237.1;;356/614;;382/141;;382/145;;382/151,10,0,,,"Peter Rosenthal, ""Integrated FTIR reflectometer controls semiconductor fabrication process"", (Laser Focus World, Apr. 1998).;;Nova Measuring Instruments Ltd.

The technical field of the invention concerns the production from hydrocarbonaceous feeds of hydrogen-rich gases and use of the same in various synthesis operations. An autothermal reforming process, as illustrated in Figure 2 of the drawings, comprises carrying out partial oxidation of a hydrocarbonaceous feed by introducing an oxidant gas (e.g., air), steam and hydrocarbonaceous feed (e.g., a hydrocarbon) into an apparatus (24), as illustrated in detail in Figure 3, which contains a catalytic partial oxidation section (24a). A monolithic catalyst (27) comprising palladium and platinum and, optionally, rhodium, distended upon a stabilized alumina wash-coat is contained within section (24a). At least one half by weight of the hydrocarbonaceous feed is catalytically oxidized in section (24a) at a high throughput rate to produce a heated effluent suitable for further processing, such as being passed through a steam reforming catalyst (31) contained in section (24b) of apparatus (24).

    The invention relates to a tape printing apparatus for printing an image on an image receiving tape. In order to detect characteristics of the tape thus avoiding representation means on a tape cassette, it is proposed to have detecting means for detecting-markings provided on the image receiving tape, which provide information on a characteristic of the tape; and the tape printing apparatus is controlled in accordance with the detected characteristics. Alternatively, it is proposed to have monitoring means for monitoring the speed of the image receiving tape, which detect marking on the image receiving tape whereby the printing means is controlled in dependence on the detected speed. Consequently, the exact tape speed is considered for printing purposes, even when slippage between driving means and tape occurs.

A monolithic catalyst (27) comprising palladium and platinum and, optionally, rhodium, distended upon a stabilized alumina wash-coat is contained within section (24a). At least one half by weight of the hydrocarbonaceous feed is catalytically oxidized in section (24a) at a high throughput rate to produce a heated effluent suitable for further processing, such as being passed through a steam reforming catalyst (31) contained in section (24b) of apparatus (24).

    Disclosed is a process for the preparation of amines by continuously feeding a carboxamide, aqueous alkaline hypohalite, and aqueous alkaline hydroxide to a first reaction zone to form a N-halocarboxamide, measuring the concentration of at least one reaction component in the effluent from the first reaction zone, and using the result of that measurement to control the feed rate of at least one of the feed components of to achieve at least 90% conversion of the carboxamide in the first reaction zone. The effluent from the first reaction zone is fed continuously to a second reaction zone where it further reacts to form an aqueous solution of an amine. The effluent from the second reaction zone may be fed continuously to a distillation column. The process is particularly useful for the preparation of cyclopropylamine.

In cross-sections taken along its length, the arm comprises a series of symmetrical ellipses of nearly constant area. The arm (24) is arranged so that, in use, the major axes of each of the ellipses of the cross-sections are parallel to the windshield (20) of a motor vehicle on which it is used. The base section (A) of the arm (24) is wider and thinner, giving good up and down flexibility combined with good side to side stiffness. The tip section (C) of the arm (24) is narrower and thicker, thereby maintaining the same basic profile, but imparting more torsional rigidity. The intermediate section (B) of the arm (24) provides a smooth transition from the base section (A) to the tip section (C).

    Methods and apparatus are provided for processing messages for access to information stored in an open directory. A Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) LDAP Validation Proxy (LVP) is used to intercept LDAP request messages intended for the directory, validates the LDAP requests according to a schema description and optionally provides side-effects. The schema validation and LDAP message processing is modularized according to object classes representing the data stored in the directory and according to services provided. The schema is enforced by validating LDAP messages. This modularization provides a controlled message processing granularity and enables multi-threaded concurrent processing of multiple LDAP messages. The LVP has the capability of generating LDAP requests in processing LDAP messages. The LVP also intercepts and processes LDAP responses issued by a directory and intended for clients.
