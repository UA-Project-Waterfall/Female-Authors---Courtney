    The architecture of the inventive correlator is, in a preferred embodiment, an array of correlation cells each containing a delay pipe, a math unit and an accumulator. An array of these correlation cells are tiled together to allow simultaneous processing by all cells. The array is disposed so that each cell accumulates an output value in a result surface. There is no electrical limit to the number of correlation cells that may be tiled together. A preferred embodiment uses nine cells tiled together into a 33 correlation result surface. Other embodiments have been tested in accordance with the present invention having twenty-five cells tiled together into a 55 correlation result surface. A stream of compare pixel values is presented to the array wherein each compare pixel value is presented to each cell concurrently. A reference memory supplies the appropriate reference pixel values to the cells to enable all calculations for that compare pixel value to be done concurrently. The results of those calculations are summed in each cell's accumulator. The process is repeated for each compare pixel value in the stream. When all compare pixel values in the stream have been processed, the values in the accumulators are compared. Generally, the lowest value is accepted as the correlation value.

SOLUTION: An OSD generator 40 that is provided on a television receiver and performs an on-screen display(OSD) operation supplies OSD blanking pulses to a matrix stage 17 based on one line each in an OSD character generation period. These blanking pulses are also connected to a scan velocity modulation(SVM) inhibition circuit 19 and selectively inhibits a normal SVM operation on an SVM stage 35 in an OSD generation period.

The parallelism provided by a database manager in executing user-defined functions provides an easy way to implement parallelism for database and non-database functions in a computer program without the need of hard-coding all the parallelism support in the computer program itself. A database table is defined with instructions the user wants to execute in parallel. A user-defined function is then defined that executes the instructions in the table. A database operation is then defined for the table that invokes the user-defined function. When the database operation is executed, the database manager provides parallelism by executing multiple tasks in parallel in the user-defined function. The built-in parallelism in many modem database managers thus may be used to enable parallelism in a computer program by using user-defined functions in a manner not previously thought of before.",IBM,ANDERSON MARK J,LINKEDIN CORPORATION (2014-03-31);;INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (2004-01-07),https://lens.org/002-975-820-004-545,Patent Application,yes,5,20,2,2,0,G06F16/24532;;G06F16/24532,G06F17/00;;G06F17/30,707/102,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In a preferred embodiment, coefficients cause the array to form a ""saddle"" shape when the coefficient values are representative of the local slope on a surface described by the array. This ""saddle"" shape enables improved filtration properties. The inventive spatial filter is further advantageously embodied in architecture comprising an array of individual calculation modules corresponding to the filter array. Rows of modules are coupled together in parallel. The input signal is fed to each row concurrently via FIFO buffers, enabling concurrent calculation operations. After calculation, output values for each module are accumulated and summed, the result being placed into an output stream. The FIFO buffers then present the next input values in the input stream to the calculation modules, and so on. The result is a low-latency ""streaming"" filtration that is further economical on hardware, requiring only FIFO storage resources. Advantageously, the entire inventive filter may be conveniently deployed as a digital signal processor (""DSP"") on a unitary integrated circuit chip.",HEWLETT PACKARD CO,ANDERSON MARK A,HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY (2001-08-28);;AVAGO TECHNOLOGIES GENERAL IP (SINGAPORE) PTE.

   An atomic force microscope (AFM) tip is used to selectively produce surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for localized Raman spectroscopy. Spectra of thin films, undetectable with a Raman microprobe spectrometer alone, are readily acquired in contact with a suitably gold-coated AFM tip. Similarly, an AFM tip is used to remove sample layers at the nanometer scale and subsequently serve as a SERS substrate for ultra-trace analysis. This demonstrates the interface of an AFM with a Raman spectrometer that provides increases sensitivity, selectivity and spatial resolution over a conventional Raman microprobe. An AFM guiding the SERS effect has the potential for targeted single molecule spectroscopy.

SOLUTION: A luminance video signal YS generated by a luminance processor 15 is supplied to an input buffer amplifier 30 on an SVM step 35. The output of the amplifier 30 is supplied to the input of a differentiation circuit 31. Differentiating processing is performed to the differentiated video signal. Next, that video signal is impressed to a limiter, namely, the input of an amplitude limiting amplifier 32. During an OSD character generation period or an image display period due to an additional video signal source, the ordinary operation of the SVM step 35 is selectively inhibited. An output signal line 40C from an OSD generator 40 is connected to the SVM step 35, and during the period of OSD generation, SVM operation is changed so that the appearance of visible artifact during the OSD operating period can be decreased.",THOMSON CONSUMER ELECTRON INC,ANDERSON MARK R,,https://lens.org/070-482-615-305-657,Patent Application,no,0,1,48,48,0,H04N3/32;;H04N3/32;;H04N3/32,H04N1/17;;G09G1/00;;G09G1/04;;H04N3/16;;H04N3/32;;H04N5/257;;H04N5/40;;H04N5/445,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

First, a catheter is inserted into the cervical tract of the animal. A membrane, initially positioned inside a tube section of the catheter, is then extended from an opening in the tube and into the tract under pressure. The membrane extends into the tract without friction thereby reducing the discomfort and the risk of trauma or injury to the animal. When the membrane is fully extended into the tract, pressure causes the tip of the membrane to open thereby releasing the AI fluid and depositing the genetic material suspended in the fluid into the reproductive tract.

The membrane extends into the tract without friction thereby reducing the discomfort and the risk of trauma or injury to the animal. When the membrane is fully extended into the tract, pressure causes the tip of the membrane to open thereby releasing the AI fluid and depositing the genetic material suspended in the fluid into the reproductive tract. In addition to AI and embryo transplant, other applications for the pathway include other therapeutic, diagnostic or procedures, such as introducing fluoroscopic cameras, instruments, and drug delivery.

   A method and apparatus for safer and more effective deep trans-cervical intra-uterine artificial insemination (AI) is provided. Such a deep AI catheter causes minimal discomfort and risk of trauma, and does not require the services of a highly trained AI professional. First, a catheter is inserted into the cervical tract of the animal. A membrane, initially positioned inside a tube section of the catheter, is then extended from an opening in the tube and into the tract under pressure. The membrane extends into the tract without friction thereby reducing the discomfort and the risk of trauma or injury to the animal. When the membrane is fully extended into the tract, pressure causes the tip of the membrane to open thereby releasing the AI fluid and depositing the genetic material suspended in the fluid into the reproductive tract. In addition to AI and embryo transplant, other applications for the pathway include other therapeutic, diagnostic or procedures, such as introducing fluoroscopic cameras, instruments, and drug delivery.

    The present invention is an optical ice detection probe capable of detecting the presence, thickness and continued buildup of ice. The invention works by attaching the probe to the external surface of an airplane such as the wing, fuselage or empannage. The probe has a recessed surface, which is mounted to face directly into the airflow. One or more beams are passed over and parallel to the recessed surface. These beams can be of any useful wavelength, however for best results visible, infrared or ultraviolet beams should be used. Ice on the recessed surface interrupts the beams thereby indicating the presence of ice. If two or more beams are used, then each beam emitter is paired with a beam detector and the corresponding beam detector only detects the beam from that emitter. This can be accomplished by numerous methods. For example, powering each beam emitter alternately and sampling the output of the corresponding detector, electronically modulating the beam to a specific frequency with corresponding detectors designed to respond to the specific frequency or using an optical filter that passes only specific wavelengths.

The mounting system includes a backplate, disposed beneath the motherboard, with pins protruding up through the motherboard, and a linkage assembly, which is fixably attached to a base portion of a heatsink assembly. The linkage assembly includes scoops, for grasping the pins during engagement, and a ratcheting system, for compressing the heatsink and thermal interface material onto the package. The mounting system is designed to effectively distribute the heatsink weight, as well as the forces caused by chronic and dynamic stresses, through, rather than upon the motherboard, such as to a chassis. The mounting system thus alleviates stress cracks, component pullout, solderball stress, and other damaging conditions to the motherboard. The mounting system may be engaged and disengaged without the use of tools.",INTEL CORP,ECKBLAD MICHAEL;;ANDERSON MARK,,https://lens.org/019-575-388-456-992,Patent of Addition,no,0,0,7,7,0,H01L21/4882;;H01L23/4093;;H01L2924/0002;;Y10T29/5313;;Y10T29/53196;;Y10T29/53252;;Y10T29/53178;;Y10T29/49126;;Y10T29/53174;;Y10T29/53265;;Y10T29/4913;;Y10T29/5313;;Y10T29/53196;;Y10T29/53252;;Y10T29/53178;;Y10T29/49126;;Y10T29/53174;;Y10T29/53265;;Y10T29/4913;;H01L21/4882;;H01L23/4093;;H01L2924/0002,H01L21/48;;H01L23/40;;H05K7/20,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The method includes the steps of (1) heating biomass in a first molten liquid bath at a first temperature, wherein the first temperature is at least about 100° C., but less than the decomposition temperature of the biomass, wherein gas comprising water is evaporated and air is pressed from the biomass, thereby yielding dried biomass with minimal air content. (2) Recapturing the moisture evaporated from the biomass in step 1 for use in the process gas. (3) Heating the dried biomass in a second molten liquid bath at a second temperature, wherein the second temperature is sufficiently high to cause flash pyrolysis of the dried biomass, thereby yielding product gases, tar, and char.

The selected portion of the stack moves with virtually no cross-wise (i.e., lateral) shifting among the plates and virtually no friction between the moving portion of the stack and the guide rods because (1) a keystone bushing below the weight plate stack provides virtually error free alignment with the guide rods by setting the non-selected portion of the stack at a highly accurate “home” position that resets the moving stack if it has shifted laterally during movement, even if that shift is very slight, and (2) the guide rod holed in the weight plates carry bushings which align with the bushings of the adjacent weight plates to prevent the plates within the moving portion of the stack from shifting laterally with respect to each other and thereby contacting a guide rod. Preferably, the topmost weight plate in the moving portion of the stack carries bushings forming a smaller gap with the guide rods than the bushings of the remaining weight plates so that, at worst, only the topmost plate will contact a guide rod resulting in negligible friction.",PRODUCTS INC GRACE PREMIER FITNESS AND WELLNESS;;ACE SPECIALTY INC;;GRACE PREMIER FITNESS AND WELLNESS PRODUCTS INC,ANDERSON KARL;;HARIGIAN MARK,ACE SPECIALTY INC (2013-02-25);;ANDERSON KARL (2012-03-29);;GRACE PREMIER FITNESS AND WELLNESS PRODUCTS INC (2013-02-25),https://lens.org/075-818-794-909-568,Patent Application,yes,0,6,2,2,0,A63B21/0601;;A63B21/0628;;A63B21/062;;A63B21/0601;;A63B21/0628,A63B21/062,482/98,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

First, a catheter is inserted into the cervical tract of the animal. A membrane, initially positioned inside a tube section of the catheter, is then extended from an opening in the tube and into the tract under pressure. The membrane extends into the tract without friction thereby reducing the discomfort and the risk of trauma or injury to the animal. When the membrane is fully extended into the tract, pressure causes the tip of the membrane to open thereby releasing the AI fluid and depositing the genetic material suspended in the fluid into the reproductive tract.

In some embodiments, an optical pulse is generated and divergently projected from a first optical fiber. A collimating lens (30) is aligned within the divergently projected optical pulse collimating a portion thereof. The collimated and uncollimated portions of the optical pulse are projected into the small and large sampling volumes of the cloud atmosphere, respectively. The ratio of the collimated to the uncollimated portions can be optically controlled. Signals corresponding to optical pulses having different collimated/uncollimated ratios are backscattered by the cloud atmosphere, detected and compared to one another. A processor is configured to calculate, based on scintillation spike differences between the optical pulses of different collimated/uncollimated ratios, a size and/or density of SLDs.

   A method and apparatus for safer and more effective deep trans-cervical intra-uterine artificial insemination (AI) is provided. Such a deep AI catheter causes minimal discomfort and risk of trauma, and does not require the services of a highly trained AI professional. First, a catheter is inserted into the cervical tract of the animal. A membrane, initially positioned inside a tube section of the catheter, is then extended from an opening in the tube and into the tract under pressure. The membrane extends into the tract without friction thereby reducing the discomfort and the risk of trauma or injury to the animal. When the membrane is fully extended into the tract, pressure causes the tip of the membrane to open thereby releasing the AI fluid and depositing the genetic material suspended in the fluid into the reproductive tract. Deployment of the membrane is facilitated by tapering its wall thickness towards its tip. In addition to AI and embryo transplant, other applications for the pathway include therapeutic, diagnostic, or other procedures such as introducing fluoroscopic cameras, instruments, and drug delivery.

The apparatus generally comprises a radio frequency polypectome snare which includes a hand grip assembly, a flexible tubing assembly capable of fitting within an endoscope, an electrode loop portion and a power supply means. The hand grip assembly is made of molded pieces of inflexible plastic comprising a longitudinal housing portion and a slide member having opposing finger grip members. When the slide member is in its most proximal position, the electrode loop portion is withdrawn into the flexible tubing. As the slide member is advanced toward the distal end of the longitudinal housing, the electrode wires are advanced out of the flexible tubing, forming a loop that can be placed around the stem of a polyp. Once again withdrawing the loop into the end of the flexible tubing while simultaneously applying RF voltage shears the polyp at its base. The slide member and housing are designed to be molded using conventional equipment, a significant improvement over the prior art in which several pieces had been proportioned by hand. This is possible because the molded housing of the hand grip is fitted with a longitudinal slot which receives the molded slide member in such manner that the only movement permitted is proximal or distal to the tubing. The electrode wires are affixed to a molded slide block on the slide member and are encased in rigid conductor tubes that extend the full length of the housing. A molded guide and retaining hub further stabilize the wires in the distal end of the housing. The electrode wires thus remain insulated from one another and do not short or arc because this stabilized arrangement at the distal end of the housing works in tandem with the stabilizing aspect of the slide member slide block to prohibit twisting of the wires or conductor tubes.",EVEREST MEDICAL CORP,RYDELL MARK A;;ANDERSON BRENT L,EVEREST MEDICAL CORPORATION (1990-09-24),https://lens.org/033-887-219-872-602,Granted Patent,yes,4,230,1,1,0,A61B18/14;;A61B18/14;;A61B17/32056;;A61B17/32056;;A61B18/1402;;A61B18/1402;;A61B2018/1407;;A61B2018/1407,A61B17/32;;A61B18/14,606/47;;606/48;;606/113,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Then, the ties are attached to hospital equipment, or opposing ties may be attached to each other.",AUGUSTINE MEDICAL INC,ANDERSON THOMAS P;;BRIER MARK F,ARIZANT HEALTHCARE INC (2003-02-17);;3M INNOVATIVE PROPERTIES COMPANY (2013-12-12);;GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION (2010-10-13),https://lens.org/074-322-918-842-313,Granted Patent,yes,54,7,2,2,0,A61F7/0097;;A61F2007/006;;A61F2007/0091;;A61F2007/0268;;A61F7/0097;;A61F2007/006;;A61F2007/0268;;A61F2007/0091,A61F7/00;;A61F7/02,607/107;;607/114;;62/259.3;;5/423,5,0,,,"Definition of ""flap"", Webster's II New Collegiate Dictionary (1995) p. 425.;;Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary definition of ""laminate"".;;Webster's Third New International Dictionary, p. 250, definition of ""bond"".;;McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science & Technology, 7th Ed., p. 713, definition of ""bonding"".;;""Normothermia in the OR"" Augustine Medical, Inc., Oct. 1989.",EXPIRED

After the plug is formed in the via, a thin (e.g., <100 nm) isolation layer is deposited over the resulting structure. An opening is created in the isolation layer by using the same mask at a different radiation exposure level to make the opening more narrow than the underlying plug. A conductive line is then formed which makes electrical contact with the plug through the opening in the isolation layer. By vertically separating and electrically isolating the conductive plug from adjacent conductive lines, the isolation layer advantageously reduces the likelihood of an undesired electrical short occurring between the conductive plug and a nearby conductive line.",MICRON TECHNOLOGY INC,ALBERTSON TODD;;MILLER DARIN;;ANDERSON MARK,,https://lens.org/084-243-194-355-989,Patent Application,yes,41,0,6,6,0,H01L21/76834;;H01L21/76834;;H01L21/76801;;H01L21/76801,H01L31/113;;H01L21/302;;H01L21/768;;H01L27/108;;H01L29/76;;H01L29/94;;H01L31/062;;H01L31/119,257/292;;257/308,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
