BOWENS SALES & SERVICE Ltd. Feb. 28, 1966 [Nov.26, 1964], No.48128/64. Heading G2A. In apparatus for copying transparencies, the correct exposure required is assessed by measuring the light transmitted through the transparency by a photo-cell. As shown, the transparency is mounted in a movable frame 15 over an aperture 13 in the top face 12 of a housing 11. Below the aperture is a diffusing screen 14. The photo-cell is enclosed in a case 17 which can slide on rails 16 into and out of position over the aperture (see also Fig.1, not shown). The light source may be a single lamp but is preferably an assembly consisting of a flash tube 21 and a pair of small incandescent lamps 122 see also Fig. 3, not shown). These are carried on a support 19 which can be moved up and down vertical guide rods 23 by means outside the housing 11. This movement can be carried out, using the lamps 22 as a light source, until a predetermined reading is obtained by the photo-cell, as shown by a meter (35, Fig.1, not shown). The photo-cell is then retracted out of the light path, and the photographic exposure made using the flash tube.",BOWENS SALES AND SERVICE LTD,BOWEN KENNETH SAMUEL,,https://lens.org/165-557-466-291-13X,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,G03B27/72,G03B27/72,G2A ABH           BH;;G2A ABHX          ABHX/404;;G2A A404          ABHX/404;;G2A A404          BH;;G2A A411          BH;;G2A A497          BH;;G2A A521          BH;;G2A A527          BH;;G2A A535          BH;;G2A A554          BH;;G2A A556          BH;;G2A A558          BH;;G2A A563          BH;;G2A A604          BH;;G2A A608          BH;;G2A A615          BH;;G2A A704          BH;;G2A A711          BH,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A repeater allows terminals of a first communications system, employing a first air protocol or radio interface, to communicate with terminals of a second communications system, employing a second air protocol or radio interface different from the first. Where the first and second air protocols differ only in operating frequency, but are otherwise compatible, the repeater may linearly translate signals from the first operating frequency to the second operating frequency, and vice versa, without demodulating and remodulating the signals. Where the air protocols differ in other ways, the repeater receives and demodulates signals from the first system, converts the signals to a common format, and remodulates and retransmits the signals according to the second air protocol (and vice versa), in the same frequency bands or in different frequency bands. The repeater translates control and signalling information transmitted in compliance with one air protocol to a format which complies with the other air protocol and has the same or equivalent effect. For each of the two communications system, the repeater emulates the functions of a terminal in that communications system, so that corresponding terminals in that system may communicate transparently with the repeater. The repeater provides a connection between the two emulated terminals, thereby allowing a terminal of the first system to use the repeater to communicate with an otherwise incompatible terminal of the second system.
