A second metal is incorporated into said molten flux during the oxidation reaction. The resulting ceramic body includes sufficient second metal such that one or more properties of said ceramic body are at least partially affected by the presence and properties of said second metal in the metallic constituent.,LANXIDE TECHNOLOGY CO LTD;;AGHAJANIAN MICHAEL KEVORK;;NEWKIRK MARC STEVENS;;KENNEDY CHRISTOPHER ROBIN;;KANTNER ROBERT CAMPBELL;;ROCAZELLA MICHAEL ANGELO;;WEINSTEIN JERRY GLENN;;WHITE DANNY RAY;;SCHIROKY GERHARD HANS;;JOHNSON WILLIAM BAYARD,AGHAJANIAN MICHAEL KEVORK;;NEWKIRK MARC STEVENS;;KENNEDY CHRISTOPHER ROBIN;;KANTNER ROBERT CAMPBELL;;ROCAZELLA MICHAEL ANGELO;;WEINSTEIN JERRY GLENN;;WHITE DANNY RAY;;SCHIROKY GERHARD HANS;;JOHNSON WILLIAM BAYARD,,https://lens.org/099-824-580-308-451,Patent Application,yes,4,2,4,56,0,C04B35/652;;C04B35/652,C04B35/65,,0,0,,,,PENDING
