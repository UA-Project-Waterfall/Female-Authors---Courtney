   The present invention relates to a method of implementing, using and also testing a machine learning system. Preferably the system employs the Nave Bayesian prediction algorithm in conjunction with a feature data structure to provide probability distributions for an input record belonging to one or more categories. Elements of the feature data structure may be prioritized and sorted with a view to selecting relevant elements only for use in the calculation of a probability indication or distribution. A method of testing is also described which allows the influence of one input learning data record to be removed from the system with the same record being used to subsequently test the accuracy of the system.

    A programmable non-volatile data storage calibration circuit stores a calibration code for a temperature sensor circuit of an IC, comprising a programmable array of addressable bi-state, bi-stable first circuit elements each comprising a fusible resistor. A power supply controlled by a data input signal addresses the first circuit elements to be switched from a first to a second state in the fusible resistor state, the supply, and a clock signal applied to an I/O terminal clocks the data input signal to the interpreter circuit. The interpreter circuit sequentially selects and addresses the first circuit elements and enables switching of the first circuit elements when the supply voltage is at its maximum, blowing a selected fusible resistor. A second, similar circuit element is switched to its second state after programming the calibration circuit to prevent its further programming.

A number of different masks may be applied to the data sequence at a number of locations. At least some of the masks may include indels and/or substitutions. The masks may be manually or computer generated. The data sequence may be one or more reference templates and/or one or more sample sequences, such as DNA or RNA sequences. Sample data may be stored in the one or more index by correlating masked values of reads with index key values and storing an identifier for each read in association with a corresponding index key value. Sample data sequences may be evaluated by comparing sample sequence and template sequences having the same index key value and determining scores for the reads based on the comparison and associating the scores with the reads. Reads may be rejected based upon the comparison. A read may be rejected if there is more than one position at which it has a best score. A read may be rejected if its score falls below a threshold score level.",CLEARY JOHN GERALD,CLEARY JOHN GERALD,REAL TIME GENOMICS INC (2011-07-14),https://lens.org/097-108-714-895-736,Patent Application,yes,0,11,4,4,0,G16B30/00;;G16B30/10;;G16B30/00;;G16B30/10;;G16B30/00;;G16B30/10,G01N33/48;;G16B30/00;;G16B30/10,702/19,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Circuitry is provided to pull the input node to a known voltage when the input signal is in its hi-Z state. The transistors are series-connected to respective current sources, with the junctions between the transistors and their current sources forming the circuit's binary outputs. The output impedances of the current sources are made less than those of their respective transistors, so that when turned on by the input signal, a transistor pulls its associated output high or low. The circuit produces a unique binary output for each of the three input signal states.

   A purine or pyrimidine analog having a reactive moiety not normally present in RNA is incorporated into RNA during a defined time period in a cell of interest, where the cell of interest comprises a phosphoribosyltransferase or nucleoside kinase that can specifically incorporate the analogs into the corresponding nucleotide. The nucleotide is then retained by the cell until it is synthesized in RNA. The labeled RNA can be specifically purified away from all other molecules and finds use in hybridization to microarrays; hybridization to blots; real time PCR; reverse transcriptase PCR, in vitro translation; cross-linking to interacting molecules, and the like.

Templates are stored in a persistent storage area of the configurator generator and are recalled when a change or deletion to the resulting configurator is desired. The configurator generator provides the user with a simple, intuitive, and computer assisted way of producing or modifying templates.

    The present invention is connected across a sense resistor which carries a current of interest. A first pair of cross-coupled switches are connected between the sense resistor and respective input capacitors, and a second pair of cross-coupled switches are connected between the input capacitors and the inputs of an amplifier having differential inputs and outputs. Feedback capacitors are connected between each of the amplifier's outputs and inputs. A control circuit operates the cross-coupled switches in accordance with a switching cycle, during which the connections between the sense resistor and the input capacitors are interchanged, after which the connections between the input capacitors and the differential amplifier are interchanged. When so arranged, the sensed voltage is sampled on the input capacitors and transferred to the feedback capacitors to produce a differential output voltage V _{ out } from the differential amplifier which is proportional to the current of interest.

A proximity algorithm detects conditions interpreted as indicating a user is close to, but not touching, a sensor. When such proximity is detected, ambient value calibration is halted, thereby avoiding treating the human's proximity as environmental drift requiring compensation and preventing miscalculation of calibration. The proximity algorithm employs two moving-average filters (implemented in hardware or software) to monitor the CDC output values over time and to make appropriate adjustments to a signal representing the ambient, while distinguishing environmental drift from proximity-induced pseudo-drift. Accurate ambient values allow for improved proximity detection by providing this environmentally compensated average value to an adaptive threshold algorithm which features a fast attack, slow decay peak detection to automatically track and compensate for different response characteristics (typically finger sizes).",ANALOG DEVICES INC,FEEN KEN;;COQUEREL LAURENT;;JEYAPAUL RICHARDSON;;CLEARY JOHN A,ANALOG DEVICES INC (2006-07-17),https://lens.org/065-080-560-581-482,Patent Application,yes,99,64,2,2,0,H03K17/955;;H03K2217/94026;;H03K17/955;;H03K2217/94026,G01F1/00,702/47,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

In a transmitter, the mixing signal frequency used to upconvert the outgoing baseband signal to IF is selected to pre-compensate for the frequency error resulting from upconverting the IF signal to RF using a less-than-ideal mixing frequency.

A proximity algorithm detects conditions interpreted as indicating a user is close to, but not touching, a sensor. When such proximity is detected, ambient value calibration is halted, thereby avoiding treating the human's proximity as environmental drift requiring compensation and preventing miscalculation of calibration. The proximity algorithm employs two moving-average filters (implemented in hardware or software) to monitor the CDC output values over time and to make appropriate adjustments to a signal representing the ambient, while distinguishing environmental drift from proximity-induced pseudo-drift. Accurate ambient values allow for improved proximity detection by providing this environmentally compensated average value to an adaptive threshold algorithm which features a fast attack, slow decay peak detection to automatically track and compensate for different response characteristics (typically finger sizes).",ANALOG DEVICES INC,FEEN KEN;;COQUEREL LAURENT;;JEYAPAUL RICHARDSON;;CLEARY JOHN ANTHONY,ANALOG DEVICES INC (2006-07-17),https://lens.org/091-503-590-007-929,Granted Patent,yes,103,40,2,2,0,H03K17/955;;H03K2217/94026;;H03K17/955;;H03K2217/94026,G01R11/18;;G01C23/00;;G01R31/265;;G01R33/36,702/57;;702/65;;702/68;;702/116,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The powder systems comprise a water-soluble crosslinkable agent, and alternatively or additionally, a strengthening component. Preferably, the crosslinkable agent is selected from the group consisting of amino resins, phenol resins, and mixed amino/phenol resins. The strengthening component melts and flows when heated, and resolidifies or cures. Preferably, the strengthening component melts, flows and cures with heat. In another aspect, the invention provides a powder/binder system comprising an oxidant and a reductant (a redox couple). When the binder is applied to the powder, the oxidant and reductant react to generate an acid that catalyzes crosslinking. As a result, the strength of the 3D article builds up at an enhanced rate.

   The present invention provides unique material systems and methods for 3D printing of articles having enhanced strength and durability. The powder systems comprise a water-soluble crosslinkable agent, and alternatively or additionally, a strengthening component. Preferably, the crosslinkable agent is selected from the group consisting of amino resins, phenol resins, and mixed amino/phenol resins. The strengthening component melts and flows when heated, and resolidifies or cures. Preferably, the strengthening component melts, flows and cures with heat. 

   In another aspect, the invention provides a powder/binder system comprising an oxidant and a reductant (a redox couple). When the binder is applied to the powder, the oxidant and reductant react to generate an acid that catalyzes crosslinking. As a result, the strength of the 3D article builds up at an enhanced rate. The oxidant may be in the powder, and the reductant in the binder; or the reductant may be in the powder, and the oxidant in the binder. Alternatively, both the oxidant and the reductant may be in the powder.

The correlated segments are analysed to determine whether the spacing is within a defined range indicating that a correlation threshold has been met. A processing methodology may be employed whereby a coarse potential alignment algorithm is first applied to determine potential alignment at a plurality of potential alignment positions, which are filtered based on alignment scores, and a fine alignment algorithm is then applied. Systems for performing the method include parallel processing architectures that may employ graphics processors as the parallel processors. This architecture enables correlation within a range to be inherently determined at each processing iteration as the parallel processors act as an N bit window. The method may be employed with a range of sequencers.",REAL TIME GENOMICS INC,INGLIS STUART JOHN;;TRIGG LEONARD ERIC;;LITTIN RICHARD HENRY;;WARE DAVID WILLIAM;;IRVINE SEAN ALISTAIR;;CLEARY JOHN GERALD;;GAYLAND GRAHAM CHARLES;;RATHOD MEHUL KAMLESH,,https://lens.org/021-598-593-482-552,Patent Application,no,4,0,9,9,0,G16B30/00;;G16B15/00;;G16B30/10;;G06F16/90344;;G16B30/00;;G16B30/10;;G16B15/00;;G16B30/00;;G16B30/10;;G06N5/04,G06F17/30;;G16B30/10,,2,1,011-475-279-284-328,pmc2377433;;18344523;;10.1093/nar/gkn105,"GOTOH O.: 'A space-efficient and accurate method for mapping and aligning cDNA sequences onto genomic sequence' NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH, [Online] vol. 36, no. 8., 2008, pages 2630 - 2638 Retrieved from the Internet: URL:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/;;KLOETZLI, J.

The correlated segments are analysed to determine whether the spacing is within a defined range indicating that a correlation threshold has been met. A processing methodology may be employed whereby a coarse potential alignment algorithm is first applied to determine potential alignment at a plurality of potential alignment positions, which are filtered based on alignment scores, and a fine alignment algorithm is then applied. Systems for performing the method include parallel processing architectures that may employ graphics processors as the parallel processors. This architecture enables correlation within a range to be inherently determined at each processing iteration as the parallel processors act as an N bit window. The method may be employed with a range of sequencers.",REAL TIME GENOMICS INC;;INGLIS STUART JOHN;;TRIGG LEONARD ERIC;;LITTIN RICHARD HENRY;;WARE DAVID WILLIAM;;IRVINE SEAN ALISTAIR;;CLEARY JOHN GERALD;;GAYLARD GRAHAM CHARLES;;RATHOD MEHUL KAMLESH,INGLIS STUART JOHN;;TRIGG LEONARD ERIC;;LITTIN RICHARD HENRY;;WARE DAVID WILLIAM;;IRVINE SEAN ALISTAIR;;CLEARY JOHN GERALD;;GAYLARD GRAHAM CHARLES;;RATHOD MEHUL KAMLESH,,https://lens.org/025-698-226-958-76X,Patent Application,yes,4,12,9,9,0,G16B30/00;;G16B15/00;;G16B30/10;;G06F16/90344;;G16B30/00;;G16B30/10;;G16B15/00;;G16B30/00;;G16B30/10;;G06N5/04,G16B30/10,,4,1,011-475-279-284-328,pmc2377433;;18344523;;10.1093/nar/gkn105,"KLOETZLI, J.
