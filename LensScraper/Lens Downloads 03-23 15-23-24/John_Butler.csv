The apparatus may be used with automatic priming means comprising a liquid collection vessel disposed for pivoting movement between a substantially level position for collection of liquid and a tilted position for discharge of collected liquid through a discharge orifice, the pivot axis being disposed such that the weight of collected liquid urges the vessel towards the discharge position and a counterbalance bias being provided to urge the vessel towards the collection position, whereby discharge takes place when the weight of collected liquid acting towards the discharge position overcomes the counterbalance bias. The apparatus is particularly for use in removal of waste water accumulated on a swimming pool cover, or for automatically regulating the level of water in a pool. <IMAGE>",BUTLER JOHN ARTHUR,BUTLER JOHN ARTHUR;;BUTLER DARREN JOHN,,https://lens.org/037-986-127-720-213,Patent Application,no,0,0,3,4,0,F04F10/02,F04F10/02,E1C C45           C45,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Moulding.-An apparatus for making and venting cores of various lengths and cross-sections has a table a, on which is placed a plate on which the core-boxes are formed by partitions b and ends d. The partitions fit into notches in the ends, the whole being held against a verticallyadjustable fence h by clamps e operated by a handle g. A tray z, carried by arms y on levers x, normally rests above a table n, but can be swung to bring its open front over each core-box in succession, the levers x being carried by a shaft w rocked by worm gearing and a handle 7. The tray is filled with sand to a certain level, and a scoop 68, Figs. 4 and 5, with two long blades 69, 72, is used to draw the required amount of sand from the tray to half-fill one box, the distance between the blades being adjusted so that this amount of sand is enclosed between them. A carriage 13, carrying the vent-wires 8, as described in Specification No. 13,249, A.D. 1901, and guided on rods 14<a>, is drawn forwards by chain gearing 17 and a handle 20 to pass the wires through the fence h, and one end d into the core-boxes. The vent-wires are prevented from sagging by a block 21 sliding on the rods 14<a>. The carriage 13 is connected by a hook 63 to a frame 61 sliding on the rods 14<a>, and connected hy rods 59 to a carriage 46, in which are a number of hoppers, spaced to suit the core-boxes, and each provided with a feeding-device to allow stiffening-irons to be dropped into the boxes at intervals as the ventwires are advanced. The feeding-devices are operated by stops (not shown) engaging a ratchetlever operating the feeding-devices simultaneously through bevel gearing. The vent-wires may be further supported during their passage through long core-boxes, by pairs of pivoted fingers 24 on a carriage 29 hooked to the carriage 46. The fingers are normally in a horizontal position clear of the boxes, but can be turned into a vertical position and locked by a handle 43<a> so that they grip the wires after they have entered the boxes. When the vent-wires have entered the further ends of the boxes, the fingers are released by a trip 45<a>. The boxes are then filled by a second use of the tray z and the scoop 68, and rammed. The hook 63 is disengaged to allow the carriages 29, 46 to be pushed back, and the handle 7 is operated to press the tray z upon the sand in the boxes, and to hold the sand and core-irons in place while the vent-wires are withdrawn. The tray is then drawn back, and the plate j carrying the boxes is raised on rollers k by operating plungers p, so that the plate and boxes may be moved on to the roller table n to allow the cores to be removed. Blocks 78, Fig. 12, may be placed between the partitions b to determine the lengths of the cores. The blocks have pins 74 engaging the partitions, and may be formed hollow to form cores with chamfered or other shaped ends. To facilitate the handling of cores of large diameter formed upon a mandrel, the core-irons are formed upon a wire net-work, Fig. 16, and are embedded in the core material at some suitable stage, for example after the first coat of loam has been applied to the mandrel or support. The wire net-work is rolled into a cylindrical form, Fig. 17, and its ends are secured by hooks &c. 80. The Provisional Specification states that suitable electrical devices may be used for guiding the vent wires through the boxes.",BUTLER JOHN,BUTLER JOHN,,https://lens.org/013-854-647-509-803,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Butler, J. March 25. Casting and moulding.-A yielding and collapsable core of the type described in Specification No. 19,934, A.D. 1902, is used to obtain chill castings in iron or hollow castings in steel, copper, aluminium, brass, or other metals or alloys. The cylindrical core bar e consists of a number of seg. ments, bolted together and to spiders h, and serving as guides for radial bars l, 4, to which the segments j<1> and the filling-strips y forming the chill surface are, respectively, connected. The chill segments are expanded and contracted by eccentrics o on vertical shafts m engaging recesses in the bars l, while the bars 4 are operated by eccentrics on a central shaft 6. The segments move on balls 10 on a plate a, on which the core bar is placed, the plate being fixed by screws c and cottars on a table b, on which the mould is placed. Some of the segments may be formed in parts hinged together, and may be provided with holes 13<a> filled with leam to diminish the chilling effect on parts of the casting, as in the case of casting cylinders with steam ports &c. Loam may be inserted in various parts 13 of the segments to facilitate the pouring of the metal. The whole of the parts are secured in position, when adjusted, by bolts 7, which also secure a plate 8 with a suspension ring 9. When the metal has commenced to set, the filling-pieces are withdrawn and the shafts m are slightly turned so that the segments may be collapsed by the contraction of the metal. The shafts m, 6 may be adjusted from above or below the mould. The joints between the parts of the chill surface may be filled with plumbago or other refractory material, and are locked in their adjusted position by a four-arm frame, centered on the shaft 6, and having snugs on the boss and at the ends of the arms to engage recesses in collars on shafts when the frame is lowered into the locking position. The invention may be used in the casting of chilled cylinders for steam, oil, &c. engines, or chilled turbine casings, &c. or in casting metals or alloys which contract to a considerable extent during cooling.",BUTLER JOHN,BUTLER JOHN,,https://lens.org/063-934-543-688-580,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Butler, J. April 9. Moulding.-In turn - over-table apparatus for moulding rice bowls, hollow-ware, &c. the moulding-boxes d, e are held in their correct positions on the turn-over-table a by means of clips b, c engaging projections f en the boxes.

The carriage v, carried by rails on a plate 15 on the hydraulically or otherwise operated platform y, carries pedestals 1 with spring-controlled blocks 2, which receive the trunnions 7 of the moulding-box e. The latter are preferably placed eccentrically, so that the box may always bear on the same portion of the platform z of the carriage. A hole E is formed in the carriage to enable the moulding-box to be turned over in one direction and in order that the runner may drop out. A packing-block 8, provided with spring buffers 26, may be provided on the carriage to enable both the boxes to be fixed to the turnover table at the same time. Clips 9 operated by cams from a handle 14 may be provided to hold the two boxes in their positions for casting while the carriage is wheeled away. To prevent shock, the platform y is raised to make the boxes nearly touch the turn-over table, and the final adjustment is made by cams 16.

Moulding.-Moulds for use in casting objects with broad flanges, such as railway wagon brake blocks, are formed to facilitate the withdrawal of the pattern and the insertion of cores, the moulding being effected on a machine adapted to vent the mould. Cores may be formed on a similar machine, and are provided with stiffening-irons so that they may be formed from green sand. A moulding-box d, Fig. 2, and pattern b (in this case used to form two brake blocks) are placed on a suitable turnover table a. The pattern flanges b<4> can be withdrawn by pins engaging cam slots in a disc c on a hand-operated shaft c', one flange being shown withdrawn. Stiffening-plates g are placed in position and sand rammed in till it reaches the level of apertures d', in which are metal tubes e<2> to receive plugs e passing into apertures in the flanges to form spaces for the cores. The rammer for this stage is forked to pass over the plates and to keep them in position during ramming. The plates are preferably corrugated to allow the vent pins to pass as shown. The ramming is then completed, and the cover - plate placed in position, the plugs being withdrawn and suitable cores h inserted. The mould can then be vented by pins k carried on a head i' sliding on standards i or by a second set of pins carried by a slide and entering the side of the mould. The table is then turned over, and the mould removed. The head i<2> is operated by a handle is, lever i<4>, and link i<3>, and is raised, when not in use, by a weight i<7>, and turned over to the position shown in dotted lines by the engagement of an arm i<8> with a pin i<9>. Fig. 6 shows a machine for making cores, in which a core box p in two or more parts is mounted on a turnover table o, the parts being opened and closed by cam slots in a disc s engaging pins on slides on which the parts are mounted, the disc being operated by a hand-wheel s<4>. The moulds for the separate cores t are rammed by hollow cylindrical or polyhedral rammers w, passing over the core irons g<2> and carried by a balanced head v, adjustably clamped on standards u. After ramming, the standards u are pulled forward against the adjustable stops o<3> on the framing to bring vent pins (not shown), carried by a head on a rear pair of standards, vertically over the cores, so that the cores may be vented. The head is balanced by a weight x<8> and operated by a hand-wheel x<7> and chain gearing through a pinion shaft x<3> and racks x<2> on the head. The vent pins are adjustable vertically in split sockets on the head, and their pointed ends are made separate, so that they may be readily renewed. Fig. 16 shows an arrangement for withdrawing the pattern from the mould for a hollow fluted column, the pattern side sections C, D being removed by links G, H connected to a handle I to avoid damage to the flutes &c. when the mould is removed from the turnover table A.",BUTLER JOHN,BUTLER JOHN,,https://lens.org/107-692-357-405-271,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

BIR-VAC Ltd. Jan.18, 1967 [March 25, 1966], No.13448/66. Heading C7F. Vacuum coating apparatus comprises an electron emitting filament 38 mounted in an annular housing 34 an aperture 41 allowing the electron beam to bombard the source material in crucible 29 mounted on a turn-table 26 so that the crucible position can be displayed vertically in a continuously variable manner, and a conical shield 39 which shields a substrate 40 from direct heat radiation from the filament 38 see Figures 2 and 6. The assembly is mounted in a vacuum chamber and three shafts 7, 8, 9 with outside handle 10 extend through baseplate 1. Fixed to shaft 7 is sprocket wheel 11 connected by chain 12 to sprocket wheel 13 which on turning turns crucible 29 on turn-table 26 about a shaft 21. The shaft 8 is connected via running nut 15 to a pivoted lever 17 which is forked at 19 to engage collar 20 fixed to shaft 21 mounted so as to be rotatable and axially displaceable in plate 5. By turning handle 10 on shaft 8 the crucible 29 is thus displaced vertically. A shutter 33 is fixed to shaft 9 by arm 32 so that the shutter can swing into position above the filament 38 to prevent contamination of substrate (40) at the start of heating. It is swung away when vapour deposition is started. In operation the charged crucible is placed in one of the holes 27 while in position of Figure 3 (not shown). Shaft 7 is turned to bring the hole into the lower position shown in Figure 6, handle 10 is then turned to raise turn-table 26 into the upper position in Figure 6, this position being adjustable and dependent on the temperature required in the crucible. In a further embodiment shown in Figure 7 the crucible is shielded by housing portion 100 from heat radiation during electron bombardment and both the lifting and rotation of the crucible are produced by shaft 8. The end 106 of lever 17 cooperates with a ring of teeth 101 fixed to shaft 21 which has a bearing 102 connected to a ring of teeth 103. A lateral pin 104 fixed to shaft 21 cooperates with teeth 103 and spring 105 urges shaft 21 downwardly. Turning of shaft 8 lifts end 106 which rides up the flank of one of the teeth 101 and turns turn-table 26. A number of crucibles can be brought successively to the bombardment position for each reciprocation of end 106. Both conductive and non-conductive materials may be evaporated.",BIR VAC LTD,BUTLER ALAN JOHN,,https://lens.org/066-552-806-515-338,Granted Patent,no,0,6,3,3,0,B23K15/002;;C23C14/24,B23K15/00;;C23C14/24,C7F FEAA          EAA;;C7F F1V1          V;;C7F F6BX          V;;C7F F6B1C         V;;C7F F6B1Y         V;;C7F F6D1A1        V;;C7F F6D2          V,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The bottom wall supporting the passive radiator is preferably spaced a relatively short height above the floor by means of a plurality of legs such as four legs defining four output ports through which sound passes below the basic enclosure. The low frequency sound communicated through the four ports may be used to tune the resonator of the speaker system. With the use of the passive radiator maximum loading is obtained and interference effects are minimized. Also, upper base and mid-range internal reflections are prevented from being re-radiated. Because of the maximizing of loading a smaller passive radiator may be employed.

Wire feeds to a dancer pulley after which it is looped around the upper and lower pulleys in succession and departs tangentially from a pulley on its way to a wire processing machine which draws the wire. The carriage rises when there is an instantaneous increase in wire tension and an electric signal is produced whose magnitude corresponds to the amount of carriage movement. The motor responds to the signal by changing the motor and wire infeed speed to pay out wire at a rate which keeps the tension in the drawn wire constant.

    The inside out gas turbine cleaning method is a new method to clean axial gas turbine compressors. This is done by inserting a specially and fabricated flexible hose with nozzles on it into the first several stages of an off line gas turbine compressor. High pressure hot water with detergent is supplied to the hose and as it is withdrawn from the compressor it blasts dirt from the airfoil surfaces in the compressor. Conventional cleaning sprays water in one direction down the throat of the gas turbine compressor, whereas the this method cleans form the back forward giving a different blast angle with higher pressure water (see FIG. 1 ). Using both the conventional cleaning method and this new process, the compressor can be cleaned better allowing for improved gas turbine power and fuel efficiency.

    The inside out gas turbine cleaning method is a new method to clean axial gas turbine compressors. This is done by inserting a specially and fabricated flexible hose with nozzles on it into the first several stages of an off line gas turbine compressor. High pressure hot water with detergent is supplied to the hose and as it is withdrawn from the compressor it blasts dirt from the airfoil surfaces in the compressor. Conventional cleaning sprays water in one direction down the throat of the gas turbine compressor, whereas this method cleans from the back forward giving a different blast angle with higher pressure water (see FIG.  1  ). Using both the conventional cleaning method and this new process, the compressor can be cleaned better allowing for improved gas turbine power and fuel efficiency.

Optical apparatus for examining curved surfaces. ASSOCIATED ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES Ltd. Sept. 18, 1961 [Sept. 16, 1960], No. 31956/60. Class 97 (1). Optical apparatus for examining a curved surface comprises a first optical device adapted to reflect a light beam from a selected point on said surface through a right-angle along a reference line, means for indicating the position of the first optical device on the reference line and a second optical device adapted to reflect a light beam from the selected point through a known angle along the reference line, and means for indicating the position of the second optical device on the reference line. The apparatus is shown as applied to the examination of the paraboloidal surface 3 of a micro-wave aerial which is covered by a radome 4. It comprises a tube 2 attached to a container 7, the tube being mounted in apertures 5, 6 and the container being mounted in an aperture on a frame 8 so that the tube and container may be rotated together. Within the container 7 is an electric motor 17 driving a lead screw 12 to move axially of the reflector a carriage 15 for supporting a pentag prism 16. Also in the container 7 is a telescope 23 which is aligned with the reflector's axis. In order to determine the x co-ordinate of a point P marked on the reflecting surface 3, a right pentag 16 is placed on the carriage and the latter moved axially until an image of point P co-incides with the telescope cross-wires. By means of a suitably calibrated revolution counter 19 and dial 21, the x-co-ordinate of point P can then be read off. The pentag prism is then replaced by an angle pentag, which turns light rays, incident normally on one face thereof, through a known angle 0. Carriage 15 is again moved until the image of point P again coincides with the telescope cross-wires. The reading on the counter 19 and dial 21 then indicates the axial distance from the pole of the reflector at which a line drawn from P at an angle 0 to the reflector's axis will meet this axis, and the y-co-ordinate of point P may then be calculated. In this way, the x- and y-co-ordinates of several points P may be determined and by substitution of these values in the usual equation for a parabola (i.e. y<SP>2</SP>=4ax) it can be seen whether the surface is true and also an average value for the focal distance a can be calculated.",ASS ELECT IND,BUTLER GRAHAM JOHN,,https://lens.org/060-249-115-332-575,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,G01B11/255;;G01M11/005,G01B11/255,G2J J1B           J1B,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Such method embodies the steps of positioning a seal case member coated with a suitable bonding agent on a lower preheated mold core forming a portion of a mold cavity with said core having assembled thereto a negatively imprinted surface having a hydrodynamic fluted configuration at a preselected location; positioning a generally annular deformable and non-moldable solid material treated with a suitable bonding agent on the lower core of the mold situated so as to be in close proximity to the preselected location having the fluted imprinted surface; positioning a generally annular, uncured elastomeric material adjacent the deformable and non-moldable annulus which has a volume greater than the volume of a closed mold cavity; entrapping the elastomer, and deformable and non-moldable annulli and the seal case member by heating and compressing under pressure which is sufficient in magnitude to force portions of the deformable and non-moldable annulus onto the negatively imprint fluted surface by hydrostatic pressure generated by the elastomer being cured, such that a positive imprint is formed on the deformable non-moldable annulus which is generally complementary to the negatively imprinted surface on the seal mold; maintaining pressure and heat for a predetermined period of time to insure curing of the elastomeric annulus and the bonding agents to form a unitary radial lip seal having the deformable and non-moldable annulus bonded to the molded elastomeric annulus material with the latter being bonded to the seal case member; and removing the unitary molded seal member from the mold cavity.

    An electro-mechanical transducer, which provides beam patterns synthesized from the vibration modes of the transducer. A preferred form of the transducer is a short piezoelectric tube or ring with separate electrodes spaced around the ring for specific excitation of the monopole, dipole and quadrupole modes of vibration. Operation of the transducer in the region between the dipole and quadrupole modes yields a system with a nearly constant beam pattern and transmitting response. The arrangement allows a simple directional steered beam pattern from a single transducer.

The shells are driven by a ring or corresponding number of attached piezoelectric or magnetostrictive type rod or bar drivers which take the form of a regular polygon. The curved shells are attached to the ends of the driver and vibrate with magnified motion as the rods execute extensional motion. As the polygon expands the curved shells deform and produce additional motional in the same radial direction resulting in a large total displacement and corresponding large acoustic output.,IMAGE ACOUSTICS INC,BUTLER JOHN L,IMAGE ACOUSTICS INC (1986-05-30),https://lens.org/052-491-166-882-089,Granted Patent,yes,8,120,1,4,0,B06B1/085;;G10K9/121;;H04R17/08;;Y10S73/02;;G10K9/121;;B06B1/085;;H04R17/08;;Y10S73/02,B06B1/08;;G10K9/12;;H01L41/12;;H04R17/08,367/155;;367/156;;367/165;;367/168;;310/26;;310/334;;310/337;;381/190;;318/118;;X 73DIG 2,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Each section is capable of forcing a gas coolant through interpolar spaces which separate the poles on synchronous motors and generators. A flow guide is arranged in each interpolar space to direct the gas coolant against the adjacent field winding. One inboard section causes axial flow of the gas coolant through the interpolar spaces when the shaft of the dynamoelectric machine is rotated in a first direction and the other inboard section causes axial flow of the gas coolant in the opposite direction when the shaft is rotated in the second direction. The inboard sections are so designed that when they are rotating in their non-blowing direction of rotation, they extract minimum total pressure from the axially-propelled gas coolant forced towards them by the other inboard section and both outboard sections.

Juno 9. Vacuum tubes.- A vapour-lamp is made with two or more compartments containing different gases or vapours, and a regulating- device is provided for steadying the currents through these compartments. Mercury lamps are started by means of a filament t extending from the upper electrode into, or to within a short distance of, the mercury, and may be provided with a chamber containing an absor. bent of mercury vapour, such as gold or aluminium. The compartments may be formed by partitions within a glass or silica tube or bulb ; or they may be arranged one within the other as shown in Fig. 2. The inner tube k contains an electrode l of mercury or an alloy and an iron electrode m, while the annular space h contains a small quantity of a gas, the spectrum of which contains rays in which the spectrum of the mercury or alloy is deficient. When mercury or an amalgam of zinc, calcium, or the like is used, the gases of the argon family, especially helium, are used for correcting the colour of the light. Oxygen should be excluded. Radio-active substances may be used to increase the conductivity. Helium may also be introduced into the vapour compartment. The outer compartment may contain the mercury and the inner one the gas, if desired. A platinum or like wire n dips into the mercury l and is attached to a soft iron helix o, surrounding a glass tube m<1> containing the anode m. The magnetic lifting of the filament to strike the arc thus takes place within the tube itself. In another form, a series solenoid outside the tube attracts the helix o. The end of the wire n may be above the mercury l, in which case the arc can be started by shaking the tube ; or the coil o may be dispensed with and the wire merely extend from the electrode m into the mercury, which it vaporizes by radiation, especially if coiled into a spiral near its end. The outer chamber h is in series or parallel with the inner, and contains ring- shaped electrodes p of wire. For starting the discharge in this chamber, there may be provided a carbon filament or high-resistance wire p<1>, suspended from the upper electrode p and weighted so that it may be brought into contact with the lower one by tilting the tube. The absorbent for mercury vapour is placed in an extension y of the compartment k or in the compartment itself.

Butler, J., and Evans, J., [trading as Evans & Co., J.]. April 9. Casting and moulding.-Relates to the moulding of rice-bowls, and other flat hollow-ware, and consists mainly in means for attaching the runners to the patterns, which are used in conjunction with the frames described in Specification No. 8036, A.D. 1902. Fig. 11 shows a runner a, which has a projection fitting a recess in the plug d, in the bottom of the pattern. This plug is held in position by brackets e, and a plate f, and can be rotated, against the action of a spring, which returns it when set free. Before the runner is put in place, the opening in the plug is closed by a spring-pressed plunger g. The runner shown at k is used when the bowl is to be formed with a shallow boss as shown at m in Fig. 10. A boss n is formed on the pattern, and is connected to a plate p, secured to the pattern in the manner described above. Surrounding the boss is an annular plug s, in which are two recesses to receive projections q on the runner. An opening c is made in the runner to allow the sand to be rammed round the boss. The recesses in the plug are filled as before by spring-pressed plungers r, and the plug is provided with a spring as described above. The runners are made of some heavy metal or alloy, so that they fall out when the moulding box is inverted, and the frame y is rotated to remove the rollers z, as described in the previous Specification.",BUTLER JOHN;;EVANS JAMES,BUTLER JOHN;;EVANS JAMES,,https://lens.org/074-904-206-025-542,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The array of transceivers generate a multiplicity of electromagnetic wave fields between nearby units and detect the presence of intruders by detecting disturbances in these fields. The emitted UHF signals used to generate the electromagnetic wave fields are also used to provide the communication link between transceivers in the array and to a control station. The control station facilitates the operation of the array from a remote monitoring site. A unique method of array deployment provides multiple opportunities to detect an intruder and secondarily provides redundant communication links in case of a sensor failure.

Gas and explosive-vapour engines.-The engine comprises two explosion cylinders 1, 1<a> and one expansion cylinder 6 ; a four-stroke cycle is performed in the explosion cylinders, and the products from each alternately pass into the expansion cylinder, where they expand to below atmospheric pressure and draw a flushing-charge through the explosion cylinders. The crank of the cylinder 6 is about 190‹ in advance of those of the cylinders 1, 1<a>. Valves and valve gear; igniting.-All the distributing-valves are balanced in one piece and carried on a rotating shaft, driven by worm or chain and bevel gear from the crank shaft at a quarter its speed. They are of the kind described in Specifications No. 6990, A.D. 1890, and No. 24,881, A.D. 1896. The charge is supplied from an inspirator 15 described in these Specifications and in No. 15,598, A.D. 1887, and, after passing a throttle valve 15<a> controlled by a governor adjusted by a hand-wheel 18 and spring, is admitted through the ports 19, 20, 21, 22, or 22<a> to one of the cylinders 1, 1<a>. The exhaust passes through ports 24<a>, 24<b>, and 25 to the cylinder 6, and after expansion escapes into the atmosphere through ports 27 and the pipe 28. The air for flushing the cylinders is controlled by ports 29<a>, and passes by lateral pipes 31 containing non-return valves to the cylinders 1, 1<a>. The valve is slightly tapered, and because it expands during working it is secured between a spring 35 and a gland 34 which the valve tends to screw up as it rotates and so to slacken the valve ; the gland is provided with a turning-lever, and its motion is limited by a setscrew and stops. The valve may also control admission to two platinum igniting-tubes leading to clearance spaces in the brackets that secure them. Commutators 39, 39<a> for electric igniters 23, 23<a> may he carried on the valve shaft. Starting.-The apparatus is of the kind described in Specification No. 4604, A.D. 1895. A reservoir is charged with an explosive mixture by hand and ignited therein, the gases being admitted to one or both of the explosion cylinders through pipes 45 and valves 44 which open behind the pistons after they have performed about a quarter of their outstrokes. The reservoir may be charged with products from the cylinders for re-starting through these valves and pipes, the valves being arranged as both stop and non-return valves. The reservoir is in continuous communication with the explosion cylinder during starting, the gases being admitted in due course to the expansion cylinder. The admission of the starting-charges may be effected by the main valve. Steam may be used instead of burnt gases.",FURNEAUX JOHN BROKENSHIRE;;BUTLER EDWARD,FURNEAUX JOHN BROKENSHIRE;;BUTLER EDWARD,,https://lens.org/062-752-157-815-234,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Velocity measurements are taken e.g. by two pairs of sensors 11, 12 as the slider decelerates due to frictional resistance in the tube and a friction or resistance value is obtained from the deceleration value determined from the velocity measurements. The slider is chosen to have a mass that exerts a force similar to the typical tension on a fibre package during blown installation, and the sample of duct is held in a curved track to present maximum resistance.

Furaeaus, J. B., and Butler, E. July 7. Reversing - gearing .- Consists in improvements in the engine reversing- gear described in Specification No. 9203, A.D. 1889. In this gear, a frame carrying bevel wheels suitably geared with the driving and driven shafts is mounted so as to be capable of either being held stationary o r o f being rotated with the motor or driving shaft, with the result that, while the motor shaft runs on, the driven or propeller shaft accordingly revolves in one direction or the other. The present improvements c o m p r i s e brake apparatus for holding stationary and for revolving the nest of bevel wheels and in addition means for preventing the engine from racing when the bevelwheel frame is set free, and the gear is consequently out of action. As seen in Fig. 1, the motor shaft S<1> is in line with the propeller shaft S<2> and carries a flywheel W, which rotates near a stationary ring G formed on the fixed framing. Within these is mounted the nest of bevel wheels. The wheels are carried by a four-armed frame on which two pairs of brake blocks are mounted, one pair only B, B<2> being shown. These blocks are applied by pinion nuts P<1>, P<2>, which are adjusted by means of racks R<1> &c., so arranged that the frame can either be locked to the flywheel W or to the ring G, or may be set free from both. The adjustment is effected by a hand-lever L. In connection with this lever is arranged, as indicated in Fig. 4, gear for operating the engine regulator valve. The lever L when in the middle of its throw is in contact with a camlike lever L<2>, which operates the valve R, so as to prevent the engine from racing while the driving- gear is out of action.",FURNEAUX JOHN BROKENSHIRE;;BUTLER EDWARD,FURNEAUX JOHN BROKENSHIRE;;BUTLER EDWARD,,https://lens.org/146-398-293-283-128,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The method involves cleaning volatile components from the exposed surfaces of the medical device, removing carbon deposits and then applying a uniform carbon layer in a controlled environment. The deliberately applied carbon layer masks impurities of the underlying native oxide layer and leads to more uniform bioactive material coating not only a over the surfaces of a single medical device but also from device to device within a batch and between batches of devices. This improves production as well as optimising the amount and release of drug on the medical device without the need for a carrier material.

One end of the aperture is formed with a reduced diameter portion, while an end plug is inserted through the other end of the aperture so as to close it. The end plug includes a body portion sized to fit within the aperture and a head portion sized larger than the aperture. Prior to installing the end plug, a locking pin is slidably disposed in the aperture. The portion of the slidable locking pin which extends outwardly from the hub is inclined (relative to the radii of the hub and journal shaft) in a direction away from the direction of rotation of the hub.",DANA CORP,SIMPSON JOHN D;;BUTLER CHRISTOPHER C,HAYES-DANA INC.

The luminal surfaces of the medical device (100) are preferably coated with carbon, so as to have a low surface energy, which reduces the risk of thrombi forming when implanted into a patient's vessels. The abluminal surfaces are treated so as to have a high surface energy, such that a therapeutic, preferably bioactive, material, such as a drug, can adhere to the abluminal surfaces and preferably without any need for a containment layer such as polymer or other matrix material. Once the therapeutic material has been delivered into the tissue wall, the stent can remain within the patient's vessel without leaving any delivery artefacts, as occurs with some prior art drug eluting medical devices.

CONSTITUTION: When the temperature coefficient to resistance(TCRL) area is formed, a protection oxide to protect etching is laminated on an emitter polysilicon layer. Then, BF2 implanting substance is non-selectively implanted into the polysilicon layer. The substrate is covered with a protection oxide, a TCRL(141) is covered with a photo resist, and then it is etched by an appropriate size. The implantation to a resistor is activated during annealing at 900 deg.C, and the final doping shape of a bipolar device(200) and a MOS device is set.

SOLUTION: When a temperature coefficient to resistance (TCRL) area is formed, a protection oxide 140 to protect etching is laminated on an emitter polysilicon layer 132. Then, BF2 implanting substance 143 is non-selectively implanted into the polysilicon layer. Finally, the substrate is covered with a protection oxide, a TCRL 141 is covered with a photo resist, and then it is etched by an appropriate size. The implantation to a resistor is activated during annealing at 900 deg.C, and the final doping shape of a bipolar device 200 and a MOS device is set. Thus, an amorphous silicon film can be laminated, and its resistivity can be adjusted by adding a dopant.",INTERSIL CORP,HEMMENWAY DONALD;;DELGADO JOHN;;BUTLER JOHN;;ANTHONY RIVOLI,,https://lens.org/157-539-217-207-401,Patent Application,no,0,1,3,15,0,H01L21/763;;H01L21/8249;;H01L27/0635;;H01L28/20;;H01L28/20;;H01L21/763;;H01L27/0635;;H01L21/8249,H01C13/00;;H01C17/06;;H01L21/02;;H01L21/763;;H01L21/822;;H01L21/8222;;H01L21/8234;;H01L21/8248;;H01L21/8249;;H01L27/04;;H01L27/06,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The method involves cleaning volatile components from the exposed surfaces of the medical device, removing carbon deposits and then applying a uniform carbon layer in a controlled environment. The deliberately applied carbon layer masks impurities of the underlying native oxide layer and leads to more uniform bioactive material coating not only a over the surfaces of a single medical device but also from device to device within a batch and between batches of devices.

   An apparatus and method for pacifier withdrawal are disclosed. The apparatus comprises a plurality of successive pacifiers wherein each pacifier has a handle, a nipple connected to said handle, and a shield interposed between the handle and the nipple. Each successive pacifier has a nipple which is shorter in length than its predecessor. The invention may be practiced as a set of complete pacifiers, as a single pacifier with interchangeable nipples, or as a single pacifier having a nipple which retracts into the handle to shorten its exposed length. The method of using the pacifier withdrawal apparatus is to provide the infant with a first pacifier having a full length nipple and to allow the infant to use the first pacifier for a specified time period in order to become accustomed to it. The first pacifier is then withdrawn and replaced with a second pacifier having a nipple which is somewhat shorter than that of the first pacifier and the infant is allowed to use the second pacifier until he or she has become accustomed to the shorter nipple. The process of withdrawing the pacifier and replacing it with one having a shorter nipple is repeated until the infant has become accustomed to a final pacifier having a nipple with a minimal length. The final pacifier is then withdrawn without replacement.

The lip liner blank is an annular wafer having an annular groove (14) formed on one side (15) of the wafer at the point on the wafer where the wafer is intended to be split into two annular pieces (49, 50). A mold (32) is loaded with the lip liner blank (12), a prep ring of elastomeric material (43) and a seal case (44) and then closed thereby clamping the prep ring and wafer between upper and lower dies (40 and 36) of the mold. In the molding step the prep ring and wafer are heated and compressed causing the prep ring to become molten as it flows over the wafer. The molten elastomeric material enters the groove and pressure exerted by the elastomeric material against the groove splits the wafer into two annular pieces (49, 50). A first annular piece (49) is displaced in the mold to the desired location of the excluder lip (64). A second annular piece of the wafer lines the main lip (62) of the oil seal (10).",FEDERAL MOGUL CORP,BUTLER JOHN D;;CHANDLER JON A,"FEDERAL-MOGUL WORLD WIDE INC (1992-04-01);;FEDERAL-MOGUL CORPORATION (""FEDERAL-MOGUL"") A CORP.

The damaged portion raises the resistance and renders the resistor less sensitive to operating temperature fluctuations. A polysilicon thin film low temperature coefficient resistor and a method for the resistor's fabrication overcomes the coefficient of resistance problem of the prior art, while at the same time eliminating steps from the BiCMOS fabrication process, optimizing bipolar design tradeoffs, and improving passive device isolation. A low temperature coefficient of resistance resistor (TCRL) is formed on a layer of insulation, typically silicon dioxide or silicon nitride, the layer comprising polysilicon having a relatively high concentration of dopants of one or more species. An annealing process is used for the implanted resistor which is shorter than that for typical prior art implanted resistors, leaving some intentional unannealed damage in the resistor. The planned damage gives the TCRL a higher resistance without increasing its temperature coefficient. A process for fabrication of the resistor is used which combines separate spacer oxide depositions, provides buried layers having different diffusion coefficients, incorporates dual dielectric trench sidewalls that double as a polish stop, supplies a spacer structure that controls precisely the emitter-base dimension, and integrates bipolar and CMOS devices with negligible compromise to the features of either type.",INTERSIL CORP,HEMMENWAY DONALD;;DELGADO JOHN;;BUTLER JOHN;;RIVOLI ANTHONY,,https://lens.org/043-512-412-003-179,Patent Application,yes,0,1,10,15,0,H01L27/02;;H01L28/20;;H01L28/20;;H01L21/763;;H01L21/763;;H01L21/8249;;H01L21/8249;;H01L27/0635;;H01L27/0635,H01C7/00;;H01C13/00;;H01L21/02;;H01L21/265;;H01L21/3205;;H01L21/763;;H01L21/822;;H01L21/8222;;H01L21/8234;;H01L21/8248;;H01L21/8249;;H01L23/52;;H01L27/02;;H01L27/04;;H01L27/06,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The damaged portion raises the resistance and renders the resistor less sensitive to operating temperature fluctuations. A polysilicon thin film low temperature coefficient resistor and a method for the resistor's fabrication overcomes the coefficient of resistance problem of the prior art, while at the same time eliminating steps from the BiCMOS fabrication process, optimizing bipolar design tradeoffs, and improving passive device isolation. A low temperature coefficient of resistance resistor (TCRL) is formed on a layer of insulation, typically silicon dioxide or silicon nitride, the layer comprising polysilicon having a relatively high concentration of dopants of one or more species. An annealing process is used for the implanted resistor which is shorter than that for typical prior art implanted resistors, leaving some intentional unannealed damage in the resistor. The planned damage gives the TCRL a higher resistance without increasing its temperature coefficient. A process for fabrication of the resistor is used which combines separate spacer oxide depositions, provides buried layers having different diffusion coefficients, incorporates dual dielectric trench sidewalls that double as a polish stop, supplies a spacer structure that controls precisely the emitter-base dimension, and integrates bipolar and CMOS devices with negligible compromise to the features of either type.",INTERSIL CORP,HEMMENWAY DONALD;;DELGADO JOHN;;BUTLER JOHN;;RIVOLI ANTHONY,,https://lens.org/051-283-142-335-440,Search Report,yes,4,0,10,15,0,H01L27/02;;H01L28/20;;H01L28/20;;H01L21/763;;H01L21/763;;H01L21/8249;;H01L21/8249;;H01L27/0635;;H01L27/0635,H01C7/00;;H01C13/00;;H01L21/02;;H01L21/265;;H01L21/3205;;H01L21/763;;H01L21/822;;H01L21/8222;;H01L21/8234;;H01L21/8248;;H01L21/8249;;H01L23/52;;H01L27/02;;H01L27/04;;H01L27/06,,2,0,,,"PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN vol. 0092, no. 70 (E - 353) 26 October 1985 (1985-10-26);;PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN vol. 0072, no. 14 (E - 199) 21 September 1983 (1983-09-21)",DISCONTINUED

   An apparatus and method for pacifier withdrawal are disclosed. The apparatus comprises a plurality of successive pacifiers wherein each pacifier has a handle, a nipple connected to said handle, and a shield interposed between the handle and the nipple. Each successive pacifier has a nipple which is shorter in length than its predecessor. The invention may be practiced as a set of complete pacifiers, as a single pacifier with interchangeable nipples, or as a single pacifier having a nipple which retracts into the handle to shorten its exposed length. The method of using the pacifier withdrawal apparatus is to provide the infant with a first pacifier having a full length nipple and to allow the infant to use the first pacifier for a specified time period in order to become accustomed to it. The first pacifier is then withdrawn and replaced with a second pacifier having a nipple which is somewhat shorter than that of the first pacifier and the infant is allowed to use the second pacifier until he or she has become accustomed to the shorter nipple. The process of withdrawing the pacifier and replacing it with one having a shorter nipple is repeated until the infant has become accustomed to a final pacifier having a nipple with a minimal length. The final pacifier is then withdrawn without replacement.

The vent has an aperture 14 and an aperture cover 16 which during normal operation of the electronics is open and which during an explosion and an increase in pressure within housing 12 closes, operating thus as a smoke damper. The vent cover can be supported and held in its open position by single use, collapsible legs or other, manually resettable, support members 18 (see also fig 2 for an alternative, spring-based support). In the vent of a blast inside the chamber, the support elements deform and collapse or are dislodged, resulting in the shutter moving and closing the vent aperture, stopping thus the explosion gasses from escaping via the opening. The vent cover can be a single shutter (fig 1) or be formed of a vent plate (16) with openings (63, fig 3a) which when aligned with individual ventilation openings in the aperture (62), provide a ventilation path (64). In the event of an explosion, the vent plate is displaced sideways relative to the ventilation openings, blocking thus the entrance to the housing.",GENERAL ELECTRIC TECHNOLOGY GMBH,JOHN LEWIS OUTRAM;;STEPHEN DAVID BUTLER,,https://lens.org/169-614-093-430-398,Patent Application,no,8,0,7,7,0,H02B13/025;;H05K7/1432;;H01F27/025;;H05K5/0213;;H05K7/2089;;H05K5/0213;;H01H9/342;;H01H2009/343;;H01L23/051;;H02B1/565;;H02B13/025,H05K5/02;;H01F27/02;;H05K7/20,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

SOLUTION: A resistor is formed by using nonselective heavy ion BF2 implantation for doping a polysilicon layer. In a quick annealing stage of 900 deg.C, implantation into the resistor is activated and final doping shape is set for a bipolar device 200 and an MOS device 100. BF2 of high dose causes significant damage of polysilicon film and the damage is not annealed by short thermal annealing at a relatively low temperature (900 deg.C) in order to activate implantation. Damage of implantation forms an additional lapping site for carriers and increases resistance at a high implantation dose.",INTERSIL CORP,HEMMENWAY DONALD;;DELGADO JOHN;;BUTLER JOHN;;ANTHONY RIVOLI,,https://lens.org/043-806-222-119-860,Patent Application,no,0,0,10,15,0,H01L27/02;;H01L28/20;;H01L28/20;;H01L21/763;;H01L21/763;;H01L21/8249;;H01L21/8249;;H01L27/0635;;H01L27/0635,H01C7/00;;H01C13/00;;H01L21/02;;H01L21/265;;H01L21/3205;;H01L21/763;;H01L21/822;;H01L21/8222;;H01L21/8234;;H01L21/8248;;H01L21/8249;;H01L23/52;;H01L27/02;;H01L27/04;;H01L27/06,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The hub has a central longitudinal passageway formed therethrough which is co-axial with the axis of rotation. An aperture is formed completely through the hub in a direction which is generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the hub. The aperture extends at least partially through the passageway formed in the hub. One end of the aperture is formed with a reduced diameter portion, while an end plug is inserted through the other end of the aperture so as to close it. The end plug includes a body portion sized to fit within the aperture and a head portion sized larger than the aperture. The body portion includes an enlarged diameter portion formed thereon which is slightly larger than the inner diameter of the aperture so as to be frictionally engaged thereby. The enlarged diameter portion may be formed as a circumferential projection, or alternatively as a thread. The head portion of the end plug is formed integrally with the body portion to permit rotation thereof during and after insertion. The enlarged diameter portion cuts a shallow groove in the hub during such rotation to securely retain the end plug therein. Prior to installing the end plug, a locking pin is slidably disposed in the aperture. The journal shaft is provided with a groove in the exterior surface thereof to receive the locking pin therein. When the locking pin is inserted through the hub aperture and the journal shaft groove, it prevents the removal of the journal shaft from the hub. The locking pin includes a recessed portion which, when aligned with the groove, permits the journal shaft to be removed from the hub. A spring is provided to urge the locking pin to a position wherein the recess therein is not aligned with the journal shaft groove, thus normally preventing the removal of the journal shaft from the hub. The portion of the slidable locking pin which extends outwardly from the hub is inclined (relative to the radii of the hub and journal shaft) in a direction away from the direction of rotation of the hub.",WALTERSCHEID AGMASTER INC,SIMPSON JOHN D;;BUTLER CHRISTOPHER C,,https://lens.org/166-796-176-377-888,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,F16D1/116;;Y10T403/602;;Y10T403/598;;F16D3/387;;F16D2001/103;;Y10T403/602;;Y10T403/598;;F16D1/116,F16D1/116,64-20,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

NATIONAL ACME CO. Oct. 10, 1956, No. 30883/56. Class 83 (3). As described with reference to a six-spindle turret-lathe, bar-stock is machined at one end in positions 1, 3, 5 of the turret, is removed from spindle 5, reversed, and inserted in spindle 6, the other end of the work being completed at positions 2, 4, and the finished work being ejected at position 6. At position 5 (spindle 18, Fig. 3), the work 20 is engaged by rollers 28, 29, 31, the two former carried by a block 24 pivoted at 26 on a holder 16, and the latter carried by a block 25 pivoted at 27. Springs 30, 32 press the rollers towards the work 20. Holder 16 has a shank 23 pivoted in a member 15 attachable to a cross-slide 12 of the lathe, the action being such that on completion of machining in spindle 18, the slide 12 is advanced, a pin 37 on block 25 engaging a fixed cam 38 to lower roller 31 and allow the rollers to embrace the work and support it during cutting- off by a tool 11. The holder 16 is then rotated about its shank 23, through a pinion 40 on the shank engaged by a rack 41 operated by a rod 42 actuated from a cam (not shown), by a lever 43 and cushioning springs 44, the work being thereby inverted and brought opposite spindle 19, into which it is pushed by a camoperated rod 49. The holder 16 and slide 12 are then withdrawn and the holder oscillated to its original position in relation to spindle 18. The closure of the rollers is limited by stops 33, 34 in blocks 24, 25 engaging screws 36, 35 in the holder. The spring 44, Fig. 1, assists alignment of the rollers by allowing the rack limited-free movement, and screws 45, 46, Fig. 3, on the holder contact stops 47, 48 to effect alignment of the holder with the spindles 18, 19 respectively.
