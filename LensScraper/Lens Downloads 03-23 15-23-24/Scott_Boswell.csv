Elastic material comprises compartment providing support structure and product compartment, wherein said elastic material comprises first laminate and second laminate connected with at least part of first laminate by at least one fastening. First laminate comprises first gas-impermeable layer arranged between first and second fixed layers, wherein first and second secured layers make opposite outer layers of first laminate. Second laminate comprises third attached layer making outer layer of second laminate, and second gas-impermeable layer. At least one attachment connects fixed part of third layer with at least part of second fixed layer for formation of at least one boundary, which provides compartment support structure, which is located between first and second laminates. Elastic material is characterised by gas permeability from 0.05 cm/m·day·atm to 18 cm/m·day·atm in area forming compartment support structure.EFFECT: invention provides creation of container for fluid products functional and technological in production.20 cl, 58 dwg, 8 ex",PROCTER & GAMBLE,STANLEY SCOTT KENDYL;;YOU JUN;;BOSWELL EMILY CHARLOTTE;;ARENT LEE MATHEW,,https://lens.org/050-431-597-931-05X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,118,183,0,B32B7/12;;B32B27/08;;B32B27/306;;B32B27/32;;B32B27/327;;B32B27/34;;B32B27/36;;B65D31/16;;B65D33/004;;B65D33/02;;B65D75/008;;B65D75/525;;B65D75/54;;B32B2307/31;;B32B2307/7246;;B32B2307/7244;;B32B2307/7242;;B32B2270/00;;B32B2250/24;;B32B2255/10;;B32B2439/40;;B32B2439/70;;B65D75/5883;;B65D75/5877;;B65D75/5866;;B65D75/20;;B65D75/566;;B32B7/12;;B32B27/306;;B32B27/32;;B32B27/327;;B32B27/34;;B32B27/36;;B65D75/008;;B65D75/525;;B65D75/54;;B65D33/004;;B65D75/5883;;B32B2250/24;;B32B2255/10;;B32B2270/00;;B32B2307/31;;B32B2307/7242;;B32B2307/7244;;B32B2307/7246;;B32B2439/40;;B32B2439/70;;B65D75/20;;B65D75/566;;B65D31/16;;B65D75/5866;;B65D75/5877;;B65D33/02;;Y10T428/24942;;Y10T428/31913;;Y10T428/31746;;Y10T428/31797;;B32B27/08;;B32B2307/54;;B32B2307/548;;B32B3/12;;B32B7/02;;B32B7/12;;B32B27/08;;B32B27/20;;B32B37/10;;B65D33/00;;B65D75/52;;B32B27/306;;B32B27/327;;B32B27/34;;B32B27/36;;B65D33/008;;B65D75/008;;B65D75/5883;;B65D75/5894;;B65D81/3288;;B32B27/325;;B65D31/16;;B65D31/18;;B65D75/525;;B65D75/5866;;Y10S383/906;;B32B2307/54;;B32B2307/548;;B32B2307/31;;B32B2307/7244;;B32B2250/24;;B32B2255/10;;B32B2270/00;;B32B2439/40;;B32B27/08;;B65D75/00;;B65D75/58;;B65D31/00;;B32B27/34;;B32B27/32;;B32B27/30;;B65D85/00;;Y10T428/24942;;Y10T428/31913;;Y10T428/31746;;Y10T428/31797;;B65D27/00;;B65D37/00;;B65D33/02;;B32B7/12;;B32B27/306;;B32B27/32;;B32B27/327;;B32B27/34;;B32B27/36;;B65D75/008;;B65D75/525;;B65D75/54;;B65D33/004;;B65D75/5883;;B32B2250/24;;B32B2255/10;;B32B2270/00;;B32B2307/31;;B32B2307/7242;;B32B2307/7244;;B32B2307/7246;;B32B2439/40;;B32B2439/70;;B65D75/20;;B65D75/566;;B65D31/16;;B65D75/5866;;B65D75/5877;;B32B1/00;;B65D25/14;;B65D1/42;;B65D21/0201;;B65D35/10;;B65D31/00;;B32B27/08;;B32B27/30,B32B27/08;;B32B27/30;;B32B27/32;;B32B27/34;;B65D30/00,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

Such drill pipe may comprise cavities therein for working units such as motors, generators, solenoids and the like. It may be desirable to lubricate and cool such working units with water from the drilling fluid, however, mud particulate may damage such devices. The present invention comprises various embodiments of a dynamic seal assembly designed to allow fluid communication between a cavity and a fluid flow while blocking certain particulate matter within the fluid flow from entering the cavity.

    The guard tour system of the present invention is comprised of a central computer which runs a computer program that enables a variety of electronic hardware components to function as the guard tour system. As a guard progresses through a guard tour, he or she uses a touch button reader to read information stored within a plurality of touch memory buttons located along the patrol route. At the end of the patrol, the guard places the touch button reader in a downloader that transfers the stored data to the central computer which processes the data and generates reports summarizing the patrol data. The computer program of the present invention provides a novel method of organizing security information in heirarchical categories. Further, the guard tour system of the present invention uses a novel method to determine the number of times a guard visited a location in a given time period.

   The above discussed and other drawbacks and deficiencies of the prior art are overcome or alleviated by an all-wheel steering system for a vehicle comprising a controller having a first input for receiving a signal from a hand wheel position sensor, a second input for receiving a signal from a vehicle speed sensor, and a third input for receiving a signal that varies depending upon whether a trailer is hitched to said vehicle. The controller generates an output for controlling a rear wheel steering actuator. The output varies as a function of the first, second, and third inputs such that when a trailer is hitched to said vehicle the out-of-phase rear steer amount at low speeds is reduced and the in-phase rear steering amount at high speeds is increased.
