The system includes a pair of spaced contact receivers that limit the travel of a contactor. The system provides a flat linear response at low frequencies as the contact receivers are intermittently or occasionally contacted by the contactor during operation of the loudspeaker. The system enables creation of different regions of non-linearity within a total stiffness versus deflection curve of a loudspeaker suspension system. The non-linearity in each region can be controlled individually, so long as the non-linearity by region increases moving away from the rest position. Thus, a plateau of substantially linear stiffness may extend for a large portion of the total displacement allowed for a voice coil and suspension components before a region of non-linear stiffness occurs only at the ends of an allowable excursion to limit the motion. More than two regions of stiffness also can be created to achieve maximum performance and stability.",BOSCH GMBH ROBERT,BABB ALAN;;GRUNLOH ANDREW;;CARLSON DAVID,,https://lens.org/021-478-989-930-693,Patent Application,yes,4,0,7,7,0,H04R9/043;;H04R9/06;;H04R7/127;;H04R7/18;;H04R9/025;;H04R9/045;;H04R9/06;;H04R2400/11,H04R9/04,,0,0,,,,PENDING

   Systems, kits, and methods for establishing vascular access are described. A system may include a needle, a radially expandable sleeve and a dilator. The methods include creating an initial tissue tract to a target blood vessel with a radially expandable sleeve mounted on a needle. Upon removal of the needle, the dilator is then passed through the radially expandable sleeve to effect radial expansion of the sleeve. Use of the sleeve reduces the risk of injuring tissue surrounding the tissue tract by lessening the axial forces imparted to the tissue. Kits comprise at least the radially expandable sleeve together with instructions for use.

A custom forms feature allows a user to create and share custom forms without requiring the form to be published or installed by other user. The custom form's attributes are transmitted to the recipient as an element of the e-mail message. An autoresponse feature allows a sender to create a message that includes voting buttons corresponding to the possible responses to a query. A recipient replies by selecting one of the voting buttons. The recipient's vote is automatically tallied in the sender's copy of the message, thus allowing the sender to view a vote tally, a list of the recipients, and their response.

The system enables creation of different regions of non-linearity within a total stiffness versus deflection curve of a loudspeaker suspension system. The non-linearity in eachregion can be controlled individually, so long as the non-linearity by region increases moving away from the rest position. Thus, a plateau of substantially linear stiffness may extend for a large portion of the total displacement allowed for a voice coil and suspension components before a region of non-linear stiffness occurs only at the ends of an allowable excursion to limit the motion.

The hydroxides may be NaOH, KOH, or LiOH. As shown, electrolytic cell liquor is concentrated in the evaporator to 40-55% NaOH and crystallized NaCl is removed. The resulting liquor passes to storage 1 and thence to ammonia extraction column 3, whence pure NaOH containing a small amount of NH3 is withdrawn at the bottom. The lighter ammonia phase passes to still bottom storage. The ammonia phase is concentrated in the evaporator to 40-55% NaOH and crystallized NaCl is removed. The concentrated ammonia phase is mixed with NaOH, preferably concentrated feed liquor, to reduce the ratio of chlorate to hydroxide to 0,9-5 lbs. chlorate/100 lbs. NaOH, to prevent contamination of the subsequent hydroxide phase with chlorate, and the resulting mixture is fed to the ammonia extraction column, whence a further purified NaOH phase is recovered at the bottom. The second ammonia phase is partly discarded and the balance may be recycled to ammonia treatment, or mixed with NaOH for further use. Alternatively, the second ammonia phase may be concentrated to 40-55% NaOH and chlorate crystallized therefrom at below 30 DEG C.

The high-pressure purging assembly is located at the rear end of the heating assembly, the high-pressure purging assembly can conduct purging on the portion, where residual zinc is removed, of the anchor rod, the residual zinc adhering to the surface of the anchor rod is forced to be separated from the surface of the anchor rod, and after the anchor rod is subjected to hot-dip galvanizing treatment or quality inspection, the anchor rod is subjected to hot-dip galvanizing treatment. After the anchor rod is heated, a zinc coating on the surface of the anchor rod is melted, redundant zinc liquid in a screw thread is blown away through high-speed gas of the high-pressure blowing assembly, and therefore it is guaranteed that the interior of the thread is smooth, and the problem that a nut is difficult to screw in due to the residual zinc liquid is solved; and redundant zinc liquid directly falls back into the collecting tank, so that the loss amount of zinc is reduced, and rapid repair is carried out after the problem that excessive residual zinc is found after the anchor rod is subjected to hot-dip galvanizing treatment is solved.",ZHEJIANG PRETEC METAL PRODUCTS CO LTD,EVAN ANDREW CARLSON;;TANG ZHUOYUN;;GU JIANBO;;SHI JIE,,https://lens.org/127-383-861-254-43X,Limited Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,,C23C2/06;;C23C2/18,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The system includes a pair of spaced contact receivers that limit the travel of a contactor. The system provides a flat linear response at low frequencies as the contact receivers are intermittently or occasionally contacted by the contactor during operation of the loudspeaker. The system enables creation of different regions of non-linearity within a total stiffness versus deflection curve of a loudspeaker suspension system. The non-linearity in each region can be controlled individually, so long as the non-linearity by region increases moving away from the rest position. Thus, a plateau of substantially linear stiffness may extend for a large portion of the total displacement allowed for a voice coil and suspension components before a region of non-linear stiffness occurs only at the ends of an allowable excursion to limit the motion. More than two regions of stiffness also can be created to achieve maximum performance and stability.",BOSCH GMBH ROBERT,BABB ALAN J;;GRUNLOH ANDREW M;;CARLSON DAVID E,BOSCH SECURITY SYSTEMS INC (2017-02-07);;ROBERT BOSCH GMBH (2017-02-07),https://lens.org/146-387-102-827-433,Granted Patent,yes,17,0,7,7,0,H04R9/043;;H04R9/045;;H04R7/127;;H04R7/18;;H04R9/025;;H04R9/06;;H04R9/06;;H04R2400/11,H04R9/04;;H04R7/12;;H04R7/18;;H04R9/02;;H04R9/06,,3,0,,,"International Search Report and the Written Opinion of the International Searching Authority, dated Jun. 14, 2017; Intl.

   In an electronic mail system environment, a system and method for automatically checking recipients' names, providing message flags, providing custom forms, and providing an autoresponse feature. Recipients' names are resolved in the background, while the user of the e-mail system is composing the message. The user easily resolves ambiguous names by using a context menu. The resolved ambiguous names are automatically used to create nicknames, which are used to resolve ambiguous names in the future. Message flags allow a sender or recipient to identify required follow-up action and a deadline. The recipient may use the message flags to quickly determine which messages require follow-up action. The e-mail system notifies a recipient when a due date is approaching or when a follow-up action is past due. A custom forms feature allows a user to create and share custom forms without requiring the form to be published or installed by other user. The custom form's attributes are transmitted to the recipient as an element of the e-mail message. An autoresponse feature allows a sender to create a message that includes voting buttons corresponding to the possible responses to a query. A recipient replies by selecting one of the voting buttons. The recipient's vote is automatically tallied in the sender's copy of the message, thus allowing the sender to view a vote tally, a list of the recipients, and their response.

The system includes a pair of spaced contact receivers that limit the travel of a contactor. The system provides a flat linear response at low frequencies as the contact receivers are intermittently or occasionally contacted by the contactor during operation of the loudspeaker. The system enables creation of different regions of non-linearity within a total stiffness versus deflection curve of a loudspeaker suspension system. The non-linearity in each region can be controlled individually, so long as the non-linearity by region increases moving away from the rest position. Thus, a plateau of substantially linear stiffness may extend for a large portion of the total displacement allowed for a voice coil and suspension components before a region of non-linear stiffness occurs only at the ends of an allowable excursion to limit the motion. More than two regions of stiffness also can be created to achieve maximum performance and stability.",BOSCH GMBH ROBERT,BABB ALAN J;;GRUNLOH ANDREW M;;CARLSON DAVID E,BOSCH SECURITY SYSTEMS INC (2017-02-07);;ROBERT BOSCH GMBH (2017-02-07),https://lens.org/082-137-811-906-351,Patent Application,yes,0,0,7,7,0,H04R9/043;;H04R9/045;;H04R7/127;;H04R7/18;;H04R9/025;;H04R9/06;;H04R9/06;;H04R2400/11,H04R9/04;;H04R7/12;;H04R7/18;;H04R9/02;;H04R9/06,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

    A Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver employs variable spacing of Doppler offset bins and code offset bins when acquiring a P(Y) code, to improve signal acquisition characteristics with respect to a search region having a plurality of Doppler offset bins and code offset bins. The receiver includes an acquisition module in which an input signal representative of a received P(Y) code is received and applied to a first programmable rate mixer. An output of the first programmable rate mixer is applied to a combiner, which selectively combines samples of the input signal based on a control input to dynamically determine the spacing of the code offset bins. An output of the combiner is normalized and applied to a correlation unit, which generates correlation measures of the received P(Y) code and a locally generated P(Y) code. A signal representative of the correlation measures is applied separately to each of a set of programmable rate mixers and mixed with separate mixing signals.

   A cardiac rhythm management system provides a phonocardiographic image indicative of a heart's mechanical events related to hemodynamic performance to allow, among other things, diagnosis of cardiac conditions and evaluation of therapies treating the cardiac conditions. The phonocardiographic image includes a stack of acoustic sensor signal segments representing multiple cardiac cycles. Each acoustic sensor signal segment includes heart sounds indicative of the heart's mechanical events and representations of the heart's electrical events. The diagnosis and/or therapy evaluation are performed by observing or detecting at least an occurrence of a particular heart sound related to a cardiac time interval or a trend of a particular time interval between an electrical event and a mechanical event over the cardiac time interval.

Computers; data storage protection. BURROUGHS CORP. 30 Aug., 1968 [25 Sept., 1967], No. 41510/68. Headings G4A and G4C. In a data processing system, a word is read from a location of an addressable memory into a first buffer register and transferred therefrom to a processor, a word supplied to a second buffer register by the processor being written into the same location. A processor communicates with a plurality of memory units over a common bus, each memory unit having an addressable random-access memory and two buffer registers. The processor supplies a word to be written into one of the memories, to its second buffer, and supplies the memory word address, the addressed word being read out into the first buffer. If a memory protect signal is present from the processor, a protect bit of the word in the first buffer is tested and if it is set the contents of the first buffer are restored into the memory. If it is not set, the contents of the second buffer are stored into the addressed memory location. If the memory protect signal from the processor is not present, the contents of the second buffer are stored into the addressed memory location. In any case, the contents of the first buffer are supplied to a register in the processor where the protect bit is tested. If it is set, interrupt occurs with branch to a fix-up routine and an alarm is given. If it is not set, an operation complete signal is produced.

    A method utilizes sputter transport techniques to produce arrays or layers of self-forming, self-oriented columnar structures characterized as discrete, single-crystal Group III nitride posts or columns on various substrates. The columnar structure is formed in a single growth step, and therefore does not require processing steps for depositing, patterning, and etching growth masks. A Group III metal source vapor is produced by sputtering a target, for combination with nitrogen supplied from a nitrogen-containing source gas. The III/V ratio is adjusted or controlled to create a Group III metal-rich environment within the reaction chamber conducive to preferential column growth. The reactant vapor species are deposited on the growth surface to produce single-crystal M ^{ III } N columns thereon. The columns can be employed as a strain-relieving platform for the growth of continuous, low defect-density, bulk materials. Additionally, the growth conditions can be readjusted to effect columnar epitaxial overgrowth, wherein coalescence of the Group III nitride material occurs at the tops of the columns, thereby forming a substantially continuous layer upon which additional layers can be deposited. The intervening presence of the column structure mitigates thermal mismatch stress between substrates, films, or other layers above and below the columns. A high deposition rate sputter method utilizing a non-thermionic electron/plasma injector assembly is provided to carrying out one or more of the growth steps.

The Envelope has its own user interface that is fully functional within the confines of the document editor's user interface to provide the user with the functionality of the email client application program. With the Envelope invoked, the user is enabled to execute many of the email client's functions while still editing the document within the document editor's user interface. Thus, the rich document editing functionality of the document editor is maintained, while the functionality of the email client is simultaneously accessible to the user. Envelope data generated during the editing process is saved with the document and available when the document is next edited or is opened as an email message.

BURROUGHS CORP. 30 Aug., 1968 [18 Sept., 1967], No. 41511/68. Heading G4A. In a data processor, an information item is handled in accordance with the value of a tag in the item which specifies if it has one or a plurality of words. The top two stages of a last-in-first-out stack each consist of two one-word registers, the rest of the stack being a series of consecutive wordlocations in a core memory the top-most of which is addressed by an S-register. Operands stored in the stack each consist of one or two words each word having a (3-bit) tag to indicate which (or in the case of 2-word operands only the more significant word may have the tag). An instruction address counter addresses the memory to obtain successive operators which operate on the top of the stack treating the operands as single or double word (precision) according to their tags. An ADD operator moves up the stack if necessary, until the top two stages are occupied with respective operands, then performs floating-point addition on the operands by a conventional algorithm which omits unnecessary steps in the case of one or two zero mantissas or equal exponents, the result being stored in the second stage. A parallel adder is provided, fed serially by word in the case of 2-word operands. A LOAD operator pushes down the stack until the top stage is empty (if either of the top two stages is initially empty, the memoryportion of the stack is not interfered with), then addresses the memory from a buffer register to obtain an operand to load into the top stage. A STORE operator moves up the stack if necessary, until the top stage is occupied (if the second stage is initially occupied, and thus can provide the operand for the top stage, or if the top stage is already occupied, the memoryportion of the stack is not interfered with). The top stage operand is then inserted into a memory address or addresses specified by the buffer register. In this, if the operand from the stack is of one word and the address it is bring transferred to is part of a two-word operand, the operand from the stack is converted to two-word form. Conversely a twoword stack operand is rounded-off to a oneword operand if the address it is being transferred to holds a one-word operand. In either case the tags are updated. Polish notation in which the operator follows the operands is mentioned.",BURROUGHS CORP,BARTON ROBERT STANLEY;;CARLSON CARL BERNARD;;CREECH BOBBY ANDREW;;DENT BENJAMIN ALBERT;;HAUK ERWIN ARTHUR,,https://lens.org/193-021-048-755-835,Granted Patent,no,0,0,4,4,0,G06F9/30192;;G06F12/04,G06F9/318;;G06F12/04,G4A AVL           VL;;G4A A1D           F;;G4A A1D           VL;;G4A A1F           F;;G4A A1F           VL;;G4A A13E          F;;G4A A13E          VL;;G4A A15A2         F;;G4A A15A2         VL;;G4A A16C          F;;G4A A16C          VL;;G4A A16EY         F;;G4A A16EY         VL;;G4A A16E2         F;;G4A A16E2         VL;;G4A A2BY          F;;G4A A2BY          VL;;G4A A2F11         F;;G4A A2F11         VL;;G4A A2F3          F;;G4A A2F3          VL;;G4A A2F5          F;;G4A A2F5          VL;;G4A A2F6          F;;G4A A2F6          VL;;G4A A3W2          F;;G4A A3W2          VL;;G4A A6M1          F;;G4A A6M1          VL;;G4A A8C           F;;G4A A8C           VL,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In one embodiment, the solar cell is comprised of a high energy gap cell stack and a dichroic mirror. The high energy gap cell stack is exposed to solar light before there is any splitting of the solar light into spectral components. Each cell in the high energy gap cell stack absorbs the light with photons of energy greater than or equal to its energy gap, i.e., the blue-green to ultraviolet portion of the solar light. Each cell in the high energy gap cell stack is transparent to and transmits light with photons of energy less than its energy gap. Spectral splitting is then performed by means of the dichroic mirror on the remaining light, i.e., the light transmitted by the high energy gap cell stack.",BARNETT ALLEN M;;CARLSON DAVID EMIL;;DOOLITTLE WILLIAM ALAN;;HONSBERG CHRISTIANA BEATRICE;;KIRKPATRICK DOUGLAS ANDREW,BARNETT ALLEN M;;CARLSON DAVID EMIL;;DOOLITTLE WILLIAM ALAN;;HONSBERG CHRISTIANA BEATRICE;;KIRKPATRICK DOUGLAS ANDREW,,https://lens.org/116-874-223-523-110,Patent Application,yes,2,8,17,17,0,G02B27/1006;;G02B27/14;;H01L31/0687;;Y02E10/52;;Y02E10/544;;H01L31/0549;;Y02E10/547;;H01L31/04;;G02B27/1006;;G02B27/14;;Y02E10/544;;H01L31/0687;;Y02E10/52;;H01L31/0549,H01L31/052,136/246,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
