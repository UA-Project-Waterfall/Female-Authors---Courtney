To forecast an ETR, the collection of information from the multiple sources may be provided as inputs to a machine learning model, such as a deep long-short term memory recurrent neural network, a predictive model, and/or the like. The machine learning model may be trained to optimize the temporal cost function of sustained service interruptions and forecast ETRs for service interruptions (in minutes). The machine learning model may process data/information in real-time and provide an ETR when inputs are not yet available in the repair/resolution process, and update (reforecast) the ETR in real-time as the inputs late become available.",COMMONWEALTH EDISON COMPANY,CHATTERON CARL;;WILSON DAVID;;BURGOS SARAH;;ORLEDGE TRACY;;BELBER SUZANNE;;BESHARATI BABAK;;ANDERSON VLADYSLAV,,https://lens.org/179-737-434-744-268,Patent Application,yes,18,0,1,1,0,G06Q10/20;;G06Q10/20;;G06Q10/063114;;G06Q50/06,G06Q10/00,,2,0,,,"Olah, Christopher ""Understanding LSTM Networks"" August 27, 2015, https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/ (Year: 2015);;Brownlee, Jason ""How to Develop LSTM Models for Time Series Forecasting"", August 28, 2020, https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-lstm-models-for-time-series-forecasting/ (Year: 2020)",PENDING
