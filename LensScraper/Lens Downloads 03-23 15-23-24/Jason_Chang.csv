This means the magnetic lock means (1, 2) may be manufactured to be smaller and use less power as it does not have to resist the full force of unauthorised opening. The mechanical lock means includes a pin (24) and at least one locking element (27) which operates by engagement of the at least one locking element with a recess (24). When the magnetic lock means (1, 2), such as an electromagnet (1) and armature (2), is energised movement of the door in the frame (Large arrow) causes the movement of the pin (24) and the electromagnet (1) relative a sleeve (42) around the pin (24). This in turn allows locking balls (27) to enter a groove (26) in the pin and prevent further movement of the lock (10) as a whole by abutting a shoulder (41) that moves with the electromagnet (1) restricting the position of the balls (27) so they must engage the pin. This interaction prevents further movement of the door. When not energised the electromagnet (1) is not attracted to the armature (2) and any movement of the door leaves it in place preventing the balls (27) from locking the pin (24) in the sleeve (42).",SHANGHAI ONE TOP CORP,CHANG JASON,,https://lens.org/002-088-805-841-563,Patent Application,no,0,1,18,18,0,E05B47/00;;E05C19/166;;E05C19/166;;E05B17/22;;E05B17/22;;E05B45/083;;E05B45/083;;E05B63/121;;E05B63/121;;E05B65/10;;E05C17/56;;E05C17/56;;Y10T292/11;;Y10T292/11,E05B47/00;;E05B15/12;;E05B17/20;;E05B63/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Noise generated by analog-to-digital converters is filtered from a pixel of digital image data. Moreover, the effects of single pixel defects in the imager are eliminated by clamping a predetermined pixel of image data within the window when the value of the predetermined pixel is greater than a maximum value of the image data of neighboring pixels or less than a minimum value of the image data of neighboring pixels. Ripples in image data are reduced by eliminating the effects of single pixel defects before filtering for crosstalk caused by electrical crosstalk between sensor elements in an imager. Dark current is removed from image data generated by an imager by subtracting a fraction of a determined dark current value from all image data generated by the imager to compensate for nonlinearities in dark current across the imager. The image data is white balanced by creating a set of scalar color adjustments from determined average color values and constraining the set of scalar adjustments to plausible lighting conditions to prevent overcompensation on images having large regions of similar hue. Lastly, utilization of a fixed set of intensity levels is optimized by remapping and restreching the image data to create new luma values for each pixel.",SENSATA TECHNOLOGIES INC,SODINI CHARLES G;;SPROUL JASON Y;;CHANG EDWARD T,SMAL CAMERA TECHNOLOGIES (2004-02-27),https://lens.org/068-953-737-922-860,Granted Patent,yes,3,80,1,1,0,G06T5/40;;H04N5/21;;H04N23/71;;H04N23/73;;H04N25/575;;H04N25/63;;H04N25/683;;H04N25/76;;H04N23/88;;G06T5/92;;G06T5/40;;H04N5/21;;H04N23/71;;H04N23/73;;H04N23/88;;H04N25/63;;H04N25/76;;H04N25/575;;H04N25/683;;G06T5/92,G06K9/00,382/168;;345/589,3,1,009-406-602-689-659,10.1109/4.735551,"""A 256x256 CMOS Imaging Array with Side Dynamic Range Pixels and Column-Parallel Digital Output,"" Decker et al.

Next, a laser texturing process is performed to produce a textured annular landing zone on the disk substrate. A magnetic layer is then formed on the disk substrate to complete the fabrication process. However, abnormal asperity usually remains on the surface of the disk substrate. Further, as the amount of exposure time in the air increases, an oxide film is inevitably formed on the surface of the disk substrate. Both of them degrade the surface smooth of the disk substrate, resulting in poor control of the size and structure of the laser texture. In addition, due to the irregular distribution of the mechanical polished texture on the disk substrate, a subsequently formed magnetic layer can not easily achieve the desired properties. This invention therefore provides a light texture process for fabricating a magnetic recording medium. The process is characterized in forming light textures by a two-step light texturing process before forming the laser texture on a disk substrate. The process is intended to remove abnormal asperity and oxide film on the disk substrate, as well as form a plurality of circumferential light textures on the surface of the disk substrate. The roughness of the circumferential light textures is less than that of the laser texture. As the surface smooth of the disk substrate is improved, the size and structure of the laser texture are more controllable. Furthermore, it is easier to form a magnetic layer having desired properties because the circumferential light textures are distributed in a regular way.",TRACE STORAGE TECHNOLOGY CORP,LIN CHENG-DER;;LIN JASON S;;CHANG YUAN-MING;;TAN AN-HUNG,TRACE STORAGE TECHNOLOGY CORP (1997-10-28),https://lens.org/098-730-745-792-189,Granted Patent,yes,2,18,4,4,0,G11B5/8404;;G11B5/8404;;G11B5/73913;;G11B5/73913;;G11B5/73919;;G11B5/73919;;G11B5/8408;;G11B5/8408;;Y10S428/90;;Y10S428/90;;Y10T428/24355;;Y10T428/24355,G11B5/82;;G11B5/73;;G11B5/84,428/141;;X428694 TR;;X428694 SG;;428/900;;427/129;;427/508;;427/510;;364/474.06;;364/474.08,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Novel methodologies and systems segment and define accurate endoluminal surfaces in airway trees, including small peripheral bronchi. An automatic algorithm is described that searches the entire lung volume for airway branches and poses airway-tree segmentation as a global graph-theoretic optimization problem. A suite of interactive segmentation tools for cleaning and extending critical areas of the automatically segmented result is disclosed. A model path is reconstructed through the airway tree. Additionally, a computer-based system for automatically locating the central chest lymph -node stations in a 3D MDCT image is described. Automated analysis methods extract the airway tree, airway-tree centerlines, aorta, pulmonary artery, lungs, key skeletal structures, and major-airway labels. Geometrical and anatomical cues arising from the extracted structures are used to localize the major nodal stations. The system calculates and displays the nodal stations in 3D. Visualization tools within the system enable the user to interact with the stations to locate visible lymph nodes. Additionally, a method and apparatus for producing and previewing a report for peripheral bronchoscopic procedures using patient-specific MDCT chest scans is disclosed. The report provides quantitative data about the route and both static and dynamic previews of the procedure. Static previews consist of virtual bronchoscopic endoluminal renderings at bifurcations encountered along the route, renderings of the airway tree and ROI at the suggested biopsy location, and three-dimensional cues as to the location for the biopsy.",PENN STATE RES FOUND;;HIGGINS WILLIAM E;;GIBBS JASON D;;YU KUN-CHANG;;GRAHAM MICHAEL W;;LU KONGKUO,HIGGINS WILLIAM E;;GIBBS JASON D;;YU KUN-CHANG;;GRAHAM MICHAEL W;;LU KONGKUO,,https://lens.org/088-735-488-800-255,Search Report,yes,4,1,9,9,0,G06T7/162;;G06T7/162;;G06T7/12;;G06T7/12;;G06T2207/20044;;G06T2207/20044;;G06T2207/30061;;G06T2207/30061,A61B6/00;;G05F1/00,,1,0,,,See also references of EP 2244633A4,PENDING

Novel methodologies and systems segment and define accurate endoluminal surfaces in airway trees, including small peripheral bronchi. An automatic algorithm is described that searches the entire lung volume for airway branches and poses airway-tree segmentation as a global graph-theoretic optimization problem. A suite of interactive segmentation tools for cleaning and extending critical areas of the automatically segmented result is disclosed. A model path is reconstructed through the airway tree. Additionally, a computer-based system for automatically locating the central chest lymph -node stations in a 3D MDCT image is described. Automated analysis methods extract the airway tree, airway-tree centerlines, aorta, pulmonary artery, lungs, key skeletal structures, and major-airway labels. Geometrical and anatomical cues arising from the extracted structures are used to localize the major nodal stations. The system calculates and displays the nodal stations in 3D. Visualization tools within the system enable the user to interact with the stations to locate visible lymph nodes. Additionally, a method and apparatus for producing and previewing a report for peripheral bronchoscopic procedures using patient-specific MDCT chest scans is disclosed. The report provides quantitative data about the route and both static and dynamic previews of the procedure. Static previews consist of virtual bronchoscopic endoluminal renderings at bifurcations encountered along the route, renderings of the airway tree and ROI at the suggested biopsy location, and three-dimensional cues as to the location for the biopsy.",PENN STATE RES FOUND;;HIGGINS WILLIAM E;;GIBBS JASON D;;YU KUN-CHANG;;GRAHAM MICHAEL W;;LU KONGKUO,HIGGINS WILLIAM E;;GIBBS JASON D;;YU KUN-CHANG;;GRAHAM MICHAEL W;;LU KONGKUO,,https://lens.org/071-581-077-688-653,Patent Application,yes,0,1,9,9,0,G06T7/162;;G06T7/162;;G06T7/12;;G06T7/12;;G06T2207/20044;;G06T2207/20044;;G06T2207/30061;;G06T2207/30061,A61B6/00;;G05F1/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Novel methodologies and systems segment and define accurate endoluminal surfaces in airway trees, including small peripheral bronchi. An automatic algorithm is described that searches the entire lung volume for airway branches and poses airway-tree segmentation as a global graph-theoretic optimization problem. A suite of interactive segmentation tools for cleaning and extending critical areas of the automatically segmented result is disclosed. A model path is reconstructed through the airway tree. Additionally, a computer-based system for automatically locating the central chest lymph -node stations in a 3D MDCT image is described. Automated analysis methods extract the airway tree, airway-tree centerlines, aorta, pulmonary artery, lungs, key skeletal structures, and major-airway labels. Geometrical and anatomical cues arising from the extracted structures are used to localize the major nodal stations. The system calculates and displays the nodal stations in 3D. Visualization tools within the system enable the user to interact with the stations to locate visible lymph nodes. Additionally, a method and apparatus for producing and previewing a report for peripheral bronchoscopic procedures using patient-specific MDCT chest scans is disclosed. The report provides quantitative data about the route and both static and dynamic previews of the procedure. Static previews consist of virtual bronchoscopic endoluminal renderings at bifurcations encountered along the route, renderings of the airway tree and ROI at the suggested biopsy location, and three-dimensional cues as to the location for the biopsy.",PENN STATE RES FOUND;;HIGGINS WILLIAM E;;GIBBS JASON D;;YU KUN-CHANG;;GRAHAM MICHAEL W;;LU KONGKUO,HIGGINS WILLIAM E;;GIBBS JASON D;;YU KUN-CHANG;;GRAHAM MICHAEL W;;LU KONGKUO,,https://lens.org/081-497-091-863-316,Patent Application,yes,0,24,9,9,0,G06T7/162;;G06T7/162;;G06T7/12;;G06T7/12;;G06T2207/20044;;G06T2207/20044;;G06T2207/30061;;G06T2207/30061,A61B6/00,,54,37,039-880-393-192-836;;050-514-315-425-209;;063-487-292-503-497;;081-535-214-654-309;;107-746-071-221-582;;042-915-824-569-232;;064-833-233-165-948;;108-601-391-855-209;;039-129-092-748-342;;006-492-669-470-111;;081-201-450-596-761;;047-152-884-224-227;;036-907-889-799-576;;032-235-958-699-268;;100-791-459-961-307;;090-776-262-182-186;;150-156-057-109-884;;151-660-075-261-395;;026-142-558-668-323;;031-984-707-050-52X;;020-694-419-586-202;;013-764-751-357-070;;046-655-002-273-608;;029-062-339-078-525;;000-331-487-828-148;;010-794-117-468-310;;002-818-104-890-946;;018-623-389-485-784;;155-263-370-392-618;;163-366-369-919-779;;081-605-874-185-414;;060-300-963-547-772;;031-895-775-732-018;;001-213-503-298-167;;177-044-164-775-018;;144-607-646-779-766;;096-000-143-167-995,10.1007/978-1-4613-0469-2_48;;10.1117/1.482682;;10.1117/12.595283;;16353370;;10.1109/tmi.2005.857654;;pmc1851666;;10.1145/37402.37422;;10.1109/cvpr.2005.538;;16402624;;10.1109/tpami.2006.19;;pmc2646122;;10.1117/12.680710;;18978928;;pmc2131713;;10.1016/j.cviu.2006.10.010;;10.1016/j.compmedimag.2008.08.001;;10.1109/42.836370;;10784282;;10.1109/tmi.2005.857653;;16353371;;pmc2077841;;16686040;;10.1007/11566489_105;;10.1117/12.651719;;10.1109/isbi.2006.1624864;;10.3109/10929080500190342;;16112977;;10.1080/10929080500190342;;10.1117/12.708513;;10.1148/rg.255055044;;16160120;;10671603;;10.1148/radiology.214.2.r00fe34517;;8756944;;10.1148/radiology.200.3.8756944;;10.1109/icpr.1996.547003;;12385510;;10.1016/s1076-6332(03)80517-2;;10.1109/tmi.2004.826945;;15554124;;10.1117/12.467061;;15147620;;10.1016/j.acra.2004.01.012;;15539745;;10.1378/chest.126.5.1687;;10.1378/chest.130.2.559;;16899859;;17229486;;10.1016/j.lungcan.2006.12.005;;10.1006/gmip.1998.0475;;10.1006/gmip.1998.0480;;10.1007/s11548-007-0129-x;;10.1117/12.709532;;10.1287/moor.8.1.1;;10.1007/bf01758841;;10.1109/icip.2001.958638;;10.1017/cbo9780511804441;;10.1117/12.768706,"PISUPATI, L.

A data-set based on 3D image data is pre-computed including reference information representative of a predefined route through a body organ to a final destination. A plurality of live real endoscopic (RE) images are displayed as an operator maneuvers an endoscope within the body organ. A registration and tracking algorithm registers the data-set to one or more of the RE images and continuously maintains the registration as the endoscope is locally maneuvered. Additional information related to the final destination is then presented enabling the endoscope operator to decide on a final maneuver for the procedure. The reference information may include 3D organ surfaces, 3D routes through an organ system, or 3D regions of interest (ROIs), as well as a virtual endoscopic (VE) image generated from the precomputed data-set. The preferred method includes the step of superimposing one or both of the 3D routes and ROIs on one or both of the RE and VE images.

The impact of the design parameters are incorporated into parameters that measure predicted shift in mean on-current and mean off-current and parameters that measure predicted increase in deviations in the distribution of on-current and the off-current. Statistics may be taken at a cell level, a block level, or a chip level to optimize a chip design in a design phase, or to predict changes in parametric yield during manufacturing or after a depressed parametric yield is observed. Further, parametric yield and current level may be predicted region by region and compared with observed thermal emission to pinpoint any anomaly region in a chip to facilitate detection and correction in any mistakes in chip design.",CULP JAMES A;;CHANG PAUL;;CHIDAMBARRAO DURESETI;;ELAKKUMANAN PRAVEEN;;HIBBELER JASON;;MOCUTA ANDA C;;IBM,CULP JAMES A;;CHANG PAUL;;CHIDAMBARRAO DURESETI;;ELAKKUMANAN PRAVEEN;;HIBBELER JASON;;MOCUTA ANDA C,MENTOR GRAPHICS CORPORATION (2012-12-31);;SIEMENS INDUSTRY SOFTWARE INC (2020-12-30),https://lens.org/193-462-233-480-056,Patent Application,yes,0,3,8,8,0,G06F30/30;;G06F30/30;;G01R31/26,G06F17/50,716/56,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

   An infrared radiation ear thermometer has an optical system, an infrared detector, an ambient temperature sensor, and display unit, a signal processing section. Wherein, the infrared detector further includes an infrared sensor and a temperature reference sensor; the infrared sensor is deposition on the substrate and the temperature reference sensor is mount near the substrate of the infrared detector to convert the infrared signal into an electrical signal and sense the reference temperature separately. The ambient temperature sensor is set in the space near the optical system to detect the fast change of the ambient temperature. The signal processing section receives the signals from these temperature sensors to produce an offset by a mathematical algorithm. The offset is used to correct the temperature reading and maintain a high precision even though the ear thermometer suffers from an extreme temperature change.
