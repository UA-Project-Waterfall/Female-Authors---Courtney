In cyber forensics, digital photographs were frequently utilised to capture criminal images, fingerprints, and images of crime scenes, among other things. Because today's cyber forensic systems aren't well-equipped to handle large amounts of image data, obtaining image evidence to convict a criminal is a major challenge; most evidence is provided in the form of raw semantics. With the help of semantics, cyber forensic investigators are often faced with the task of manually evaluating a massive amount of digital image data in order to uncover direct evidence. As a result, the semantic based image retrieval system (SBIR) is the most recent and best alternative for addressing this flaw. The major goal of this study is to create a new framework for semantic-based image retrieval for cyber forensic tools. For cyber-related forensic tools, we present a deep learning framework based on the Convolution neural network (GoogleNet) for recognising distinct facial expressions from the Yale facial image database. The framework is very effective for classification and detection based on semantics or verbal descriptions. After training, the network achieved a reasonable accuracy of 86.25 percent.

Measurements over the operating range of the DAQ system are taken, and characteristic calibration coefficients are determined from the measurements. Software correction based upon the calibration coefficients are made to DAQ system measurement. A digital-to-analog converter (DAC) placed on board the DAQ system having a lower resolution than the DAQ system is calibrated by generating a look-up table of input digital codewords and output electrical signals measured by the calibrated DAQ system. The look-up table is used to field-calibrate the DAQ system using the DAC only, rather than the high resolution reference source. <P>COPYRIGHT: (C)2011,JPO&INPIT",FLUKE CORP,VENNELAKANTI VSS KUMAR;;SRINIVASA RAMESH BABU,,https://lens.org/031-283-279-171-787,Patent Application,no,11,1,8,8,0,G01R35/005;;G01R35/005;;G01D18/00;;G01D18/00;;G01D18/008;;G01R15/00;;G01R15/12,H03M1/10;;G01R19/25;;G01R19/32,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The speed parameters include maximum speed, minimum speed, and average speed of the drive shaft. By correlating a variable spectrum of a motor drive with the speed parameters, machine faults can be identified on the basis of energy distribution in the spectrum. Further, vibration waveforms from two or more locations on the machine can be sequentially acquired through synchronous triggering by using a pulse edge of a stable tachometer signal.

The system accepts user's queries in the form of speech at the client where minimal processing extracts a sufficient number of acoustic speech vectors representing the utterance. These vectors are sent via a communications channel to the server where additional acoustic vectors are derived. Using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and appropriate grammars and dictionaries conditioned by the selections made by the user, the speech representing the user's query is fully decoded into text (or some other suitable form) at the server. This text corresponding to the user's query is then simultaneously sent to a natural language engine and a database processor where optimized SQL statements are constructed for a full-text search from a database for a recordset of several stored questions that best matches the user's query. Further processing in the natural language engine narrows the search to a single stored question. The answer corresponding to this single stored question is next retrieved from the file path and sent to the client in compressed form. At the client, the answer to the user's query is articulated to the user using a text-to-speech engine in his or her native natural language.

    An intelligent query system for processing voiced-based queries is disclosed. This distributed client-server system, typically implemented on an intranet or over the Internet accepts a user's queries at his/her computer, PDA or workstation using a speech input interface. After converting the user's query from speech to text, a 2-step algorithm employing a natural language engine, a database processor and a full-text SQL database is implemented to find a single answer that best matches the user's query. The system, as implemented, accepts environmental variables selected by the user and is scalable to provide answers to a variety and quantity of user-initiated queries.

The system accepts user's queries in the form of speech at the client where minimal processing extracts a sufficient number of acoustic speech vectors representing the utterance. These vectors are sent via a communications channel to the server where additional acoustic vectors are derived. Using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and appropriate grammars and dictionaries conditioned by the selections made by the user, the speech representing the user's query is fully decoded into text (or some other suitable form) at the server. This text corresponding to the user's query is then simultaneously sent to a natural language engine and a database processor where optimized SQL statements are constructed for a full-text search from a database for a recordset of several stored questions that best matches the user's query. Further processing in the natural language engine narrows the search to a single stored question.

    A real-time system incorporating speech recognition and linguistic processing for recognizing a spoken query by a user and distributed between client and server, is disclosed. The system accepts user's queries in the form of speech at the client where minimal processing extracts a sufficient number of acoustic speech vectors representing the utterance. These vectors are sent via a communications channel to the server where additional acoustic vectors are derived. Using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and appropriate grammars and dictionaries conditioned by the selections made by the user, the speech representing the user's query is fully decoded into text (or some other suitable form) at the server. This text corresponding to the user's query is then simultaneously sent to a natural language engine and a database processor where optimized SQL statements are constructed for a full-text search from a database for a recordset of several stored questions that best matches the user's query. Further processing in the natural language engine narrows the search to a single stored question. The answer corresponding to this single stored question is next retrieved from the file path and sent to the client in compressed form. At the client, the answer to the user's query is articulated to the user using a text-to-speech engine in his or her native natural language. The system requires no training and can operate in several natural languages.

    A real-time speech-based learning/training system distributed between client and server, and incorporating speech recognition and linguistic processing for recognizing a spoken question and to provide an answer to the student in a learning or training environment implemented on an intranet or over the Internet, is disclosed. The system accepts the student's question in the form of speech at his or her computer, PDA or workstation where minimal processing extracts a sufficient number of acoustic speech vectors representing the utterance. The system as implemented accepts environmental variables such as course, chapter, section as selected by the user so that the search time, accuracy and response time for the question can be optimized. A minimum set of acoustic vectors extracted at the client are then sent via a communications channel to the server where additional acoustic vectors are derived. Using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and appropriate grammars and dictionaries conditioned by the course, chapter and section selections made by the student, the speech representing the user's query is fully decoding to text at the server. This text corresponding to the user's query is then simultaneously sent to a natural language engine and a database processor where an optimized SQL statement is constructed for a full-text search from a SQL database for a recordset of several stored questions that best matches the user's query. Further processing in the natural language engine narrows the search down to a single stored question. The answer that is paired to this single stored question is then retrieved from the file path and sent to the student computer in compressed form. At the student's computer, the answer is articulated using a text-to-speech engine in his or her native natural language. The system requires no training and can operate in several natural languages.

The system accepts user's queries in the form of speech at the client where minimal processing extracts a sufficient number of acoustic speech vectors representing the utterance. These vectors are sent via a communications channel to the server where additional acoustic vectors are derived. Using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and appropriate grammars and dictionaries conditioned by the selections made by the user, the speech representing the user's query is fully decoded into text (or some other suitable form) at the server. This text corresponding to the user's query is then simultaneously sent to a natural language engine and a database processor where optimized SQL statements are constructed for a full-text search from a database for a recordset of several stored questions that best matches the user's query. Further processing in the natural language engine narrows the search to a single stored question. The answer corresponding to this single stored question is next retrieved from the file path and sent to the client in compressed form. At the client, the answer to the user's query is articulated to the user using a text-to-speech engine in his or her native natural language. The system requires no training and can operate in several natural languages.</PTEXT>",PHOENIX SOLUTIONS INC,BENNETT IAN M;;BABU BANDI RAMESH;;MORKHANDIKAR KISHOR;;GURURAJ PALLAKI,,https://lens.org/153-976-677-091-892,Search Report,no,0,0,9,53,0,G10L15/142;;G10L15/1815;;G10L15/183;;G10L15/285;;G10L15/30;;H04M2250/74;;G06F16/24522;;G10L15/30;;G10L15/285;;G10L15/142;;G10L15/1815;;G10L15/183;;H04M2250/74;;G06F16/24522,G06F3/16;;G06F17/28;;G06F17/30;;G09B7/02;;G10L13/00;;G10L15/00;;G10L15/02;;G10L15/14;;G10L15/18;;G10L15/20;;G10L15/22;;G10L15/28;;G10L21/02,,3,3,079-811-236-541-889;;167-998-520-968-583;;108-814-431-089-844,10.1109/49.743698;;10.1109/vetec.1999.778396;;10.1109/icc.1992.268002,"DIGALAKIS V V ET AL: ""QUANTIZATION OF CEPSTRAL PARAMETERS FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION OVER THEWORLD WIDE WEB"", IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS, IEEE INC.

The system accepts user's queries in the form of speech at the client where minimal processing extracts a sufficient number of acoustic speech vectors representing the utterance. These vectors are sent via a communications channel to the server where additional acoustic vectors are derived. Using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and appropriate grammars and dictionaries conditioned by the selections made by the user, the speech representing the user's query is fully decoded into text (or some other suitable form) at the server. This text corresponding to the user's query is then simultaneously sent to a natural language engine and a database processor where optimized SQL statements are constructed for a full-text search from a database for a recordset of several stored questions that best matches the user's query. Further processing in the natural language engine narrows the search to a single stored question. The answer corresponding to this single stored question is next retrieved from the file path and sent to the client in compressed form. At the client, the answer to the user's query is articulated to the user using a text-to-speech engine in his or her native natural language. The system requires no training and can operate in several natural languages.</PTEXT>",PHOENIX SOLUTIONS INC,BENNETT IAN M;;BABU BANDI RAMESH;;MORKHANDIKAR KISHOR;;GURURAJ PALLAKI,,https://lens.org/143-267-533-374-434,Granted Patent,no,0,1,9,53,0,G10L15/142;;G10L15/1815;;G10L15/183;;G10L15/285;;G10L15/30;;H04M2250/74;;G06F16/24522;;G10L15/30;;G10L15/285;;G10L15/142;;G10L15/1815;;G10L15/183;;H04M2250/74;;G06F16/24522,G06F3/16;;G10L15/22;;G06F17/28;;G06F17/30;;G09B7/02;;G10L13/00;;G10L15/00;;G10L15/02;;G10L15/14;;G10L15/18;;G10L15/20;;G10L15/28;;G10L21/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The method comprises upstream steps of neutralising the whey by-product with a basic metal hydroxide to form a precipitate comprising calcium and phosphate, and separating the precipitate from the whey by-product to provide a clarified whey by-product. The clarified whey by-product is fermentated by a bacterium capable of bioconversion of lactose to lactic acid to provide a fermentation broth containing a lactic acid salt. In the downstream steps, the fermentation broth is acidified to release lactic acid from the lactic acid salt, precipitate from the broth produced by acidification is removed, and the acidified fermentation broth is treated to recover pure lactic acid by removal of residual salts, and water, and optionally protein. The process of the invention produces lactic acid having a purity of 80-98% and an isomeric purity of >98% L-lactic acid using a process that employs upstream removal of divalent salts by chemical precipitation, bacterial fermentation of the demineralised substrate, and minimum downstream processing of the fermentation broth.

With the aid of a multi-input changed LUO converter and a single step three-stage inverter, the sources linked to the grid in this grid connected inverter topology. As a result, in contrast to traditional systems, the proposed topology is modelled using reference frames that contain direct and quadrature axis components. As opposed to other DC-DC converter topologies, the updated LUO converter inherits the advantages. Under a variety of experimental scenarios, the fuzzy logic-based MPPT algorithm performs admirably. The PWM generators also trigger the inverter and LUO converter. The controllers' steady-state and transient responses address, and they are used to ensure that the hybrid energy device runs smoothly. The on-grid current synchronization is accomplished with a PI controller's aid, which reduces THD and complies with the IEEE harmonics norms.
