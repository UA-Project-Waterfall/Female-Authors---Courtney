The plotter utilizes either a flexible or rigid board employing electromagnetic or capacitive resistance technology. It makes use of a fixed X/Y coordinate system to generate latitude and longitude coordinates from a chart overlay. The plotter employs a pencil or pen type stylus with interchangeable cartridge to locate position, derived from electronic position information on the board and hence on the chart. By comparing the location of the stylus to the input data, the plotter directs the user to the input location utilizing a visual, bullseye director display. Given ship's position, on a dead reckoning track or expected destination or waypoint, the plotter gives course, speed distance, and transit time. The plotter can also accept inputs from hand bearing compass or ship's heading compass. The plotter can be used to insert preselected positions into an electronic navigator or a preselected course into an autopilot.",CARVER CHRISTOPHER S;;CARVER CHRISTOPHER,CARVER CHRISTOPHER S;;CARVER CHRISTOPHER,,https://lens.org/182-010-905-358-154,Granted Patent,yes,11,88,1,1,0,G01C21/22;;G01C21/22,G01C21/22,364/443;;364/449;;342/452;;X 73178R,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Using this mechanism, a four-terminal pFET floating-gate silicon MOS transistor for analog learning applications provides nonvolatile memory storage. Electron tunneling permits bidirectional memory updates. Because these updates depend on both the stored memory value and the transistor terminal voltages, the synapses can implement a learning function. The synapse learning follows a simple power law. Unlike conventional EEPROMs, the synapses allow simultaneous memory reading and writing. Synapse transistor arrays can therefore compute both the array output, and local memory updates, in parallel. Synaptic arrays employing these devices enjoy write and erase isolation between array synapses is better than 0.01% because the tunneling and injection processes are exponential in the transistor terminal voltages. The synapses are small, and typically are operated at subthreshold current levels.",CALIFORNIA INST OF TECHN,DIORIO CHRISTOPHER J;;HASLER PAUL E;;MINCH BRADLEY A;;MEAD CARVER A,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (1997-06-09);;SYNOPSYS INC (2010-09-02),https://lens.org/045-860-527-858-269,Granted Patent,yes,18,80,1,10,0,H01L29/76;;H01L29/76,H01L29/76,257/314;;257/315;;257/316;;257/318;;257/321;;257/322;;257/326;;257/391,25,9,050-429-602-540-65X;;033-681-261-425-546;;078-351-209-936-614;;091-916-022-814-138;;142-249-034-867-757;;071-402-956-776-856;;115-448-457-426-147;;090-983-370-457-898;;043-057-243-364-552,10.1109/iscas.1996.541599;;10.1109/4.75004;;18267851;;10.1109/72.317729;;10.1109/40.285219;;10.1007/978-1-4615-3250-7;;10.1109/iscas.1995.523876;;10.1007/bf00166412;;10.1109/101.261888;;10.1109/tcs.1986.1085885,"Diorio, et al., A High Resolution Non Volatile Analog Memory Cell, 1995, IEEE Intl.

The time-varying transfer function is achieved by adding or removing electrons from the fully insulated floating gate of an N-type MOS floating gate transistor. The transistor has a control gate capacitively coupled to the floating gate; it is from the perspective of this control gate that the transfer function of the transistor is modified. Electrons are removed from the floating gate via Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. Electrons are added to the floating gate via hot-electron injection.,CALIFORNIA INST OF TECHN,DIORIO CHRISTOPHER J;;HASLER PAUL E;;MINCH BRADLEY A;;MEAD CARVER A,SYNOPSYS INC (2010-09-02),https://lens.org/058-892-968-665-735,Granted Patent,yes,19,68,2,10,0,G11C27/005;;H01L29/7885;;G11C27/005;;H01L29/7885,G11C27/00;;H01L29/788,365/185.03;;365/185.18;;365/185.28,25,12,061-710-905-959-70X;;050-429-602-540-65X;;033-681-261-425-546;;078-351-209-936-614;;025-148-129-344-380;;091-916-022-814-138;;142-249-034-867-757;;071-402-956-776-856;;115-448-457-426-147;;099-856-437-682-164;;090-983-370-457-898;;043-057-243-364-552,10.1109/iscas.1995.523872;;10.1109/iscas.1996.541599;;10.1109/4.75004;;18267851;;10.1109/72.317729;;10.21236/ada451466;;10.1109/40.285219;;10.1007/978-1-4615-3250-7;;10.1109/iscas.1995.523876;;10.1007/bf00166412;;10.1049/ip-g-2.1991.0064;;10.1109/101.261888;;10.1109/tcs.1986.1085885,"Diorio, et al, A High Resolution Non Volatile Analog Memory Cell , 1995 IEEE, pp. 2233 2235.;;Gray, et al., Analysis and Design of Integrated Circuits , Second Edition, pp. 67 71.;;Hasler, et al., An Autozeroing Amplifier Using PFET Hot Electron Injection , 1996 IEEE.;;Hasler, et al., An Autozeroing Floating Gate Amplifier , IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, Draft Copy, pp. 1 15.;;Hasler, et al., Single Transistor Learning Synapses , pp. 818 824.;;Hasler, et al., Single Transistor Learning Synapase with Long Term Storage , 1995 IEEE, pp. 1660 1663.;;Hochet, et al., Implementation of a Learning Kohonen Neuron Based on a New Multilevel Storage Technique , IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, vol. 26, No. 3, Mar. 1991, pp. 262 267.;;Hollis, et al., A Neural Network Learning Algorithm Tailored for VLSI Implementation , IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, vol. 5, No. 5, Sep. 1994, pp. 784 791.;;Hu, et al., Hot Electron Induced MOSFET Degradation Model, Monitor, and Improvement , IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, vol.

The method processes a first solution that contains standard detectable taxanes and other undetectable taxane compounds to generate a second solution that contains a higher percentage of detectable standard taxane then the first solution. The first step of this method is loading a column having a first opening and a second opening with an ion exchange media. The next step is placing the first solution in the first opening of the column so that the first solution passes through the ion exchange media in the column and flows to the second opening. Thus, the taxane compounds are converted to standard taxanes by an ion exchange reaction and the second solution is formed. Then the next step is collecting, from the second opening of the column, the second solution and recovering from the second solution a larger percentage of standard taxanes then was detectable in the first solution.

The capacitance is voltage dependent and is strongly nonlinear in the depletion region. The accumulation and strong inversion regions are also nonlinear, but to a much smaller degree. The nonlinearity can be significantly reduced by connecting two of the capacitors in series. This series connection also makes possible a capacitor structure with an isolated floating gate connecting the two series capacitors. The charge on the floating gate can be controlled by tunneling and injection to vary the capacitor bias voltage and thus, its capacitance. Alternatively, the capacitors may operate in the accumulation region. In this configuration the accumulation capacitors do not require transistors nor do they require source and drain regions.

The method processes a first solution that contains standard detectable taxanes and other undetectable taxane compounds to generate a second solution that contains a higher percentage of detectable standard taxane then the first solution. The first step of this method is loading a column having a first opening and a second opening with an ion exchange media. The next step is placing the first solution in the first opening of the column so that the first solution passes through the ion exchange media in the column and flows to the second opening. Thus, the taxane compounds are converted to standard taxanes by an ion exchange reaction and the second solution is formed. Then the next step is collecting, from the second opening of the column, the second solution and recovering from the second solution a larger percentage of standard taxanes then was detectable in the first solution.

The method processes a first solution that contains standard detectable taxanes and other undetectable taxane compounds to generate a second solution that contains a higher percentage of detectable standard taxane then the first solution. The first step of this method is loading a column having a first opening and a second opening with an ion exchange media. The next step is placing the first solution in the first opening of the column so that the first solution passes through the ion exchange media in the column and flows to the second opening. Thus, the taxane compounds are converted to standard taxanes by an ion exchange reaction and the second solution is formed. Then the next step is collecting, from the second opening of the column, the second solution and recovering from the second solution a larger percentage of standard taxanes then was detectable in the first solution. The ion exchange media of the present solution is an ion exchange resin. The ion exchange resin can be a mixture of an anion exchange resin and a cation exchange resin.

It can achieve a highpass characteristic at frequencies well below 1 Hz. In contrast with conventional autozeroing amplifiers that eliminate their input offset, the AFGA nulls its output offset. The AFGA is a continuous-time filter; it does not require any clocking. The AFGA includes at least one floating-gate MOS transistor that is capable of hot-electron injection of electrons onto the floating gate of the MOS transistor. Electrons are continuously removed from the floating gate(s), for example, via Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. The AFGA has a stable equilibrium for which this tunneling current is balanced by an injection current of equal magnitude. When the circuit is driven away from its equilibrium by an input or something else, an imbalance between the tunneling and injection current charges (if the tunneling current exceeds the injection current) or discharges (if the injection current exceeds the tunneling current) the floating gate(s) until the equilibrium is re-established. The equilibrium is chosen to achieve a desired baseline of operation.",CALIFORNIA INST OF TECHN,MINCH BRADLEY A;;HASLER PAUL E;;DIORIO CHRISTOPHER J;;MEAD CARVER A,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (1996-10-28);;SYNOPSYS INC (2010-09-02),https://lens.org/025-907-100-668-829,Granted Patent,yes,15,99,2,10,0,G11C27/005;;H03F1/301;;H03F3/082;;H10B69/00;;G11C27/005;;H03F3/082;;H03F1/301;;H10B69/00,G11C27/00;;H01L27/115;;H03F1/30;;H03F3/08,365/185.01;;365/185.21;;365/185.28;;327/337,18,10,061-710-905-959-70X;;050-429-602-540-65X;;055-049-136-174-521;;038-165-285-717-122;;091-916-022-814-138;;142-249-034-867-757;;071-402-956-776-856;;115-448-457-426-147;;090-983-370-457-898;;043-057-243-364-552,10.1109/iscas.1995.523872;;10.1109/iscas.1996.541599;;10.1109/iscas.1995.523729;;10.1109/t-ed.1985.21952;;10.1109/40.285219;;10.1007/978-1-4615-3250-7;;10.1109/iscas.1995.523876;;10.1007/bf00166412;;10.1109/101.261888;;10.1109/tcs.1986.1085885,"A.G.

The method processes a first solution that contains standard detectable taxanes and other undetectable taxane compounds to generate a second solution that contains a higher percentage of detectable standard taxane then the first solution. The first step of this method is loading a column having a first opening and a second opening with an ion exchange media. The next step is placing the first solution in the first opening of the column so that the first solution passes through the ion exchange media in the column and flows to the second opening. Thus, the taxane compounds are converted to standard taxanes by an ion exchange reaction and the second solution is formed. Then the next step is collecting, from the second opening of the column, the second solution and recovering from the second solution a larger percentage of standard taxanes then was detectable in the first solution. The ion exchange media of the present solution is an ion exchange resin. The ion exchange resin can be a mixture of an anion exchange resin and a cation exchange resin. The anion exchange resin is in the OH-form. The cation exchange resin is in the H+ form. Preferably, the ion exchange resin is alumina.",NAPRO BIOTHERAPEUTICS INC,CARVER DAVID R;;PROUT TIMOTHY R;;WORKMAN CHRISTOPHER T;;HENDERSON DONIA L,"NAPRO BIOTHERAPEUTICS, INC.

It can achieve a highpass characteristic at frequencies well below 1 Hz. In contrast with conventional autozeroing amplifiers that eliminate their input offset, the AFGA nulls its output offset. The AFGA is a continuous-time filter; it does not require any clocking. The AFGA includes at least one floating-gate MOS transistor that is capable of hot-electron injection of electrons onto the floating gate of the MOS transistor. Electrons are continuously removed from the floating gate(s), for example, via Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. The AFGA has a stable equilibrium for which this tunneling current is balanced by an injection current of equal magnitude. When the circuit is driven away from its equilibrium by an input or something else, an imbalance between the tunneling and injection current charges (if the tunneling current exceeds the injection current) or discharges (if the injection current exceeds the tunneling current) the floating gate(s) until the equilibrium is re-established. The equilibrium is chosen to achieve a desired baseline of operation.",CALIFORNIA INST OF TECHN,MINCH BRADLEY A;;HASLER PAUL E;;DIORIO CHRISTOPHER J;;MEAD CARVER A,SYNOPSYS INC (2010-09-02),https://lens.org/132-106-521-030-03X,Granted Patent,yes,22,69,2,10,0,G11C27/005;;H03F1/301;;H03F3/082;;H10B69/00;;G11C27/005;;H03F3/082;;H03F1/301;;H10B69/00,G11C27/00;;H01L27/115;;H03F1/30;;H03F3/08,365/185.01;;365/185.21;;365/185.28;;327/335,21,9,050-429-602-540-65X;;033-681-261-425-546;;078-351-209-936-614;;091-916-022-814-138;;142-249-034-867-757;;071-402-956-776-856;;115-448-457-426-147;;090-983-370-457-898;;043-057-243-364-552,10.1109/iscas.1996.541599;;10.1109/4.75004;;18267851;;10.1109/72.317729;;10.1109/40.285219;;10.1007/978-1-4615-3250-7;;10.1109/iscas.1995.523876;;10.1007/bf00166412;;10.1109/101.261888;;10.1109/tcs.1986.1085885,"Diorio, et al., A High Resolution Non Volatile Analog Memory Cell, 1995, IEEE Intl.

The method processes a first solution that contains standard detectable taxanes and other undetectable taxane compounds to generate a second solution that contains a higher percentage of detectable standard taxane then the first solution. The first step of this method is loading a column having a first opening and a second opening with an ion exchange media. The next step is placing the first solution in the first opening of the column so that the first solution passes through the ion exchange media in the column and flows to the second opening. Thus, the taxane compounds are converted to standard taxanes by an ion exchange reaction and the second solution is formed. Then the next step is collecting, from the second opening of the column, the second solution and recovering from the second solution a larger percentage of standard taxanes then was detectable in the first solution. The ion exchange media of the present solution is an ion exchange resin. The ion exchange resin can be a mixture of an anion exchange resin and a cation exchange resin. The anion exchange resin is in the OH-form. The cation exchange resin is in the H+ form. Preferably, the ion exchange resin is alumina.",NAPRO BIOTHERAPEUTICS INC,WORKMAN CHRISTOPHER T;;HANDERSON DONIA L;;CARVER DAVID R;;PROUT TIMOTHY R;;HENDERSON DONIA L;;HUGHES CHARLES L,,https://lens.org/138-429-341-234-507,Patent Application,no,0,1,21,21,0,C07D305/14;;C07D305/14,C07D305/14,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The tool (802) can use all or some of these detectors. The alignment detector (804) provides an orthogonal laser line grid (806) on an incident surface when the detector has a predefined relationship with the surface. The depth detector (812) emits two sets of parallel laser planes that converge with each other. When the laser planes impact on an incident surface two sets of lines (801, 803, 805, 807) are formed. The laser lines (801, 803) from one laser plane set move closer to the lines (805, 807) from the other laser plane set as the depth detector (812) moves closer to the surface - showing changes in depth or distance. The level detector employs two converging laser planes. An operator positions the level detector above an incident surface, so the laser planes' line of intersection appears on the surface if the surface is level. If the surface is not level, lines separate from each laser plane appear on the surface - signaling the need for a level adjustment. Some versions of the tool have the ability to detect their own orientation and make adjustments based on the orientation.

   A tool operates with a guide system to identify the orientation of a tool on a work piece. In one implementation, the tool identifies its orientation with respect to a guide signal supplied by the guide system. In an alternate embodiment, the tool determines its absolute orientation, such as a (x, y) coordinate. The tool includes an action component adapted to alter the work piece, such as a cutting head in a router. A guide detector in the tool detects a position of a guide signal from the guide system. A location detector in the tool receives the position data and employs it to determine the tool's orientation. Based on the detected orientation, the tool decides whether any tool adjustments are necessary. Examples of tool adjustments include the following: adjusting the position of the action component, enabling or disabling the action component, and providing operating indicators to direct a tool operator's use of the tool.
