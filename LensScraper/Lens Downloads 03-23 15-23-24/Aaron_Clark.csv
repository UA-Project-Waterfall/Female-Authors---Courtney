The slide includes a slot in which the tube is placed. A calibrated scale is disposed adjacent to the slot for use in measuring various blood sample parameters, such as hematocrit, platelet count, and the like. Anemia and/or low platelet counts are indicative of potentially serious complications of malaria. Their detection will prompt a physician to consider the liklihood of serious illness due to malaria. The presence or absence of blood-borne parasites can also be determined using the procedures of this invention. Thus the device allows a blood sample to be analyzed for malaria parasites, and also allows measurement of hematicrit and platelet counts. The scale can be presented in a normal image when a simple lens magnification, such as a magnifying glass, is used to view the tube and slide; and can also be presented in mirror image when compound lens magnification, such as a microscope, is used to view the tube and slide. <IMAGE>",LEVINE ROBERT A;;WARDLAW STEPHEN C,LEVINE ROBERT AARON;;WARDLAW STEPHEN CLARK,,https://lens.org/052-225-719-707-351,Granted Patent,yes,4,0,12,12,0,B01L3/5021;;G01N33/491;;G01N2015/055;;G02B21/34;;Y10S435/81;;Y10S435/97;;Y10S436/81;;Y10S436/805;;Y02A50/30;;B01L3/5021;;G02B21/34;;G01N33/491;;G01N2015/055;;Y10S435/97;;Y10S436/805;;Y10S436/81;;Y10S435/81,B01L3/14;;G01N15/05;;G01N33/49;;G02B21/34,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

When possibly contaminated materials, such as blood, are being tested, the use of an evacuated tube allows the measurements to be made without the technician being exposed to the blood. The tubes are large enough to hold approximately one ml of blood, and are filled with an inert gas at low pressure. The floats are formed with a through bore (7) into which cell bands to be harvested will settle during centrifugation. The cell bands (A-E) are stabilized by a layer of a flowable material which settles onto the plasma layer during centrifugation and forms a pellicle thereon. The cell layers to be harvested are aspirated from the float bore by means of a hypodermic needle (131) or cannula inserted into the tube and float bore. <IMAGE>",LEVINE ROBERT A;;WARDLAW STEPHEN C,LEVINE ROBERT AARON;;WARDLAW STEPHEN CLARK,,https://lens.org/057-254-117-786-165,Patent Application,no,0,4,19,19,0,B01L3/50215;;G01N33/491;;Y10T436/25375;;Y10T436/2575;;Y10T436/25375;;Y10T436/2575;;G01N33/491;;B01L3/50215,G01N1/10;;A61B5/15;;B01L3/14;;G01N1/14;;G01N1/36;;G01N33/15;;G01N33/48;;G01N33/49,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The float is axially elongated and has a specific gravity which causes it to float in the packed red blood cells when the sample is centrifuged in the tube. The hemoglobin concentration of the packed red blood cells is measured by measuring the depth that the float sinks into the red cell layer, and then the hemoglobin concentration of the blood is calculated. The hemoglobin can be measured in this manner because virtually the only red cell component which contributes density to the red cells is the hemoglobin. The hemoglobin concentration of the whole blood is calculated by multiplying the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration of the packed red blood cells by the packed cell volume % (hematocrit) of the whole blood.

The extraction well system provides for a well casing that extends downwardly proximate to an existing mine cavity and an extension casing that extends downwardly below the mine roof. In one embodiment the extension casing is external to the well casing and is attached to the well casing mechanically such as with a dual thread reducer. The extension runs from above the mine roof to below the mine floor and is perforated in the area of the mine cavity to allow liquid to drain into the bottom of the extension well. In a second embodiment, the extension casing is interior to the well casing and is attached for example by an internal liner hanger.

The slide includes a slot in which the tube is placed. A calibrated scale is disposed adjacent to the slot for use in measuring various blood sample parameters, such as hematocrit, platelet count, and the like. Anemia and/or low platelet counts are indicative of potentially serious complications of malaria. Their detection will prompt a physician to consider the liklihood of serious illness due to malaria. The presence or absence of blood-borne parasites can also be determined using the procedures of this invention. Thus the device allows a blood sample to be analyzed for malaria parasites, and also allows measurement of hematicrit and platelet counts. The scale can be presented in a normal image when a simple lens magnification, such as a magnifying glass, is used to view the tube and slide; and can also be presented in mirror image when compound lens magnification, such as a microscope, is used to view the tube and slide.",LEVINE ROBERT A;;WARDLAW STEPHEN C,LEVINE ROBERT AARON;;WARDLAW STEPHEN CLARK,,https://lens.org/096-706-326-723-418,Search Report,yes,4,0,12,12,0,B01L3/5021;;G01N33/491;;G01N2015/055;;G02B21/34;;Y10S435/81;;Y10S435/97;;Y10S436/81;;Y10S436/805;;Y02A50/30;;B01L3/5021;;G02B21/34;;G01N33/491;;G01N2015/055;;Y10S435/97;;Y10S436/805;;Y10S436/81;;Y10S435/81,B01L3/14;;G01N15/05;;G01N33/49;;G02B21/34,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The float is axially elongated and has a specific gravity which causes it to float in the packed red blood cells when the sample is centrifuged in the tube. The hemoglobin concentration of the packed red blood cells is measured by measuring the depth that the float sinks into the red cell layer, and then the hemoglobin concentration of the blood is calculated. The hemoglobin can be measured in this manner because virtually the only red cell component which contributes density to the red cells is the hemoglobin.

The hemoglobin concentration of the packed red blood cells is measured by measuring the depth that the float sinks into the red cell layer, and then the hemoglobin concentration of the blood is calculated. The hemoglobin can be measured in this manner because virtually the only red cell component which contributes density to the red cells is the hemoglobin. The hemoglobin concentration of the whole blood is calculated by multiplying the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration of the packed red blood cells by the packed cell volume % (hematocrit) of the whole blood. All of the necessary calculations may be performed by a preprogramed microprocessor.","LEVINE, ROBERT AARON;;WARDLAW, STEPHEN CLARK","LEVINE, ROBERT AARON;;WARDLAW, STEPHEN CLARK","WARDLAW, STEPHEN CLARK (1990-01-10);;LEVINE, ROBERT AARON (1990-01-10)",https://lens.org/104-300-623-739-887,Granted Patent,yes,5,0,27,28,0,B01L3/50215;;G01N9/12;;G01N33/491;;G01N9/12;;B01L3/50215;;G01N33/491,B01L3/14;;G01N9/12;;G01N33/48;;G01N33/49;;G01N33/72,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The float is axially elongated and has a specific gravity which causes it to float in the packed red blood cells when the sample is centrifuged in the tube. The hemoglobin concentration of the packed red blood cells is measured by measuring the depth that the float sinks into the red cell layer, and then the hemoglobin concentration of the blood is calculated. The hemoglobin can be measured in this manner because virtually the only red cell component which contributes density to the red cells is the hemoglobin. The hemoglobin concentration of the whole blood is calculated by multiplying the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration of the packed red blood cells by the packed cell volume % (hematocrit) of the whole blood.

The slide includes a slot in which the tube is placed. A calibrated scale is disposed adjacent to the slot for use in measuring various blood sample parameters, such as hematocrit, platelet count, and the like. Anemia and/or low platelet counts are indicative of potentially serious complications of malaria. Their detection will prompt a physician to consider the liklihood of serious illness due to malaria. The presence or absence of blood-borne parasites can also be determined using the procedures of this invention. Thus the device allows a blood sample to be analyzed for malaria parasites, and also allows measurement of hematicrit and platelet counts. The scale can be presented in a normal image when a simple lens magnification, such as a magnifying glass, is used to view the tube and slide; and can also be presented in mirror image when compound lens magnification, such as a microscope, is used to view the tube and slide. <IMAGE>",LEVINE ROBERT A;;WARDLAW STEPHEN C,LEVINE ROBERT AARON;;WARDLAW STEPHEN CLARK,,https://lens.org/146-068-360-282-431,Granted Patent,no,0,0,12,12,0,B01L3/5021;;G01N33/491;;G01N2015/055;;G02B21/34;;Y10S435/81;;Y10S435/97;;Y10S436/81;;Y10S436/805;;Y02A50/30;;B01L3/5021;;G02B21/34;;G01N33/491;;G01N2015/055;;Y10S435/97;;Y10S436/805;;Y10S436/81;;Y10S435/81,B01L3/14;;G01N15/05;;G01N33/49;;G02B21/34,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

When possibly contaminated materials, such as blood, are being tested the use of the evacuated tube allows the measurements to be made without the technician being exposed to the blood. The tubes are large enough to hold approximately one ml of blood, and are filled with an inert gas at low pressure. Dimensional tolerances relative to those of a capillary tube are relaxed for the tube and float due to the larger sample capacity. The cell bands (32) are stabilized by a layer of a flowable material which settles onto the plasma layer (34) during centrifugation and forms a pellicle thereon.

The target analyte is a unique nucleotide sequence of the RNA or DNA of a suspect organism, or any nucleotide target, or a combination of nucleotide sequences thereof, which organism may be found in the substance. The media contains selected target analyte amplifiers which will result in the amplification of any target analytes which are present in the substance. The media may also contain one or more labeled analyte-specific materials (LASMs) which can migrate through the media. The nature of the media is such that it will support target analyte-copying but will not allow the target analyte to migrate extensively within the media. After the substance to be assayed is added to the media and any target analytes are amplified, the LASMs will migrate by diffusion to resultant target analyte units or colonies in the media, thereby creating intensely labeled localized areas in the media which can be visually or mechanically detected.

When possibly contaminated materials, such as blood, are being tested, the use of an evacuated tube allows the measurements to be made without the technician being exposed to the blood. The tubes are large enough to hold approximately one ml of blood, and arefilled with an inert gas at low pressure. The floats are formed with a through bore into which cell bands to be harvested will settle during centrifugation. The cell bands are stabilized by a layer of a flowable material which settles onto the plasma layer during centrifugation and forms a pellicle thereon. The cell layers to be harvested areaspirated from the float bore by means of a hypodermic needle or cannula inserted into the tube and float bore.",LEVINE ROBERT A;;WARDLAW STEPHEN C,LEVINE ROBERT AARON;;WARDLAW STEPHEN CLARK,,https://lens.org/145-838-259-911-75X,Patent Application,no,0,0,19,19,0,B01L3/50215;;G01N33/491;;Y10T436/25375;;Y10T436/2575;;Y10T436/25375;;Y10T436/2575;;G01N33/491;;B01L3/50215,G01N1/10;;A61B5/15;;B01L3/14;;G01N1/14;;G01N1/36;;G01N33/15;;G01N33/48;;G01N33/49,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The target analyte is a unique nucleotide sequence of the RNA or DNA of a suspect organism, or any nucleotide target, or a combination of nucleotide sequences thereof, which organism may be found in the substance. The media contains selected target analyte amplifiers which will result in the amplification of any target analytes which are present in the substance. The media may also contain one or more labeled analyte-specific materials (LASMs) which can migrate through the media. The nature of the media is such that it will support target analyte-copying but will not allow the target analyte to migrate extensively within the media. After the substance to be assayed is added to the media and any target analytes are amplified, the LASMs will migrate by diffusion to resultant target analyte units or colonies in the media, thereby creating intensely labeled localized areas in the media which can be visually or mechanically detected. Each of the intensely labeled areas in the media will be surrounded by low intensity label halos.

The slide includes a slot in which the tube is placed. A calibrated scale is disposed adjacent to the slot for use in measuring various blood sample parameters, such as hematocrit, platelet count, and the like. Anemia and/or low platelet counts are indicative of potentially serious complications of malaria. Their detection will prompt a physician to consider the liklihood of serious illness due to malaria. The presence or absence of blood-borne parasites can also be determined using the procedures of this invention. Thus the device allows a blood sample to be analyzed for malaria parasites, and also allows measurement of hematicrit and platelet counts. The scale can be presented in a normal image when a simple lens magnification, such as a magnifying glass, is used to view the tube and slide; and can also be presented in mirror image when compound lens magnification, such as a microscope, is used to view the tube and slide. <IMAGE>",LEVINE ROBERT A;;WARDLAW STEPHEN C,LEVINE ROBERT AARON;;WARDLAW STEPHEN CLARK,,https://lens.org/003-408-506-923-872,Granted Patent,no,0,0,12,12,0,B01L3/5021;;G01N33/491;;G01N2015/055;;G02B21/34;;Y10S435/81;;Y10S435/97;;Y10S436/81;;Y10S436/805;;Y02A50/30;;B01L3/5021;;G02B21/34;;G01N33/491;;G01N2015/055;;Y10S435/97;;Y10S436/805;;Y10S436/81;;Y10S435/81,B01L3/14;;G01N15/05;;G01N33/49;;G02B21/34,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

When possibly contaminated materials, such as blood, are being tested, the use of an evacuated tube allows the measurements to be made without the technician being exposed to the blood. The tubes are large enough to hold approximately one ml of blood, and are filled with an inert gas at low pressure. The floats are formed with a through bore (7) into which cell bands to be harvested will settle during centrifugation. The cell bands (A-E) are stabilized by a layer of a flowable material which settles onto the plasma layer during centrifugation and forms a pellicle thereon. The cell layers to be harvested are aspirated from the float bore by means of a hypodermic needle (131) or cannula inserted into the tube and float bore. <IMAGE>",LEVINE ROBERT A;;WARDLAW STEPHEN C,LEVINE ROBERT AARON;;WARDLAW STEPHEN CLARK,,https://lens.org/116-578-302-958-888,Granted Patent,yes,3,17,19,19,0,B01L3/50215;;G01N33/491;;Y10T436/25375;;Y10T436/2575;;Y10T436/25375;;Y10T436/2575;;G01N33/491;;B01L3/50215,G01N1/10;;A61B5/15;;B01L3/14;;G01N1/14;;G01N1/36;;G01N33/15;;G01N33/48;;G01N33/49,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The treated blood sample is then centrifuged in a tube containing a buffy coat expanding insert thereby physically expanding the axial extent of the blood sample s buffy coat components in the tube. By reducing the tendency of the erythrocytes to repel each other, a clearer demarcation between the erythrocytes and the buffy coat can be achieved. The effect of agglutinating reagents which may have been added to the blood sample will also be enhanced. The aforesaid procedure and reagents make it possible for the first time to accurately analyze a centrifuged sample of anticoagulated bovine whole blood and obtain hematocrit and differential white cell counts therefrom. Additionally, human blood samples which otherwise exhibit a streaming tendency can also be accurately analyzed by the addition of a combination of the appropriate erythrocyte repulsion-reducing reagents along with agglutinating reagents.",WARDLAW STEPHEN C;;LEVINE ROBERT A,WARDLAW STEPHEN CLARK;;LEVINE ROBERT AARON,,https://lens.org/123-139-488-284-672,Patent Application,yes,0,7,10,10,0,G01N15/05;;G01N33/50,G01N9/30;;G01N11/00;;G01N15/04;;G01N33/48;;G01N15/05;;G01N33/49;;G01N33/50,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The slide includes a slot in which the tube is placed. A calibrated scale is disposed adjacent to the slot for use in measuring various blood sample parameters, such as hematocrit, platelet count, and the like. Anemia and/or low platelet counts are indicative of potentially serious complications of malaria. Their detection will prompt a physician to consider the liklihood of serious illness due to malaria. The presence or absence of blood-borne parasites can also be determined using the procedures of this invention. Thus the device allows a blood sample to be analyzed for malaria parasites, and also allows measurement of hematicrit and platelet counts. The scale can be presented in a normal image when a simple lens magnification, such as a magnifying glass, is used to view the tube and slide; and can also be presented in mirror image when compound lens magnification, such as a microscope, is used to view the tube and slide. <IMAGE>",LEVINE ROBERT A;;WARDLAW STEPHEN C,LEVINE ROBERT AARON;;WARDLAW STEPHEN CLARK,,https://lens.org/187-939-670-002-907,Granted Patent,no,0,0,12,12,0,B01L3/5021;;G01N33/491;;G01N2015/055;;G02B21/34;;Y10S435/81;;Y10S435/97;;Y10S436/81;;Y10S436/805;;Y02A50/30;;B01L3/5021;;G02B21/34;;G01N33/491;;G01N2015/055;;Y10S435/97;;Y10S436/805;;Y10S436/81;;Y10S435/81,B01L3/14;;G01N15/05;;G01N33/49;;G02B21/34,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

When a substance possible to be contaminated like blood is inspected, if the tube is used, an inspecting engineer can measure it without contacting the blood. The tube 2 has the size capable of accommodating the flood of about 1ml, and is filled with low-pressure inert gas. A through hole is formed at the float 6, and the cell group to be sampled is gathered to the hole during the centrifugal separation. The group is gathered on a plasma layer during the centrifugal separation and held in the stable state by the layer of the fluidized substance for forming a membrane on the plasma layer.

A control signal 510 may specify the particular pooling or aggregation function to use as well as a stride value. Pooling may occur in parallel, with each pooling circuit 508 receiving an element from the set of values over a given clock cycle.

Results of function executions can be stored so that when the function is invoked again with the same arguments, the stored results can be used instead of re-executing the function. However, using a stored function result, instead of re-executing the function, can only be done safely when data sources used in the function execution have not changed since a previous function execution of the current function invocation. The function result tracking system disclosed herein can correlate, with function executions, one or more timeframes for which results of that function execution are valid. For example, each node referenced in a trace can represent a function execution and each node can be associated with a data structure that keeps track of results of function executions, and timeframes for when those results are valid or invalid.",FACEBOOK INC,HOSTETTER MATHEW JAMES;;HOSMER BASIL CLARK;;ORENSTEIN AARON,META PLATFORMS INC (2017-12-08),https://lens.org/174-481-085-080-396,Patent Application,yes,1,2,2,2,0,G06F16/2365;;G06F16/2365,G06F17/30,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Results of function executions can be stored so that when the function is invoked again with the same arguments, the stored results can be used instead of re-executing the function. However, using a stored function result, instead of re-executing the function, can only be done safely when data sources used in the function execution have not changed since a previous function execution of the current function invocation. The function result tracking system disclosed herein can correlate, with function executions, one or more timeframes for which results of that function execution are valid. For example, each node referenced in a trace can represent a function execution and each node can be associated with a data structure that keeps track of results of function executions, and timeframes for when those results are valid or invalid.",FACEBOOK INC,HOSTETTER MATHEW JAMES;;HOSMER BASIL CLARK;;ORENSTEIN AARON,META PLATFORMS INC (2017-12-08),https://lens.org/184-353-598-632-850,Granted Patent,yes,1,0,2,2,0,G06F16/2365;;G06F16/2365,G06F17/00;;G06F16/23,,7,4,131-006-129-422-819;;091-223-812-861-009;;027-959-612-140-240;;005-809-825-914-80X,10.1145/1596527.1596530;;10.1145/1806596.1806650;;10.1145/2594291.2594324;;10.1145/1411204.1411249,"Acar, U., et al., “An Experimental Analysis of Self-Adjusting Computation,” ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, vol. 32, No. 1, Article 3, Oct. 2009, 53 pages.;;Acar, U., et al., “Self-Adjusting Computation,” Carnegie Mellon University, May 2005, 299 pages.;;Acar, U., et al., “Traceable Data Types for Self-Adjusting Computation,” PLDI, Jun. 5-10, 2010, 14 pages.;;Acar, U., et al., “Adaptive Functional Programming,” Carnegie Mellon University, May 2006, 46 pages.;;Burckhardt, S. et al., “Two for the Price of One: A Model for Parallel and Incremental Computation,” OOPSLA, Oct. 22-27, 2011, 18 pages.;;Hammer, M. et al., “ADAPTON: Composable, Demand-Driven Incremental Computation,” PLDI, Jun. 9-11, 2014, 11 pages.;;Ley-Wild, R. et al., “Compiling Self-Adjusting Programs with Continuations,” ICFP, Sep. 22-24, 2008, 13 pages.",ACTIVE

Engagement of the battery package (100) to the radio is accomplished via matching a plurality of retaining rails (110) via notches (112) with a plurality of opposing and complementary retaining rails on the radio (402). A simple sliding motion locks the latch (106) to the radio (402). Disengagement requires little force as the latch (106) is depressed in the same direction as the battery package (100) is slid down. The battery comes to a stop when an alignment of the notches (112) with the radio retaining rails has taken place. An effortless lift separates the battery package (100) from the radio (402).,MOTOROLA INC,KOTTKE WILLE;;CASTANEDA JULIO C;;CLARK AARON P,MOTOROLA MOBILITY LLC (2012-06-22);;GOOGLE TECHNOLOGY HOLDINGS LLC (2014-10-28);;AMPEREX TECHNOLOGY LIMITED (2018-06-04),https://lens.org/199-453-313-431-08X,Granted Patent,yes,5,56,6,6,0,H01M50/213;;H04B1/08;;H04M1/0262;;H01M50/213;;H04M1/0262;;Y02E60/10,H01M2/10;;H04B1/08;;H04B1/38;;H04M1/02;;H04W88/02;;H05K5/02,429/100;;429/96,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

At least one of the convergent walls (8) of the chamber is transparent so that the blood sample can be observed. The chamber's varying thickness produces a first lesser thickness region (A) in the chamber wherein individual red cells (32) and quiescent monolayers (31) of red cells in the sample will reside after the sample is introduced into and fills the chamber. Larger formed constituents such as white blood cells (34) and nucleated red blood cells present in the sample will reside in greater thickness regions (B) of the chamber, and non-nucleated red cells which reside in such greater thickness regions will agglomerate to form rouleaux (33). By admixing fluorescent dyes with the blood sample, target cells in the sample can be enumerated and differentiated by means of a scanning instrument (54) which is able to measure different wave length color signals emitted from the target cells in the sample, and differentiate the target cells one from another by reason of the nature of the emitted color signals.

At least one of the convergent walls (8) of the chamber is transparent so that the blood sample can be observed. The chamber's varying thickness produces a first lesser thickness region (A) in the chamber wherein individual red cells (32) and quiescent monolayers (31) of red cells in the sample will reside after the sample is introduced into and fills the chamber.

A sample of blood is drawn into a capillary tube which contains a generally cylindrical mass having a specific gravity such that it will float in one of the cell layers when the sample is separated by centrifugation. The specific gravity of the mass is selected so as to cause the cylindrical mass to combine with the bore wall of the capillary tube to form a thin annular space in the capillary tube into which the parasites will be crowded, thus increasing the concentration of parasites in a restricted area of the centrifuged blood sample and rendering the parasites highly visible. A stain may be used to differentially color the parasites.

A centrifuge tube is used to hold the blood sample and an appropriately shaped body is disposed in the tube in the zone occupied by the white cell and platelet layers whose volume is to be measured. The body reduces the available volume within the tube which may be occupied by the white cell and platelet layers and thus expands the axial extent thereof to make visual measurement of the white cell and platelet layers more accurate. The body has an inwardly and upwardly tapered upper end portion which prevents platelet cells from aggregating on the top of the body.,WARDLAW STEPHEN C;;LEVINE ROBERT A;;MASSEY JAMES V III,WARDLAW STEPHEN CLARK;;LEVINE ROBERT AARON;;MASSEY III JAMES VINCENT,,https://lens.org/113-991-306-989-104,Granted Patent,yes,9,166,32,32,0,A61B5/145;;A61B5/150022;;A61B5/150343;;A61B5/15142;;B01L3/50215;;B04B5/0421;;G01N33/48;;G01N33/491;;A61B5/150022;;B01L3/50215;;A61B5/145;;A61B5/150343;;A61B5/15142;;G01N33/48;;G01N33/491;;B04B5/0421,G01N33/48;;A61B5/145;;B01L3/14;;G01N33/49,128  2F,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Boreholes. SHELL OIL CO., CONTINENTAL OIL CO., SUPERIOR OIL CO., and UNION OIL CO. OF CALIFORNIA. Aug. 14, 1957, No. 25608/57. Class 85. [Also in Groups XXVI and XXXIV] Subaqueous apparatus for drilling or working in a borehole 24 comprises a floating vessel 20, a well-head base anchored over the borehole in a formation 23, laterally flexible guides 61 between the base and vessel, means for lowering the drilling or working tool from the vessel, and means for slidably connecting the tool and the guides so that as the tool is lowered it is constrained to register with the upper end of the borehole, Mounted on the vessel are a mud tank 51, a draw-works 25, a collapsible drilling rig 27, and a rotary table 36 mounted on gimbals over a collar 39. A length of casing 45 fixed in the borehole is secured to a pair of arms 58 resting on the formation. A circulating head 43 is releasably sealed to a receiver 44 which is releasably sealed to the casing. A guide post 60 extends from each arm 58, a guide line 61 extending from the bottom of each post out through the top, and a sleeve 63 connected to the head engaging each post. During the installation of the head it is first supported within the collar with the guide lines threaded through the sleeves and running over pulleys 69, 66. A drill collar 46 is lowered through the head, the bit 47 is secured to the collar, and the head is released, the bit engaging an internal shoulder within the head to support it. The head is lowered on to the receiver by adding drill pipe sections to the collar and is finally sealed to the receiver. With the bit slightly off the bottom of the borehole the pipe is rotated to give it a bow which will compensate for up and down movements of the vessel. Whilst the pipe is still rotating it is lowered until the bit begins to cut, a constant force being applied to the bit. During drilling, mud is supplied from the tank, down the drill pipe to the bit and is returned up the space between the pipe and the hole to the head from whence it passes through a drilling mud return line 55 to the tank. The drill pipe is withdrawn from the well by releasing the head from the receiver and hoisting the pipe, the bit engaging the shoulder within the head so that it is also hoisted. If drilling is to be discontinued in the event of a storm, a length of drill pipe slightly greater than the depth of the water is removed from the string, the remaining string is plugged by a tool affording a landing seat, and the remaining string is lowered until the tool seats on the circulating head. A well is completed by running the Xmas tree into the casing using the guide lines, sealing the tree to the casing, and connecting flexible hoses attached to the tree to the shore or a tanker. In the embodiment shown in Figs. 2 and 3 the arms 58 are connected to a sleeve 94 surrounding casing 92 which is screwed at its upper end to receiver 106 which also rests on an internal ring welded to the sleeve 94. The receiver has a slot 112 which facilitates raising and lowering of the casing and removal of the receiver from the casing. The circulating head has a sealing ring 117 which is contracted by hydraulic pressure to engage a groove 111 in the receiver. The drill pipe is resiliently gripped by a seal 190 rotatably mounted in the upper part of the head, the bearing supporting the seal being lubricated with water supplied through a port 151. A nipple 132 serves as the connection to a drilling mud return line.

The bit head has a cutting end and an opposite connecting end with an engagement section. The pin body comprises a connecting end with an engagement section. The pin connecting end is connected to the bit head connecting end such that the engagement sections overlap. The electrically insulating gap joint can fill a gap between the bit head and pin body engagement sections such that the bit head and pin body are mechanically connected together at the connecting ends but electrically separated. Alternatively or additionally, the pin body can have two pieces which are separated by an electrically insulating gap joint. An electrical conductor is electrically connected at a first end to the bit head and is communicable at a second end with an alternating current signal to transmit an alternating current into the bit head, thereby inducing an electric current into a reservoir formation adjacent the bit head. Electronic equipment includes measurement circuitry configured to determine the alternating current at the bit head, the alternating current being inversely proportional to a bit resistivity of the formation.",CLARK BRIAN;;TAHERIAN REZA;;LOGAN DEREK W;;HOLMEN GARRY;;DOPF ANTHONY R;;LOGAN AARON;;UTTER ROBERT;;SCHLUMBERGER TECHNOLOGY CORP,CLARK BRIAN;;TAHERIAN REZA;;LOGAN DEREK W;;HOLMEN GARRY;;DOPF ANTHONY R;;LOGAN AARON;;UTTER ROBERT,SCHLUMBERGER TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION (2011-11-09),https://lens.org/107-049-896-069-657,Granted Patent,yes,29,3,4,4,0,E21B10/00;;G01V3/24;;E21B47/13;;E21B17/0285;;E21B10/00;;E21B47/13;;E21B17/0285;;G01V3/24;;E21B45/00,E21B47/12;;E21B10/00;;G01V3/24,175/50;;175/40,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
