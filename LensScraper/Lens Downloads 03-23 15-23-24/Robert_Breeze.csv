    The present invention relates to a wall reinforcement system, in particular for tying a veneer wall ( 21 ) to a back up wall ( 22 ). The system can protect a building against adverse seismic or wind loading conditions. A helical wall tie ( 1 ) is driven into a back-up wall ( 22 ) using a percussion tool. A connector ( 10 ) is then placed over the end of the wall tie, the connector engaging with the helical fins to prevent its removal without unscrewing the connector ( 10 ). A reinforcement wire ( 20 ), which preferably extends around a building, is then threaded through a hole in the connector to lock the rotation of the connector ( 10 ). The reinforcement wire is used to link a series of connectors together. The wire is then encased in mortar ( 24 ) within the bed joint between two courses of bricks. In preferred embodiments, more than two reinforcement wires extend in parallel along the bed joint.

The wedge tie may have the same helical pitch as that of the main tie, or it may be a pitch somewhat tighter or shorter to not only fill the space between the host tie and the mortar, but wedgingly engage the same. The auxiliary wedge pin may be pointed at both ends, pointed at one end, or even blunt at both ends. Successful fixes have been made where one end is sheared, and has a relatively chisel-like end. The method of the invention is directed to the reinforcing of a tie in a wall reinforcing environment, where the outer portion of the tie passes through a softer material, and a subsequent reinforcement of the tie portion in the soft material becomes desirable.",HELIFIX LTD,PATERSON ROBERT IAN;;BREEZE BRIAN ALAN,,https://lens.org/042-816-421-405-168,Granted Patent,yes,0,8,5,8,0,B23B51/02;;B23B2251/241;;B23B2251/247;;B25F3/00;;E04G23/0222;;Y10T29/49881;;Y10T29/49959;;Y10T29/49881;;Y10T29/49959;;B25F3/00;;E04G23/0222;;B23B2251/241;;B23B2251/247;;B23B51/02,B23B51/02;;B25F3/00;;E04G23/02,173/1;;173/114;;173/202;;173/4;;29/456;;29/525.08,2,0,,,Helifix(R)Stainless Steel Retrofit Wall Tie System-A four (4) page brochure publication printed and distributed on Jan. 1993.;;Blok-Lok(R) Limited-Stainless Steel Retrofit Wall Tie System-A Four (4) page brochure publication printed and distributed on Jan. 1993.,EXPIRED
