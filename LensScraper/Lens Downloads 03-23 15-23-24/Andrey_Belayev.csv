A muscle-sensor is attached to the muscle group of a user and to a computing device in communication with a display device. As the user contracts and relaxes the muscle group, the contractions and relaxations are displayed in real-time on the display device. Such real-time display teaches the user to identify how to identify and exercise the muscle group and to set a goal as to how long the user is to hold the contraction. An external emotionally significant motivational visual stimulus may be programmed into the computing device to display the visual stimulus only when the goal as to the contraction is attained and maintained.",MIKHAILENOK EUGENE;;VORONINA OLGA;;POTAPOVA OLGA;;BELAYEV ANDREY,MIKHAILENOK EUGENE;;VORONINA OLGA;;POTAPOVA OLGA;;BELAYEV ANDREY,LUMINA BIOMEDICAL INC (2010-05-01),https://lens.org/140-243-771-816-802,Patent Application,yes,5,0,2,4,0,A61F5/41;;A61F5/41,A61F5/00,600/38,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
