The method includes the steps of depositing scented particles on one surface of the foam and dispersing the particles within the foam by supplying heat to the foam and applying a vacuum to the opposite surface of the foam. Fragrance or fragrance particles may also be added directly to the foam during its manufacture and a semi-permeable film or fabric may also be affixed to the scented porous foam product to retard and thus extend the release of the fragrance. In a preferred embodiment, frangible encapsulated particles of fragrance are used so that the encapsulated fragrance is retained within the foam until it is later utilized and subject to external forces which break the capsule to release the fragrance.",SCOTTDEL INC,CARSON III WILLIAM S;;CARSON LOUIS A;;CARSON CHRISTOPHER E;;FRIEDRICH LARRY,,https://lens.org/090-367-398-419-78X,Granted Patent,yes,16,87,1,1,0,A61K8/046;;A61K8/11;;A61K2800/412;;A61L9/042;;A61Q13/00;;B32B7/02;;Y10S428/905;;Y10T428/2984;;Y10T428/25;;Y10T428/31551;;Y10T428/249981;;Y10T428/249986;;Y10T428/23979;;Y10T428/2984;;Y10T428/25;;Y10T428/31551;;Y10T428/249981;;Y10T428/249986;;Y10T428/23979;;B32B5/18;;B32B3/26;;B32B27/065;;B32B2264/00;;B32B2471/02;;A61L9/042;;A61Q13/00;;A61K8/046;;A61K2800/412;;B32B7/02;;A61K8/11;;Y10S428/905,A61K8/04;;A61K8/11;;A61L9/04;;A61Q13/00;;B32B7/02,B5N N175          S           12;;B5N N177          S           12;;B5N N180          S           12;;B5N N195          S           11;;B5N N195          S           12;;B5N N196          S           11;;B5N N196          S           12;;B5N N207          S           11;;B5N N207          S           12;;B5N N209          S           11;;B5N N21Y          S           12;;B5N N210          S           11;;B5N N221          S           12;;B5N N223          S           11;;B5N N223          S           12;;B5N N225          S           11;;B5N N247          S           11;;B5N N255          S           12;;B5N N259          S           12;;B5N N26X          S           12;;B5N N260          S           12;;B5N N281          S           12;;B5N N283          S           12;;B5N N286          S           12;;B5N N29X          S           12;;B5N N455          S           11;;B5N N455          S           12;;B5N N46Y          S           11;;B5N N46Y          S           12;;B5N N501          S           11;;B5N N501          S           12;;B5N N502          S           11;;B5N N502          S           12;;B5N N504          S           11;;B5N N504          S           12;;B5N N519          S           11;;B5N N519          S           12;;B5N N52X          S           11;;B5N N52X          S           12;;B5N N528          S           11;;B5N N528          S           12;;B5N N549          S           11;;B5N N549          S           12;;B5N N554          S           11;;B5N N554          S           12;;B5N N577          S           11;;B5N N577          S           12;;B5N N595          S           11;;B5N N595          S           12;;B5N N597          S           11;;B5N N597          S           12;;B5N N601          S           11;;B5N N601          S           12;;B5N N606          S           11;;B5N N606          S           12;;B5N N607          S           11;;B5N N607          S           12;;B5N N612          S           11;;B5N N612          S           12;;B5N N615          S           11;;B5N N615          S           12;;B5N N622          S           11;;B5N N622          S           12;;B5N N625          S           11;;B5N N625          S           12;;B5N N631          S           11;;B5N N631          S           12;;B5N N632          S           11;;B5N N632          S           12;;B5N N633          S           11;;B5N N633          S           12;;B5N N635          S           11;;B5N N635          S           12;;B5N N648          S           11;;B5N N648          S           12;;B5N N650          S           11;;B5N N650          S           12;;B5N N658          S           11;;B5N N658          S           12;;B5N N66Y          S           11;;B5N N66Y          S           12;;B5N N660          S           11;;B5N N660          S           12;;B5N N661          S           11;;B5N N661          S           12;;B5N N662          S           11;;B5N N662          S           12;;B5N N667          S           11;;B5N N667          S           12;;B5N N668          S           11,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
