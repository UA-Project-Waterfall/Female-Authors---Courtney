    A method for determining an HLA genotype of a subject is disclosed. The method comprises (a) isolating template nucleic acid from the subject; (b) amplifying the template nucleic acid to generate sufficient product for each allele of at least one gene locus to be determined; (c) hybridizing the template nucleic acid with an immobilized array of capture oligonucleotides, each having a known nucleic acid sequence of an HLA allele; and (d) determining the particular capture oligonucleotide to which the template nucleic acid hybridizes, thereby determining the genotype of the subject.

   A method for determining an HLA genotype of a subject is disclosed. The method comprises (a) isolating template nucleic acid from the subject; (b) amplifying the template nucleic acid to generate sufficient product for each allele of at least one gene locus to be determined; (c) hybridizing the template nucleic acid with an immobilized array of capture oligonucleotides, each having a known nucleic acid sequence of an HLA allele; and (d) determining the particular capture oligonucleotide to which the template nucleic acid hybridizes, thereby determining the genotype of the subject. A number of additional methods that can eliminate or abbreviate additional steps are also described. Moreover, the present invention provides a method for determining tissue compatibility using the determined HLA genotype.

The method includes: detecting a limited automatic repeat request (LARQ) header in a frame with a priority tag; stripping the LARQ header and a frame check sequence (FCS) in the frame with the priority tag; recalculating the FCS for the stripped frame with the priority tag; and adding the recalculated FCS to the stripped frame with the priority tag. The method strips the LARQ header from a HPNA frame with the priority tag before it is sent to an Ethernet controller. By stripping the LARQ header, the Ethernet controller will correctly recognize the priority tag and send the frame to the appropriate priority queue.

One key concept that allows the compression unit to operate in real time is that the architecture and pipe lining both allow for B frames to be executed out of order.

   The present invention provides a method for supporting frame priority in a home phone line network. The method includes: detecting a limited automatic repeat request (LARQ) header in a frame with a priority tag; stripping the LARQ header and a frame check sequence (FCS) in the frame with the priority tag; recalculating the FCS for the stripped frame with the priority tag; and adding the recalculated FCS to the stripped frame with the priority tag. The method strips the LARQ header from a HPNA frame with the priority tag before it is sent to an Ethernet controller. By stripping the LARQ header, the Ethernet controller will correctly recognize the priority tag and send the frame to the appropriate priority queue. In this manner, frame priority is supported.

The apparatus comprises a serializer for each channel. Serialized data is transmitted across the midplane to a deserializer at the destination. Sequential cells are sent in different channels. Cell ordering is preserved by staggering the start of cell transmission in the channels. The invention permits data to be transmitted across a mid plane using a reduced number of data lines. The data stream on each card may be carried in a wide bus at a relatively low clock rate.

The apparatus comprises a serializer for each channel. Serialized data is transmitted across the midplane to a deserializer at the destination. Sequential cells are sent in different channels. Cell ordering is preserved by staggering the start of cell transmission in the channels. The invention permits data to be transmitted across a mid plane using a reduced number of data lines. The data stream on each card may be carried in a wide bus at a relatively low clock rate. Apparatus according to the invention may be used to transmit an OC-192 data stream across a pin-limited interface.,ALCATEL CANADA INC,KENDALL CHAD;;CHOW JOEY;;NESBITT ROBERT J,ALCATEL-LUCENT CANADA INC (2013-07-23),https://lens.org/033-512-217-039-958,Search Report,yes,3,0,8,8,0,H04J2203/0025;;H04J2203/0076;;H04L49/3081;;H04L2012/565;;H04L2012/5672;;H04L2012/568;;H04Q11/0478;;H04L49/3081;;H04L2012/565;;H04L2012/568;;H04L2012/5672;;H04J2203/0025;;H04J2203/0076;;H04Q11/0478,H04L12/56;;H04Q11/04,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

This was accomplished by physically vapor depositing a polymer material, such as bulk Teflon AF2400, for example, to form thin layers that have a very low refractive index (.about.1.10-1.31) and are highly transparent from the ultra-violet through the near infrared regime, and maintain the low refractive index of the bulk material. The refractive index can be varied by simply varying one process parameter, either the deposition rate or the substrate temperature. The thus forming coatings may be utilized in anti-reflectors and graded anti-reflection coatings, as well as in optical layers for laser-resistant coatings at optical wavelengths of less than about 2000 nm.",UNIV CALIFORNIA,CHOW ROBERT;;LOOMIS GARY E;;THOMAS IAN M,LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL SECURITY LLC (2008-06-23),https://lens.org/005-773-765-546-483,Granted Patent,yes,11,50,1,1,0,C23C18/00;;H01J1/70;;Y10T428/24942;;Y10T428/26;;Y10T428/31;;Y10T428/265;;Y10T428/31504;;Y10T428/3154;;Y10T428/31544;;Y10T428/24942;;Y10T428/26;;Y10T428/31;;Y10T428/265;;Y10T428/31504;;Y10T428/3154;;Y10T428/31544;;C23C18/00;;H01J1/70,C23C18/00;;H01J1/70,428/212;;428/332;;428/336;;428/409;;428/411.1;;428/421;;428/422;;359/580;;359/586;;359/601,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Network and protocol conversion between the wired/wireless network and the ATM network is performed by a gateway (GAGW) having capabilities to perform this function. A mobility server platform (MSP) handles routing between the gateways to other networks and the micro-mobility functions of the wireless base stations directly connected to the ATM network. A Inter-working function (IWF) element connects base stations (BS) or mobile switching centers (MSC) to ATM switch/routers and in the process provides various protocol conversions necessary to integrate various services into the ATM backbone.

The separation buffer is provided such that, at the time of detection, the detergent concentration in the buffer is not above the critical micelle concentration. The polypeptide is introduced into one end of the capillary channel. An electric field is applied across a length of the capillary channel, which transports polypeptides of different sizes through the polymer solution at different rates. The polypeptide is then detected as it passes a point along the length of the capillary channel.

Some embodiments may include encrypting, by a client device using a public key, authentication information provided by a user. The encrypted authentication information is sent to a cloud based service which then sends it to an on-premises component residing behind a firewall of an enterprise. The on-premises component decrypts the authentication information using a private key, validates the authentication information, and returns the result to the cloud based service over a network. If validated, the cloud based service establishes a secure connection between the client device and the on-premises component such that the user can access the enterprise's content without the enterprise having to share the authentication information with the cloud based service.",SAILPOINT TECHNOLOGIES INC,FORSTER CRAIG ROBERT WILLIAM;;GREFF DANIEL THOMAS;;CHOW CRANDALL B T;;GOLDENBURG PHILLIP,SAILPOINT TECHNOLOGIES INC (2014-06-24),https://lens.org/175-771-738-682-709,Patent Application,yes,13,4,6,6,0,H04L63/029;;H04L63/0428;;G06F21/31;;G06F2221/2115;;H04L63/08;;H04L9/30;;H04L63/0272;;H04L63/029;;H04L63/0428;;G06F21/31;;G06F2221/2115;;H04L63/08;;H04L63/061,H04L9/30;;H04L29/06,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

    A method for providing a local cordless service comprises the steps of receiving subscriber neighborhood zone selection input so that a mobile telephone equipped subscriber may place or receive calls for a fixed rate, for example, per month without having to pay radio frequency air time charges any time they are located within their selected subscribed-to zones. If the subscribed-to zones are adjacent to one another and the mobile subscriber roams from one zone to another, the subscriber may continue their free call uninterrupted and without paying air time charges. However, when the subscriber roams outside their subscribed-to zones they may be switched from the present local cordless services to conventional personal communications services and pay air time charges. However for an active call, no air-time charges are incurred as the user transitions between the cellular/DPCS environment and the local cordless service environment. Associated apparatus comprises an IBS for automatically changing radio frequency channels as the subscriber roams within a subscribed-to neighborhood zone, roams to another subscribed-to zone or roams outside a subscribed-to zone. Subscribers may choose to use their mobile identification number, their current directory telephone number for wired public switched telephone service or obtain a new directory number.

This processing involves inserting .PHI. functions for expressions where different values of the expressions reach common points in the computer program. A result of each of the .PHI. functions is stored in a hypothetical variable h. The processing also involves a renaming step where SSA versions are assigned to hypothetical variables h in the computer program, a down safety step of determining whether each .PHI. function in the computer program is down safe, and a will be available step of determining whether each expression in the computer program will be available at each .PHI. function following eventual insertion of code into the computer program for purposes of partial redundancy elimination. The processing also includes a finalize step of transforming the SSA representation of the computer program having hypothetical variables h to a SSA graph that includes some insertion information reflecting eventual insertions of code into the computer program for purposes of partial redundancy elimination, and a code motion step of updating the SSA graph based on the insertion information to introduce real temporary variables t for the hypothetical variables h.",SILICON GRAPHICS INC,CHOW FREDERICK;;CHAN SUN;;KENNEDY ROBERT;;LIU SHIN-MING;;LO RAYMOND;;TU PENG,MORGAN STANLEY & CO.

   A method for providing a local cordless service comprises the steps of receiving subscriber neighborhood zone selection input so that a mobile telephone equipped subscriber may place or receive calls for a fixed rate, for example, per month without having to pay radio frequency air time charges any time they are located within their selected subscribed-to zones. If the subscribed-to zones are adjacent to one another and the mobile subscriber roams from one zone to another, the subscriber may continue their free call uninterrupted and without paying air time charges. However, when the subscriber roams outside their subscribed-to zones they may be switched from the present local cordless services to conventional personal communications services and pay air time charges. However for an active call, no air-time charges are incurred as the user transitions between the cellular/DPCS environment and the local cordless service environment. Associated apparatus comprises an IBS for automatically changing radio frequency channels as the subscriber roams within a subscribed-to neighborhood zone, roams to another subscribed-to zone or roams outside a subscribed-to zone. Subscribers may choose to use their mobile identification number, their current directory telephone number for wired public switched telephone service or obtain a new directory number.

Based on the observation that the circumstances for promoting a memory location's value to register coincide with situations where the program exhibits partial redundancy between accesses to the memory location, the system is an approach to register promotion that models the optimization as two separate problems: (1) the partial redundancy elimination (PRE) of loads and (2) the PRE of stores. Both of these problems are solved through a sparse approach to PRE. The static single assignment PRE (SSAPRE) method for eliminating partial redundancy using a sparse SSA representation representations the foundation in eliminating redundancy among memory accesses, enabling the achievement of both computational and live range optimality in register promotion results. A static single use (SSU) representation is defined allowing the dual of the SSAPRE algorithm, called SSUPRE, to perform the partial redundancy elimination of stores. SSUPRE is performed after the PRE of loads, taking advantage of the loads' having been converted into pseudo-register references so that there are fewer barriers to the movement of stores. Consequently, the compiler produces more efficient, register-promoted executable program code from the SSA representation.",SILICON GRAPHICS INC,CHOW FREDERICK;;KENNEDY ROBERT;;LIU SHIN-MING;;LO RAYMOND;;TU PENG;;CHAN SUN C,MORGAN STANLEY & CO.

On the other hand, if the packet data does not contain the particular bit pattern indicated by the filter expression, the wireless device assembly does not communicate the wakeup signal to the host assembly.",MARVELL INT LTD,CHOW LONG;;JAN JAMES KANG-WUU;;LEE ROBERT;;FAN CHEN;;LUO XIAOHUA;;HUANG FRANK,MARVELL ASIA PTE LTD (2019-12-31);;CAVIUM INTERNATIONAL (2019-12-31),https://lens.org/149-916-700-280-140,Granted Patent,yes,8,1,4,4,0,H04W52/0229;;H04W52/0229;;H04L43/028;;H04L69/22;;H04L69/22;;Y02D30/70;;Y02D30/70,G08C17/00;;H04W52/02,,22,9,097-149-921-182-350;;097-149-921-182-350;;059-413-198-109-649;;084-652-536-946-621;;183-296-878-565-985;;183-296-878-565-985;;143-053-757-692-219;;088-947-469-652-706;;088-947-469-652-706,10.1109/ieeestd.2008.4726975;;10.1109/ieeestd.2008.4726975;;10.1109/ieeestd.2003.94392;;10.1535/itj.1002.05;;10.1109/ieeestd.2017.7920364;;10.1109/ieeestd.2017.7920364;;10.1007/s11277-006-9073-2;;10.1109/ieeestd.2006.218738;;10.1109/ieeestd.2006.218738,"Draft Supplement to Standard [for] Information Technology-Telecommunications and information exchange between systems-Local and metropolitan area networks-Specific requirements-Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) specifications: Further Higher Data Rate Extension in the 2.4 GHz Band, IEEE P802.11g/D8.2 (Apr. 2003).;;Information technology-Telecommunications and information exchange between systems-Local and metropolitan area networks-Specific requirements-Part 3 (Section Three): Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications, IEEE Std 802-3 (2002).;;Information technology-Telecommunications and information exchange between systems-Local and metropolitan area networks-Specific requirements-Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) specifications, International Standard, ISO/IEC 8802-11, ANSI/IEEE Std. 802.11 (1999).;;Information technology-Telecommunications and information exchange between systems-Local and metropolitan area networks-Specific requirements-Part 3 (Section Two): Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications, IEEE Std 802-3 (2002).;;Information technology-Telecommunications and information exchange between systems-Local and metropolitan area networks-Specific requirements-Part 3: Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications (2002).;;Intel Centrino Mobile Technology Wake on Wireless LAN (WoWLAN) Feature, Technical Brief (2006).;;Magic Packet Technolgy, White Paper, AMD (1995).;;Supplement to IEEE Standard for Information technology-Telecommunications and information exchange between systems-Local and metropolitan area networks-Specific requirements-Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) specifications: Higher-Speed Physical Layer Extension in the 2.4 GHz Band, IEEE Std 802.11b (1999).;;Supplement to IEEE Standard for Information technology-Telecommunications and information exchange between systems-Local and metropolitan area networks-Specific requirements-Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) specifications: Higher-Speed Physical Layer in the 5 Ghz Band, IEEE Std 802.11a (1999).;;TGn Sync Proposal Technical Specification, IEEE P802.11 Wireless LANs, Abstract (2005).;;IEEE Std 802.11b-1999/Cor 1-2001 (Corrigendum to IEEE Std 802.11b-1999) ""IEEE Standard for Information technology-Telecommunications and information exchange between systems-Local and metropolitan area networks-Specific requirements, Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) specifications, Amendment 2: Higher-speed Physical Layer (PHY) extension in the 2.4 GHz band-Corrigendum 1,"" The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc., 23 pages, Nov. 7, 2001.;;IEEE Std 802.11g/D2.8, May 2002 (Supplement to ANSI/IEEE Std 802.11, 1999 Edition) Draft Supplement to Standard [for] Information technology-Telecommunications and information exchange between systems-Local and metropolitan area networks-Specific requirements-Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) specifications: Further Higher-Speed Physical Layer Extension in the 2.4 GHz Band, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc., May 2002.;;IEEE Std P802.11-REVma/06.0, ""Unapproved Draft Standard for Information Technology-Telecommunications and information exchange between systems-Local and metropolitan area network-Specific requirements Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) specifications.

In the preferred embodiment, hydrolytically stable polyphosphazenes are formed of monomers having carboxylic acid side groups that are crosslinked by divalent or trivalent cations such as Ca 2+ or Al3+, then stabilized with a polycation such as poly-L-lysine. A variety of different compositions can be formed from the crosslinked polymer.

BROADCAST AND ALTERNATE MESSAGE TIME SLOT INTERCHANGE It is common that communications such as telephone calls between calling and called lines be made by sharing a single communications path on a time division basis. Each call is assigned to a shared path for a short time interval, also called a time slot. It is known to interchange an input time slot to a different output time slot. Unfortunately, known time slot interchange arrangements insert an input sample in a single output time slot. The instant time slot interchanger extends an input sample onto a plurality of output time slots for broadcasting a sample through a plurality of locations. Also, the instant time slot interchanger may selectively insert an alternate message, e.g., an error message, in an output time slot.",WESTERN ELECTRIC CO,ABBOTT ROBERT P;;CHOW MING-CHWAN;;CIRILLO ANTHONY J;;DRECHSLER RUDOLPH C;;HORNEY LEE F II,,https://lens.org/066-004-368-845-582,Granted Patent,no,0,0,7,8,0,H04Q11/08;;H04Q11/08,H04J3/00;;H04J3/16;;H04Q11/04;;H04Q11/08,363-1,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   Embolectomy catheters, rapid exchange microcatheters, systems and methods for removing clots or other obstructive matter (e.g., thrombus, thromboemboli, embolic fragments of atherosclerotic plaque, foreign objects, etc.) from blood vessels. This invention is particularly useable for percutaneous removal of thromboemboli or other obstructive matter from small blood vessels of the brain, during an evolving stroke or period of cerebral ischemia. In some embodiments, the embolectomy catheters of this invention are advanceable with or over a guidewire which has been pre-inserted through or around the clot. Also, in some embodiments, the embolectomy catheters include clot removal devices which are deployable from the catheter after the catheter has been advanced at least partially through the clot. The clot removal device may include a deployable wire nest that is designed to prevent a blood clot from passing therethrough. The delivery catheter may include telescoping inner and outer tubes, with the clot removal device being radially constrained by the outer tube. Retraction of the outer tube removes the constraint on the clot removal device and permits it to expand to its deployed configuration. An infusion guidewire is particularly useful in conjunction with the embolectomy catheter, and permits infusion of medicaments or visualization fluids distal to the clot.

This invention is particularly useable for percuatneous removal of thromboemboli or other obstructive matter from small blood vessels of the brain, during an evolving stroke or period of cerebral ischemia. In some embodiments, the embolectomy catheters (10, 10', 10"", 10""', 10"""") of this invention are advanceable with or over a guidewire (GW) which has been pre-inserted through or around the clot. Also, in some embodiments, the embolectomy catheters include clot removal devices which are deployable from the catheter after the catheter has been advanced at least partially through the clot. The clot removal device may include a deployable wire nest (14) that is designed to prevent a blood clot from passing therethrough. The delivery catheter may include telescoping inner and outer tubes, with the clot removal device being radially constrained by the outer tube. Retraction of the outer tube removes the constraint on the clot removal device and permits it to expand to its deployed configuration. An infusion guidewire is particularly useful in conjunction with the embolectomy catheter, and permits infusion of medicants or visualization fluids distal to the clot.",MICROVENTION INC,ROSENBLUTH ROBERT F;;GREEN GEORGE R;;COX BRIAN J;;STERNWEILER THOMAS R;;CHOW SEAN L;;MONETTI RICHARD R,,https://lens.org/199-894-613-385-306,Granted Patent,no,0,0,16,16,0,A61B17/22;;A61B17/221;;A61B17/320725;;A61B17/32075;;A61B2017/00367;;A61B2017/00778;;A61B2017/22034;;A61B2017/22038;;A61B2017/22042;;A61B2017/22044;;A61B2017/22084;;A61B2017/2212;;A61M25/0068;;A61M25/008;;A61M2025/109,A61M25/00;;A61B17/00;;A61B17/22;;A61M29/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   An apparatus and method for performing two-pass real time video compression is provided. Tactical decisions such as encoding and quantization values are determined in software, whereas functional execution steps are performed in hardware. By appropriately apportioning the tasks between software and hardware, the benefits of each type of processing are exploited, while minimizing both hardware complexity and data transfer requirements. One key concept that allows the compression unit to operate in real time is that the architecture and pipelining both allow for B frames to be executed out of order. By buffering B frames, two-pass motion estimation techniques can be performed to tailor bit usage to the requirements of the frame, and therefore provide a more appealing output image.

The upper portion of the single resist layer can be converted into a dry-etch resistant form. The conversion can be a blanket conversion of the upper portion of the resist layer or can be a patterned conversion of areas within the upper portion of the layer. A patternwise-converted resist can be oxygen plasma developed. The upper portion of the single resist layer can be patternwise converted into a chemically different composition or structure having altered absorptivity toward radiation. The difference in radiation absorptivity within the patterned upper portion of the resist enables subsequent use of blanket irradiation of the resist surface to create differences in chemical solubility between areas having the altered absorptivity toward radiation and non-altered areas. The difference in chemical solubility enables wet development of the patterned resist.,IBM,ALLEN ROBERT D;;CHIONG KAOLIN N;;CHOW MING-FEA;;MACDONALD SCOTT A;;YANG JER-MING;;WILLSON CARLTON G,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (1986-06-24),https://lens.org/018-818-486-862-684,Granted Patent,yes,10,49,6,6,0,G03F7/265;;G03F7/265;;G03F7/038;;G03F7/038;;G03F7/2022;;G03F7/2022;;Y10S430/143;;Y10S430/143;;Y10S430/167;;Y10S430/167;;Y10S430/168;;Y10S430/168,H01L21/027;;G03F7/038;;G03F7/20;;G03F7/26;;G03F7/38,430/18;;430/325;;430/311;;430/313;;430/323;;430/331;;430/296;;430/299;;430/942;;430/966;;430/967;;430/272;;430/190;;430/193;;156/643;;427/54.1;;427/53.1;;427/44;;427/35;;427/36;;427/38,4,2,089-207-991-843-92X;;036-483-269-452-903,10.1116/1.571214;;10.1149/1.2115932,"T.

    An apparatus and method for performing two-pass real time video compression is provided. Tactical decisions such as encoding and quantization values are determined in software, whereas functional execution steps are performed in hardware. By appropriately apportioning the tasks between software and hardware, the benefits of each type of processing are exploited, while minimizing both hardware complexity and data transfer requirements. One key concept that allows the compression unit to operate in real time is that the architecture and pipelining both allow for B frames to be executed out of order. By buffering B frames, two-pass motion estimation techniques can be performed to tailor bit usage to the requirements of the frame, and therefore provide a more appealing output image.

By appropriately apportioning the tasks between software and hardware, the benefits of each type of processing are exploited, while minimizing both hardware complexity and data transfer requirements. One key concept that allows the compression unit to operate in real time is that the architecture and pipelining both allow for B frames to be executed out of order. By buffering B frames, two-pass motion estimation techniques can be performed to tailor bit usage to the requirements of the frame, and thereby provide a more appealing output image.",COMPAQ COMPUTER CORP,ADILETTA MATTHEW JAMES;;CHOW KING-WAI;;HO SAMUEL WILLIAM;;ROSE ROBERT CLINT;;WHEELER WILLIAM RALPH;;GALBI DUANE E,COMPAQ INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES GROUP L.P (1999-12-09);;DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION (1996-06-19);;HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT LP (2015-10-27);;HEWLETT-PACKARD DEVELOPMENT COMPANY L.P (2002-10-01),https://lens.org/114-258-082-497-921,Granted Patent,yes,3,130,5,5,0,H04N19/159;;H04N19/176;;H04N19/46;;H04N19/51;;H04N19/149;;H04N19/61;;H04N19/114;;H04N19/124;;H04N19/127;;H04N19/132;;H04N19/14;;H04N19/177;;H04N19/82;;H04N19/42;;H04N19/31;;H04N19/423;;H04N19/436;;H04N19/587;;H04N19/87;;H04N19/93;;H04N19/577;;H04N19/577;;H04N19/176;;H04N19/87;;H04N19/124;;H04N19/149;;H04N19/61;;H04N19/587;;H04N19/42;;H04N19/14;;H04N19/114;;H04N19/51;;H04N19/159;;H04N19/423;;H04N19/82;;H04N19/127;;H04N19/31;;H04N19/436;;H04N19/93;;H04N19/46;;H04N19/132;;H04N19/177,G06T9/00;;H04N7/12;;H04N7/26;;H04N7/32;;H04N7/36;;H04N7/46;;H04N7/50,382/236;;348/415,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

This invention is particularly useable for percuatneous removal of thromboemboli or other obstructive matter from small blood vessels of the brain, during an evolving stroke or period of cerebral ischemia. In some embodiments, the embolectomy catheters (10, 10', 10'', 10''', 10'''') of this invention are advanceable with or over a guidewire (GW) which has been pre-inserted through or around the clot. Also, in some embodiments, the embolectomy catheters include clot removal devices which are deployable from the catheter after the catheter has been advanced at least partially through the clot. The clot removal device may include a deployable wire nest (14) that is designed to prevent a blood clot from passing therethrough.

The router will then convert the packet data to a format usable by the wireless data network that the wireless communications device is currently using for wireless access. After conversion, the router will perform actual transmission of the packet data to the correct destination wireless network. Once the converted packet data is received by the wireless network base station, it will be transmitted via RF to the destination wireless communications device.

Two network elements compose the physical apparatus, a protocol converter and a router. Upon receiving packet data from a fixed communications device, a router will locate a destination wireless communications device. The router will then convert the packet data to a format usable by the wireless data network that the wireless communications device is currently using for wireless access. After conversion, the router will perform actual transmission of the packet data to the correct destination wireless network. Once the converted packet data is received by the wireless network base station, it will be transmitted via RF to the destination wireless communications device. The router will also perform reverse functions of receiving packet data from a wireless communications device across wireless data network and then perform necessary conversion to a format usable by fixed communications device.

By the present method and package, the maximum amount of product that can be dispensed is limited to a single metered dose after each uncapping of the package. Specifically, the metered dispensing system is configured to allow dispensing of only a single metered dose of a liquid, viscous liquid, gel, paste, or semi-solid product contained in the package and to prevent further dispensing of additional doses of product until at least one specific and deliberate step is taken that re-activates or re-engages the dispensing system.

   A method for management of performance of computer systems and applications includes prompting the user to select information for monitoring, monitoring the performance of applications running on servers, displaying data, and prompting users to input performance adjustments. A user is prompted to select a server or server group, a resource, and a threshold or condition for notification, and in response a system compares the value or quality of the parameter to the threshold or condition, and provides a notification to the user in the event that the parameter reaches the threshold or condition. A method includes the steps of providing the user with performance information, receiving from the user a request for more specific performance information, and providing more detailed performance information. A method according to the invention includes the steps of receiving from the user an identification of a server as an authoritative server, another server as a comparison server, comparing runtime environment data in the form of one or more of CPU data, server data and Java data between the selected servers, and displaying differences to a user. A method of the invention includes the steps of receiving from the user an identification of a server as an authoritative server, and another server as a comparison server, and providing a list of matching and differing file names. The method may further include the step of receiving from the user a selection of a file, conducting a comparison of the files, and providing a result to the user. A method of the invention includes the steps of assigning a role to each user, and mapping between access to functions and each user role by an access control list, whereby access to functions is limited depending on the assigned role of the user.

A user is prompted to select a server or server group, a resource, and a threshold or condition for notification, and in response a system compares the value or quality of the parameter to the threshold or condition, and provides a notification to the user in the event that the parameter reaches the threshold or condition. A method includes the steps of providing the user with performance information, receiving from the user a request for more specific performance information, and providing more detailed performance information. A method according to the invention includes the steps of receiving from the user an identification of a server as an authoritative server, another server as a comparison server, comparing runtime environment data in the form of one or more of CPU data, server data and Java data between the selected servers, and displaying differences to a user. A method of the invention includes the steps of receiving from the user an identification of a server as an authoritative server, and another server as a comparison server, and providing a list of matching and differing file names. The method may further include the step of receiving from the user a selection of a file, conducting a comparison of the files, and providing a result to the user.

A user is prompted to select a server or server group, a resource, and a threshold or condition for notification, and in response a system compares the value or quality of the parameter to the threshold or condition, and provides a notification to the user in the event that the parameter reaches the threshold or condition. A method includes the steps of providing the user with performance information, receiving from the user a request for more specific performance information, and providing more detailed performance information. A method according to the invention includes the steps of receiving from the user an identification of a server as an authoritative server, another server as a comparison server, comparing runtime environment data in the form of one or more of CPU data, server data and Java data between the selected servers, and displaying differences to a user. A method of the invention includes the steps of receiving from the user an identification of a server as an authoritative server, and another server as a comparison server, and providing a list of matching and differing file names. The method may further include the step of receiving from the user a selection of a file, conducting a comparison of the files, and providing a result to the user. A method of the invention includes the steps of assigning a role to each user, and mapping between access to functions and each user role by an access control list, whereby access to functions is limited depending on the assigned role of the user.",IBM,CHONG JAMES C;;CHAN JOSEPH L;;PATEL TUSHAR M;;HELER JEAN JACQUES;;SO CHI HONG;;TSANG ARTHUR;;LAM ROBERT S;;CHOW RAYMOND;;BANKS JEROME D;;ZYCHOWSKI CHRISTOPHER M;;TANG HENRY,CYANEA SYSTEMS CORPORATION (2004-09-11);;CYANEA SYSTEMS CORP (2003-10-10);;INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (2005-05-16),https://lens.org/146-531-347-585-579,Granted Patent,yes,53,45,20,20,0,G06F11/3006;;G06F11/3072;;G06F11/328;;G06F11/3476;;G06F11/3495;;G06F2201/81;;G06F2201/865;;G06F2201/88;;G06F11/3409;;G06F16/11;;H04L43/08;;G06F15/16;;G06F11/34;;G06F15/00;;G06F15/173;;H04L43/08;;G06F16/11;;G06F11/3006;;G06F11/3072;;G06F11/328;;G06F11/3476;;G06F11/3495;;G06F2201/81;;G06F2201/865;;G06F2201/88;;G06F11/3409;;H04L43/08;;H04L67/06;;H04L67/10,G06F/;;G06F15/173;;G06F11/32;;G06F11/34;;G06F15/00;;G06F15/16,709/224;;709/225;;370/467;;370/401;;370/232;;379/115;;379/119;;379/229;;379/90.1,64,1,099-677-859-185-56X,10.1147/sj.333.0426,"PCT Notification of Transmittal of the International Search Report and Written Opinion of the International Searching Authority, or the Declaration mailed Jun. 7, 2005, PCT/US04/26597, filed Aug. 16, 2004.;;Response to Written Opinion and Request for Correction of Description and Drawings dated Apr. 22, 2005, for application PCT/US04/26597, filed Aug. 16, 2004.;;PCT Notification of International Search Report or the Declaration, dated Oct. 23, 2003, for application PCT/US03/10459, filed Apr. 8, 2003.;;International Search Report dated Oct. 23, 2003 for application WO 03/087982 A3 published Oct. 23, 2003.;;Supplementary European Search Report dated Jan. 1, 2006 for application EP 03742215.;;M.A. Bauer, et al., ""Reference Architecture for Distributed Systems Management"", IBM Systems Journal, vol. 33, No. 3, 1994, pp. 426-444.;;PCT International Preliminary Examination Report, Feb. 17, 2005, for International Application No. PCT/US03/20109.;;PCT International Search Report, Nov. 24, 2004, for International Application No. PCT/US03/20109.;;U.S. Appl.

   Multilayered web stock is directed toward a curved surface and at least one layer of the web stock is heated to a temperature above a glass transition temperature of the at least one layer of the web stock. The heating can occur just before or upon engaging the curved surface. The temperature of the at least one layer remains above the glass transition temperature while engaging the curved surface, allowing reshaping and/or realignment of the at least one layer relative to other layers of the web stock according to conformance to the curved surface. The web stock is cooled before it disengages from the curved surface. The heating can be done with a high power infrared lamp focused into a line across the web stock, and the cooling can be done with a cooled fluid jet. Additionally, a preheater can be employed, and a supplemental cooler can be used.
