Fig. 1 shows a longitudinal section of a steamship with the engines and boilers placed in the stern. A is the cargo hopper which is entirely open but may have fixed or removable hatch beams G, Fig. 3. When the engines are amidships, two or more hoppers are provided. If desired the vessel may have a longitudinal bulkhead with a hopper on each side. As shown in the cross section, Fig. 3, the sides E of the hopper are vertical but they may be inclined or curved. A traveller L supporting a digging appliance runs on rails on the hatchway or on the weather deck. A housing may be provided for the traveller when not in use. To compensate for the absence of hold and deck beams, the hopper sides are made of great strength, and they are connected to the vessel's sides by heavy scantlings and thick deck plating. The vessel's sides are also strengthened. The spaces between the hopper and the vessel's sides may be used as water-ballast tanks. The invention is equally applicable to dumb barges and other vessels having no propelling machines.",CAMPBELL JAMES,CAMPBELL JAMES,,https://lens.org/190-074-883-642-711,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The oil-insoluble metal compound is preferably formed in situ by reacting the oil solution of the organic acid after removal of suspended solids with excess metal base and then treating the reaction mixture with an acidic compound such as CO2. The basic oil-soluble metal salt may be isolated from the oil solution, e.g. by distilling the oil, and may then be dissolved in a different oil. The neutral water - miscible oxygen - containing organic solvent is preferably chosen from aliphatic alcohols, glycols or ketones containing not more than 6 carbon atoms, such as methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol or acetone, but others such as ethers, e.g. diisopropyl ether, methyl and ethyl ethers of ethylene glycol, 1,3-dioxane or 1,4-dioxane, and esters, e.g. ethyl lactate, may be used. The solvent may contain minor amounts of acidic or basic material. The acid used in the acidification step is preferably inorganic, e.g. sulphuric acid, but may be an organic acid containing 3 or less carbon atoms, e.g. propionic or acetic acid. The term ""oil"" is used to mean a neutral liquid which is not miscible with water such as liquid hydrocarbons, e.g. benzene, toluene, xylene, pentane, heptane and petroleum fractions from gasoline up to lubricating oils. If a suitable oil is used in the reaction, the product may be added directly to a lubricating oil. The products after removal of the oil used during the reaction may be incorporated in synthetic lubricants such as polymerised olefins, alkylated aromatic hydrocarbons, polysiloxanes, fluorocarbons or esters or fatty oils. Specified starting material organic acid salts include sodium, potassium, ammonium or polyvalent metal salts of sulphonic (e.g. petroleum sulphonic), carboxylic (e.g. aromatic or naphthenic) and phosphorus-containing or phosphorus- and sulphur-containing acids. The basic salts prepared in the invention may contain ammonium, monovalent metals such as sodium, potassium, or lithium, or polyvalent metals such as the alkaline earth metals (especially calcium and barium), magnesium, zinc, lead, aluminium, copper, tin, cobalt, nickel and manganese. The oil-insoluble metal compound formed in situ is preferably a carbonate, but may be, for example, a sulphide, sulphite or salt of an organic acid containing not more than 3 carbon atoms. In an example, a xylene solution of impure sodium alkyl salicylates (C14-18 mono- and dialkyl salicylates) is prepared by reacting a xylene solution of the corresponding alkyl phenates with CO2 under pressure; the solution is acidified with H2SO4, separated and methanol added to the xylene solution, followed by settling and filtering; the filtrate is mixed with a Ca(OH)2/xylene slurry and a centrifuge sludge from a later stage, more methanol is added and CO2 passed in; the methanol layer is removed and the xylene layer centrifuged, the sludge being recycled as above; the xylene is distilled, spindle oil is added to the residue and the solution is centrifuged and filtered.

The oilinsoluble metal compound is preferably formed in situ by reacting the oil solution of the organic acid after removal of suspended solids with excess metal base and then treating the reaction mixture with an acidic compound such as CO2. The basic oil-soluble metal salt may be isolated from the oil solution, e.g. by distilling the oil, and may then be dissolved in a different oil. The neutral water-miscible oxygen-containing organic solvent preferably boils below about 140 DEG C. It is preferably miscible with water in all proportions although solvents miscible with up to about 10% or at least 50% by volume of water are mentioned. Preferably aliphatic alcohols, glycols or ketones containing not more than 6 carbon atoms are used such as methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol or acetone, but others such as ethers, e.g. diisopropyl ether, methyl and ethyl ethers of ethylene glycol, 1,3-dioxane or 1,4-dioxane, and esters, e.g. ethyl lactate may be used. The solvent may contain minor amounts of acidic or basic material. The acid used in the acidification step is preferably inorganic, e.g. sulphuric acid but may be an organic acid containing 3 or less carbon atoms, e.g. propionic or acetic acid. The neutral water-miscible oxygen-containing organic solvent added to the acidified oil solution of the oil-soluble metal salts of the organic acid may be added in amounts of 3-100, preferably 8-20% by weight based on the oil solution, more preferably in a quantity just sufficient to saturate the oil solution with the solvent. The same solvent is preferably present during the reaction with the oil-insoluble metal compound formed in situ, but the first solvent may be separated after the solids have been removed and another or the same solvent added later. In any case a further quantity of the same or a different solvent may be added before the final step. Preferably, a further quantity of the same solvent is added after the oil solution of the organic acid has been reacted with a metal base, preferably in an amount such that the total neutral water-miscible oxygen-containing organic solvent present when the oil-soluble salt of the organic acid is reacted with the oil-insoluble metal compound formed in situ is 3-100%, preferably about 30-50% by weight based on the oil solution of the oil-soluble salt of the organic acid. Preferably, a minor amount, more preferably 5-10% by weight of water, is also present during this stage. The term ""oil"" is used to mean a neutral liquid which is not miscible with water such as liquid hydrocarbons, e.g. benzene, toluene, xylene, pentane, heptane and petroleum fractions from gasoline up to lubricating oils. If a suitable oil is used in the reaction, the product may be added directly to a lubricating oil. The products after removal of the oil used during the reaction may be incorporated in synthetic lubricants such as polymerized olefins, alkylated aromatic hydrocarbons, polysiloxanes, fluorocarbons or esters or fatty oils.

The basic salts prepared in the invention may contain ammonium, monovalent metals such as sodium, potassium, or lithium, or polyvalent metals such as the alkaline earth metals (especially calcium and barium), magnesium, zinc, lead, aluminium, copper, tin, cobalt, nickel and manganese. The oil-insoluble metal compound formed in situ is preferably a carbonate, but may be, for example, a sulphide, sulphite or salt of an organic acid containing not more than 3 carbon atoms. Generally, temperatures of 20-150 DEG C. and pressures of atmospheric or higher are used. After the reaction, the reaction mixture may be freed from water and/or the water-miscible oxygen-containing organic solvent, e.g. by heating to 135-160 DEG C. and may be air-blown. The products may be used as lubricant additives or for the preparation of biocides or paint dryers or catalysts. In an example, a xylene solution of impure sodium alkyl salicylates (C14-18 mono and dialkyl salicylates) is prepared by reacting a xylene solution of the corresponding alkyl phenates with CO2 under pressure; the solution is acidified with H2SO4 separated and methanol added to the xylene solution followed by settling and filtering; the filtrate is mixed with a Ca(OH)2/xylene slurry and a centrifuge sludge from a later stage, more methanol is added and CO2 passed in; the methanol layer is removed and the xylene layer centrifuged, the sludge being recycled as above; the xylene is distilled, spindle oil is added to the residue and the solution is centrifuged and filtered.

This ""intramedullary"" stimulation ""jams"" or otherwise prevents the pain signal from being transmitted. The placement of the electrodes is accomplished through an open surgical procedure in which the dura is opened to allow the surgeon direct access to the spinal cord. In the case of SCI (or disease), the electrodes are positioned in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord within several dermatomal segments of the lesion site. Stimulation with intramedullary electrodes can be used to treat other types of pain where stable stimulation of the dorsal columns (and the analogous structures for the face), or their nuclear counterparts (nucleus cuneatus, nucleus gracilis, nucleus caudalis) should relieve pain. Stimulation of the spinothalamic tract may also be achieved by intramedullary placement of electrodes.

Electronic music generator. CHICAGO MUSICAL INSTRUMENT CO. 4 Dec., 1967, No. 55124/67. Heading G5J. [Also in Division H3] In an electronic music generation system, a square wave of frequency f from a source 11, is inverted at 12, and combined in an adder 13, with a sawtooth wave of equal frequency from a synchronized source 10, to give a sawtooth output wave of frequency 2f. In a frequency doubler embodiment (Fig. 3, not shown) equal frequency square waves (11<SP>1</SP>) and sawtooth waves (10<SP>1</SP>) drive tone colour filters (24, 26, respectively) and in addition the square wave is inverted in a unity gain transistorized inverter (12), its peak amplitude halved in an adder (13) and combined with the sawtooth wave (10<SP>1</SP>) to give a sawtooth output wave of frequency 2f, driving a tone colour filter (25). In an octave coupler embodiment (Fig. 4, not shown), the adder (13) includes a switch (43) to open circuit the inverter, and resistors (28, 30) selected to give a mixture of sawtooth waveforms (13<SP>1</SP>, frequency 2f, 10<SP>1</SP>, frequency f). The gain of the inverter circuit (12a, Fig. 5, not shown) may be controlled by a complex signal at an input (51) and the variable gain inverter connected to the square wave source (Fig. 6, not shown) or a variable control comprising a variable voltage controlled amplifier (74, Fig. 7, not shown) may be coupled to the sawtooth generator.",CHICAGO MUSICAL INSTR CO,CAMPBELL DONALD JAMES,,https://lens.org/147-713-562-612-908,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G10H5/07;;H03K6/00,G10H5/07;;H03K6/00,G5J JEGH          EGH;;G5J J1T1          -;;G5J J1T2          -;;G5J J2F2          -;;G5J J3VX          -;;H3T TLV           TLV(;;H3T T1L1          -;;H3T T1P5          -;;H3T T2F1          -;;H3T T2F5          -;;H3T T2T3J         -;;H3T T3V           TLV(,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Drilling machine details. BEVERLEY TOOL & ENGINEERING CO. Ltd. Dec. 7, 1964 [Oct. 28, 1963], No. 42436/63. Heading B3C. A hole 5 is drilled through a sheet of glass 1 by rotating a drill (3), Figs. 3, 4 (not shown), to form an annulus (4), retracting the drill, and then drilling from the other side of the glass, by a second drill (2); the tool (3) being automatically operated when rotation of tool (2) commences. Drills (2) and (3) are carried in quills (17), (20), rotated by electric motors (19), (23), and the glass (1) is clamped on a table,(13) by a clamp (12). A cam (29) is rotated by an electric motor (31), and reciprocates a rod (27) connected to a horizontal arm (25), so that quill (20) along with tool (3) is moved vertically. Cutting fluid is supplied to the drills by cowls (6), (7) and is drained away at (22) for recirculation. Motor (19) is started by closing switch (38), which also starts motors (23), (31). Drill (3) is rotated and is raised by cam (29) to form annulus (4). The drill is retracted when cam portion (42) bears on the top of follower (28), Fig. 6 (not shown), and the cam actuates a micro-switch to switch off motors (23), (31). Drill (2) is now moved into the work to complete hole (5) by a handle (18). Clamp (12) is operated and the supply of water to cowls (6), (7) is provided, by operating a foot pedal. Rod (27) is connected to arm (25) by a nut (44) screwed on to the rod, a spring (45) seated in a bore (43) in the lever, a sleeve (46) screwed on to the nut, and a closed end sleeve (47) screwed to the rod. If the worn drill is not drilling, upward movement of rod (27) compresses spring (45) instead of actuating arm (25), and sleeve (46) moves upwardly to actuate a micro-switch to stop motors (23), (31). Sleeve (47) is adjustable, and abuts a stop to vary the depth of cut.",BEVERLEY TOOL AND ENGINEERING,CAMPBELL ARCHIBALD JAMES,,https://lens.org/013-453-005-326-944,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,B28D1/041,B28D1/04,B3B B29B          -;;B3C C1A16A        -;;B3C C1A17G        -;;B3C C1A4A         -;;B3C C1B8A         -;;B3C C1B8J         -;;B3C C1B8R         -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Two opposed rectilinear rigid members extend transversely to a flexible deformable resilient sleeve and on opposite sides of the sleeve; the flow of fluid to be controlled is through the sleeve from one end to the other. A floating piston is provided in a container, i.e. in a cylinder, which container or cylinder also has a floating mounting and suspension. The piston rod is rigidly connected to one of the rigid members, and the floating container is rigidly connected to the other rigid member. The two rigid members and the container with integral piston all have, as a feature of the invention, a floating mounting and suspension on a frame on which the sleeve is mounted, so that these elements are freely displaceable relative to the frame and towards or away from the sleeve. When a fluid is passed into the container between its outer closed end and the piston head, the closed end, and for that matter the entire container, and the piston head, are both concomitantly displaceable in opposite directions away from each other, so that both rigid members are concomitantly displaceable towards each other in a convergence which pinches the sleeve and curtails or terminates fluid flow through the sleeve.

Electrons musical instruments. CHICAGO MUSICAL INSTRUMENT CO. 4 Dec., 1967, No. 55126/67. Heading G5J. [Also in Division H3] In an electronic music generation system, Fig. 1, signals from single note generators 22, 22a &c., are modified, by sawtooth waves derived from wave shapers 25, driven by a multiphase oscillator 21, to produce percussion and reiteration effects. The modified signals drive tone colour filters 24, are combined on an output line 12 with other signals from conventional sources 11, are amplified at 13 and drive loud-speaker 14. In one embodiment (Fig. 2, not shown), the oscillator (21) is a multivibrator producing a rectangular output in each of two tone generator channels (# 1 , # 2 ), each channel including a wave shaper (25a, 25b) producing sawtooth waves of opposite phase at its terminals, each sawtooth, via an amplitude control circuit 23, determining the amplitude envelope of a signal from a source in the generator channel. These signals are combined in desired phase relationships to give percussion, reiteration, tone colour vibrato and speaking effects. The multivibrator may be free running, keyed by an audio signal at an input (38) or by grounding an alternative input (44), or one shot, keyed at input (38), and the multivibrator frequency may be varied by resistors (45, 46, Fig. 2, not shown). In another embodiment (Fig. 4, not shown) outputs (# 1 , # 2 ) of multivibrator (21) couple, via switches (73, 71) the outputs of tone sources (64, 66) to an amplitude control (23) and at the same time the (# 1 and # 2 ) outputs are coupled by selector switches (68, 70) to a wave shaper (25c). The opposite phase sawtooth outputs at the wave shaper terminals are selectively coupled by a switch (75) to the amplitude control circuit to produce the desired amplitude envelope for the tone signals passed by switches (73, 71) and the amplitude control circuit output drives a single tone colour circuit 24. In a third embodiment (Fig. 5, not shown) an amplitude controlled signal from a single source (83) is selectively applied to tone colour filters (24a, 24b) by switches (81, 82) controlled by the multivibrator (21).",CHICAGO MUSICAL INSTR CO,CAMPBELL DONALD JAMES,,https://lens.org/082-452-338-293-616,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,G10H1/26;;G10H1/26;;G10H1/04;;G10H1/04;;G10H2210/201;;G10H2210/201,G10H1/04;;G10H1/26,G5J J1T1          -;;G5J J2A           -;;G5J J3D           -;;G5J J3R           -;;G5J J3VX          -;;G5J J3X           -;;H3P PAJM          PAJM;;H3T TJM           TJM;;H3T T1G1          -;;H3T T1L1          -;;H3T T1M1          -;;H3T T2A1N         -;;H3T T2B3          -;;H3T T2E           -;;H3T T2F5          -;;H3T T2J           -;;H3T T2T3J         -;;H3T T2T6G         -;;H3T T3A           -;;H3T T3F1          -;;H3T T3K           -;;H3T T3V           TJM;;H3T T3VX          -;;H3T T3X           -;;H3T T4C           -;;H3T T4E1N         -;;H3T T4M           -;;H3T T4P           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The device involves providing two concentric planes, one created by the rotation of a main shaft, at its projection point of intersection with the applicator head, and the second the plane created by the exposed surface of the applicator head. The offset of these planes is adjustable with seventeen degrees being found to be ideal. The applicator head pivots throughout a complete 360 degrees of slow rotation without any turning torque being generated due to the placement of a ball bearing at its point of connection. These applicator heads, which are exchangeable, based on desired size, shape or consistency, are constructed of a flexible material such as rubber, latex, plastic or fabric and form a flexible envelope. Small pellets, or some other suitable material, are loosely enclosed in the applicator head and provide a contour conforming quality to the head. The massage device generates direct circularly rotating pressure without risking inflicting lateral trauma to the tissue of the patient. The device is envisioned to be primarily used from a stationary support stand where the point of contact with the patient, and the amount of pressure applied, can be controlled and uniformly maintained.

Sympathetically maintained pain is diagnosed and treated using the method of injecting or transdermally applying an alpha -adrenergic blocking agent selected from the group consisting of alpha -adrenergic antagonist, alpha -1-adrenergic antagonist, alpha 2 adrenergic agonist, or other drug that depletes sympathetic norepineprhine. Sympathetic efferent fibers release norepinephrine which in turn activates alpha -adrenergic receptors. Activation of these receptors, either directly or indirectly, excites nociceptors.

Targeted nociceptors (pain fibers) must be functionally expressed in the skin in order for clonidine to have a therapeutic effect. Neuropathies associated with pain differ with respect to the expression of nociceptors in the skin. Clonidine targets alpha-2 adrenergic receptors on the terminals of nociceptors. The presence of the targeted nociceptors may be determined by topical application of a TRPV1 agonist such as capsaicin. Patients who detect the capsaicin as a pain stimulus applied near the painful area have expression in the skin of the requisite targeted nociceptors and the targeted alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. The test is referred to as a capsaicin challenge test.

Targeted nociceptors (pain fibers) must be functionally expressed in the skin in order for clonidine to have a therapeutic effect. Neuropathies associated with pain differ with respect to the expression of nociceptors in the skin. Clonidine targets alpha-2 adrenergic receptors on the terminals of nociceptors. The presence of the targeted nociceptors may be determined by topical application of a TRPV1 agonist such as capsaicin. Patients who detect the capsaicin as a pain stimulus applied near the painful area have expression in the skin of the requisite targeted nociceptors and the targeted alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. The test is referred to as a capsaicin challenge test. This test significantly improves clinical outcomes in topical neuropathic pain treatment.,CAMPBELL JAMES N;;ARCION THERAPEUTICS INC,CAMPBELL JAMES N,ARCION THERAPEUTICS INC (2011-07-28),https://lens.org/114-837-039-975-912,Patent Application,yes,0,4,5,5,0,A61K31/165;;A61K31/165;;A61K9/0014;;A61K9/0014;;A61K9/08;;A61K9/08;;A61K31/357;;A61K31/357;;A61K31/4168;;A61K31/4168;;A61K47/32;;A61K47/32;;A61P25/02;;A61P29/00,A61K31/54;;A61K31/4168;;A61K31/4178;;A61K31/506;;A61P25/02;;A61P29/00,514/227.2;;514/256;;514/398;;514/397,2,2,051-062-494-902-462;;031-831-976-179-500,10.1126/science.288.5464.306;;10764638;;10.1001/archneur.55.12.1513;;9865794,"Caterina et al., Science 2000, 288, pages 306-313;;McArthur et al., Arch Neurol, 1998, 1513-1520",DISCONTINUED

Sympathetic efferent fibers release norepinephrine which in turn activates alpha -adrenergic receptors. Activation of these receptors, either directly or indirectly, excites nociceptors. Activity in the nociceptors then evokes pain, and causes further discharge of nociceptors. Intravenous administration of phentolamine blocks the activation of alpha -adrenergic receptors which causes the pain to be relieved.

Electrodes are placed directly into the dorsal horn, dorsal column, spinothalamic tract, nucleus cuneatus, nucleus gracilis, spinal tract of V, or spinal nucleus of V (nucleus caudalis) depending on the source of pain. This 'intramedullary' stimulation 'jams' or otherwise prevents the pain signal from being transmitted. The placement of the electrodes is accomplished through an open surgical procedure in which the dura is opened to allow the surgeon direct access to the spinal cord. In the case of SCI (or disease), the electrodes are positioned in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord within several dermatomal segments of the lesion site. Stimulation with intramedullary electrodes can be used to treat other types of pain where stable stimulation of the dorsal columns (and the analogous structures for the face), or their nuclear counterparts (nucleus cuneatus, nucleus gracilis, nucleus caudalis) should relieve pain. Stimulation of the spinothalamic tract may also be achieved by intramedullary placement of electrodes. The method provides a means to stimulate the targeted area directly, creating a stable means of stimulating the desired area, and decreasing stimulation of other structures.",CAMPBELL JAMES N,CAMPBELL JAMES N,,https://lens.org/021-529-486-781-646,Patent Application,yes,4,6,5,5,0,A61N1/36071;;A61N1/36071;;A61N1/0551;;A61N1/0551,A61N1/05;;A61N1/18;;A61N1/34,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Sympathetically maintained pain is diagnosed and treated using the method of injecting or transdermally applying an alpha -adrenergic blocking agent selected from the group consisting of alpha -adrenergic antagonist, alpha -1-adrenergic antagonist, alpha 2 adrenergic agonist, or other drug that depletes sympathetic norepineprhine. Sympathetic efferent fibers release norepinephrine which in turn activates alpha -adrenergic receptors. Activation of these receptors, either directly or indirectly, excites nociceptors. Activity in the nociceptors then evokes pain, and causes further discharge of nociceptors. Intravenous administration of phentolamine blocks the activation of alpha -adrenergic receptors which causes the pain to be relieved. The use of a clonidine, another alpha -adrenergic blocking agent, in a patch similarly achieved substantive pain reduction.","CAMPBELL, JAMES, N.","CAMPBELL, JAMES, N.","ARC 1, INC.

   A method for manufacturing composite parts includes positioning a plurality of composite layers on an application surface formed by a plurality of tooling members and filler members on a mandrel. A part formation aid is disposed on the composite layers above each tooling member. The filler members are then removed, and the composite layers slit over the recesses. The mandrel, the tooling members, the composite layers, and the part formation aids are placed in a vacuum bag. As the bag is evacuated, each part formation aid forces the side edge of the composite layers formed by the slit around the respective tooling member, thereby forming a composite part with a desired shape, thickness, and density. In an alternate embodiment, a flanged composite panel is formed around a rectangular mandrel after positioning composite layers on an outer surface of the mandrel and an outer surface of a filler member disposed on one end of the mandrel. After removing the filler member, the flanged panel is formed and partially cured by vacuum bagging. A plurality of tooling members and filler members are then placed on the flanged panel to form an application surface. Composite layers are positioned on the application surface, and then the filler members are removed. Vacuum bagging is used to produce a plurality of stiffeners around the tooling members and directly adjacent to the flanged panel. The stiffeners and flanged panel are co-cured to produce a single and integral part.

Window regulators. ROLLS-ROYCE, Ltd. May 26, 1948, No. 14239. [Class 20(iii)] A lifting mechanism for vehicle windows comprises a lever 11, consisting of two spaced arms 11a, which engages the window 28, e.g. by rollers 29 which engage with a channel member 30 carried by the bottom of the window glass, the lever 11 being pivoted on a pin 12 to which the operating handle 10 is secured. The window is retained in its position of adjustment by a fixed segmental rack 18. arranged co-axially with the pin 12, and disposed between the arms 11a, and by two gear wheels 23 likewise disposed between the arms 11a and having spindles 24 which are guided in arcuate slots 25 in the arms 11a, and in slots 22 in a U-shaped element 21 having a recess 20 to receive the end 19a of an arm 19 which moves with the handle 10. A spring 26 urges both wheels 23 to mesh with one another and with the rack 18, thus locking the arm 11 against movement. When pressure is applied to the handle 10, the element 21 is rocked against the action of the spring 26, to bring one of the wheels 23 out of engagement with the rack 18, and the arm 11 is thus free to operate the window, the weight of which may be counterbalanced, e.g. by a coil spring. In a modification, the U-shaped element 21 is omitted and the arm 19 engages directly with the spindle of the gear wheel 23.",ROLLS ROYCE,CRUM JAMES CAMPBELL,,https://lens.org/015-681-392-465-334,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,E05F11/382;;E05Y2900/55,E05F11/38,E2M MMVA          MMVA;;E2M MV            MMVA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Targeted nociceptors (pain fibers) must be functionally expressed in the skin in order for clonidine to have a therapeutic effect. Neuropathies associated with pain differ with respect to the expression of nociceptors in the skin. Clonidine targets alpha-2 adrenergic receptors on the terminals of nociceptors. The presence of the targeted nociceptors may be determined by topical application of a TRPV1 agonist such as capsaicin. Patients who detect the capsaicin as a pain stimulus applied near the painful area have expression in the skin of the requisite targeted nociceptors and the targeted alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. The test is referred to as a capsaicin challenge test.

The metering valve includes a cylindrical gasket having a transverse bore disposed intermediate the ends. Longitudinal bores between each end of the gasket and the transverse bore define a plurality of flow passageways through the valve. A valving member is rotatably received in the transverse bore. Rotation of the valving member allows various flow passageways to be selected. The valving member is mechanically coupled to a steam flow control knob disposed on the exterior of the steam iron housing. The steam flow control knob is provided with a plurality of detent positions to allow a finite number of flow rates to be selected. A drip tube provided at the discharge of the metering valve prevents the valve member from being in direct communication with the steam generator. This reduces the possibility of mineral deposits forming on the valve member due to spattering resulting from the boiling of water droplets in the steam generator; hence changing the flow rate.

    A system and method having a number of call processors and servers which provide prepaid or debit card calling service to local areas is disclosed. The servers are linked via a wide area network (WAN) or some other communications network. The system maintains a single account record for each debit card customer. Each account record contains information such as an account balance and a rate billing plan for the customer. When a customer makes a prepaid call, a local call processor and server handle the call. The local server obtains the customer's record from another server via the WAN if the record is not already present in a local database. WAN traffic is reduced because most debit card users routinely call from the same local area and, as a result, most of calls from a particular customer are processed by the same local call processor and server.

Electrodes are placed directly into the dorsal horn, dorsal column, spinothalamic tract, nucleus cuneatus, nucleus gracilis, spinal tract of V, or spinal nucleus of V (nucleus caudalis) depending on the source of pain. This “intramedullary” stimulation “jams” or otherwise prevents the pain signal from being transmitted. The placement of the electrodes is accomplished through an open surgical procedure in which the dura is opened to allow the surgeon direct access to the spinal cord. In the case of SCI (or disease), the electrodes are positioned in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord within several dermatomal segments of the lesion site. Stimulation with intramedullary electrodes can be used to treat other types of pain where stable stimulation of the dorsal columns (and the analogous structures for the face), or their nuclear counterparts (nucleus cuneatus, nucleus gracilis, nucleus caudalis) should relieve pain. Stimulation of the spinothalamic tract may also be achieved by intramedullary placement of electrodes. The method provides a means to stimulate the targeted area directly, creating a stable means of stimulating the desired area, and decreasing stimulation of other structures.",CAMPBELL JAMES N.,CAMPBELL JAMES N,ARC1 INC (2006-05-10),https://lens.org/018-973-716-576-887,Patent Application,yes,6,39,5,5,0,A61N1/36071;;A61N1/36071;;A61N1/0551;;A61N1/0551,A61N1/05;;A61N1/18;;A61N1/34,607/46,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The metering valve includes a cylindrical gasket having a transverse bore disposed intermediate the ends. Longitudinal bores between each end of the gasket and the transverse bore define a plurality of flow passageways through the valve. A valving member is rotatably received in the transverse bore. Rotation of the valving member allows various flow passageways to be selected. The valving member is mechanically coupled to a steam flow control knob disposed on the exterior of the steam iron housing. The steam flow control knob is provided with a plurality of detent positions to allow a finite number of flow rates to be selected. A drip tube provided at the discharge of the metering valve prevents the valve member from being in direct communication with the steam generator. This reduces the possibility of mineral deposits forming on the valve member due to spattering resulting from the boiling of water droplets in the steam generator; hence changing the flow rate. The drip tube is provided with longitudinal bores of smaller diameter than the gasket that determine the flow rate through the valve.",SUNBEAM CORP,CAMPBELL JAMES D,SUNBEAM CORPORATION A CORP.

SCOTTISH MACHINE TOOL CORPORATION Ltd. July 12, 1957 [April 12, 1956], No. 11140/56. Class 83 (4). A machine for bending bars comprises a headstock, a pair of pivotally connected clamping jaws, and links operatively connecting the jaws to the ram of an hydraulic press whereby the advance of the ram towards the headstock closes the jaws upon a bar or bars disposed between the jaws and the return of the ram effects the opening of the jaws, a subsidiary ram being mounted in the headstock to be movable to and from the jaws to be engageable with the bar or bars held by the jaws. A pair of flanged sections 15 to be bent are placed back to back in the machine to bear against supporting claws 8 on headstock 1. Jaws 2 swingable about a pin 11, on a carriage 11A slidable towards the headstock 1, are connected by pivoted links 4 to a ram 6 of an hydraulic cylinder 7 and, as the ram 6 is advanced, close towards the sections 15 and engage their outer flanges. Continued advance of the ram 6 then moves the jaws 2 forward to bend forward the flanges adjacent these parts of the sections 15 which will form the actual bend until a nose pad 9B on a screw 9 mounted in the pin 11 engages the sections 15. Further forward movement of the ram 6 then bends the sections 15 in co-operation with the claws 8. The screw 9 is adjustable in the pin 11 to determine the amount the flanges are bent over by the jaws 2, by gearing 9A driven by a motor 10. If the flanges of the sections are overbent by the jaws 2 a subsidiary ram 12 is advanced in the headstock 1, by gearing 13A driven by a motor 14, so that a V tool 12B, Fig. 3, carried thereby forces the flanges back. To form bent-back flanges nosepieces 2B, Fig. 3, are fitted to the jaws 2 which bend the flanges back in co-operation with the V tool 12B. To form splayed unflanged sections, sections 17, Fig. 4, are first bent by the ram 6 and then a wedge tool 12C on the ram 12 is moved towards the bent sections to splay their edge portions. If a flange on a section is to be bent relative to the web of the section without the section being bent as a whole a pad 12A on the ram 12 is first moved into contact with the section and the jaws 2 then bend the flange thereagainst.

The forming means includes means for causing said relative movement constituted by drive means which is adjustable to permit forming means of different sizes to be utilized. The movement of the forming means permits successive layers or laminae of the strip to be welded to each other in circular form until a seal of the desired dimension is achieved. The method of the invention involves the step of simultaneously welding a plurality of male and female nodes which are juxtaposed to each other, and the additional step of welding pairs of nodes which are interspersed between previously welded pairs and the further step of utilizing the welding of a selected pair of nodes as a signal for the simultaneous weldment of additional pairs.",CAMBERN LTD,CAMPBELL JAMES R,,https://lens.org/100-884-498-120-36X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,18,18,0,B23K11/0093;;B23K11/0093,B23K11/00,26-161,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Sympathetic efferent fibers release norepinephrine which in turn activates alpha -adrenergic receptors. Activation of these receptors, either directly or indirectly, excites nociceptors. Activity in the nociceptors then evokes pain, and causes further discharge of nociceptors. Intravenous administration of phentolamine blocks the activation of alpha -adrenergic receptors which causes the pain to be relieved.

Working-fluid supply; regulating.-Relates to means for reducing the temperature of superheated or high-temperature steam on its way to a turbine or reciprocating engine, and is specially applicable to astern turbines, which are liable to damage on the sudden admission of hightemperature steam. Cooling water by-passed from the feed or boiler water is injected into the steam in its passage from the stop-valve B, Fig. 2, to the turbine, the water being conducted to an atomizing rose past a valve C for regulating the quantity and a valve D for regulating the admission, while valve D is inter-connected with the steam valve B by operative gearing so that both valves are opened simultaneously, or the water valve slightly in advance of the steam valve. The gearing may be arranged so that, while steam can never be initially admitted without water also being admitted, the water valve may be subsequently closed independently of the steam valve, and further so that when the steam valve is closed the mechanism i n t e r - connecting the valves comes into engagement again, enabling both steam and water valves to open together when next required. The gearing may comprise an axially moving shaft F arranged between the valve spindles and carrying at one end a screwthread on which is mounted a bevel wheel carried in a fixed bearing and meshing with a similar wheel on the spindle controlling the water valve D. The other end of the shaft slides on a feather in a hollow shaft on which is fixed another bevel wheel meshing with a similar wheel controlling the steam valve B. Adjacent to the shaft is a stop H adapted to be manually moved into or out of engagement with an abutment on the shaft, whereby endlong movement of the shaft is prevented or permitted, according to whether both valves are to be operated simultaneously or independently. Other forms of operative mechanism connecting the valves are described. Fig. 3, for example, shows a construction wherein both bevel gears are fast on the shaft F, and the spindle of the valve D is provided with a screw-threaded portion engaging a rectilinearly guided cup J, which is under the influence of a spring tending to close the valve, the cup being restrained from such movement by a catch K controlled by a hand-lever.",CAMPBELL JAMES ALLAN,CAMPBELL JAMES ALLAN,,https://lens.org/012-881-823-912-747,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,F01D17/00,F01D17/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Sympathetically maintained pain is diagnosed and treated using the method of injecting or transdermally applying an alpha -adrenergic blocking agent selected from the group consisting of alpha -adrenergic antagonist, alpha -1-adrenergic antagonist, alpha 2 adrenergic agonist, or other drug that depletes sympathetic norepineprhine. Sympathetic efferent fibers release norepinephrine which in turn activates alpha -adrenergic receptors. Activation of these receptors, either directly or indirectly, excites nociceptors. Activity in the nociceptors then evokes pain, and causes further discharge of nociceptors. Intravenous administration of phentolamine blocks the activation of alpha -adrenergic receptors which causes the pain to be relieved. The use of a clonidine, another alpha -adrenergic blocking agent, in a patch similarly achieved substantive pain reduction.",ARC 1 INC,CAMPBELL JAMES N,"ARCION THERAPEUTICS, INC. (N.D.GES. D.

Molten metal is discharged from a container 1 to a nozzle 21 by pressure gas introduced below the level of the liquid from a conduit 23. The gas is supplied at two alternative pressures such that one pressure maintains a ready to pour column having an upper level 29 and the other pressure raises the level to pour level 27 so that liquid is discharged over the lip 17. The pressures are controlled by valves 45, 47 and selected by a solenoid actuated valve 51. The gas may be nitrogen or argon. The actuating gas is also introduced above the liquid levels in the end of the conduit 15 by means of a conduit 57 having a control valve 59; pressure is controlled by a pressure switch 61 which opens a vent valve 65. At the end of a pour the level of liquid is quickly brought to the level 29 by introducing pressure above the liquid level in conduit 15 by closing valve 65 and opening valve 73. The pour cycle may be controlled by a time switch 93. Bubbling of the gas through the molten metal serves to purify it and the inert gas prevents oxidation.",CAMPBELL JAMES S,CAMPBELL JAMES SAMUEL,,https://lens.org/015-639-902-436-13X,Granted Patent,no,0,1,10,10,0,B67D7/36;;B67D7/36;;B22D17/30;;B22D17/30;;B22D39/00;;B22D39/00;;B22D39/06;;B22D39/06;;C21C7/10;;C21C7/10,B22D17/30;;B22D39/00;;B22D39/06;;B67D7/36;;C21C7/10,F1R R3A3A         R3A3A;;F1R R9E           R3A3A,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

W., and Campbell, L. M. March 13, 1916. Grouped machines; feed by clamps; presser-bars, lifting.-In embroidery sewing-machines of the kind having fixed needle-bars and vibrating or reciprocating work-holders, means are provided for raising the presser-feet during the movement of the work-holders. The invention is described as applied to a number of machines for simultaneously producing a number of duplicates from one pattern with work-holders turnably mounted in a frame which is capable of longitudinal and lateral movements. The presser-foot of each machine is connected by a cord v<2> with one end v<1> of a lever mounted on a common shaft, the other end v<3> of the lever being operated by a cam v<4> on the common driving-shaft e' of the machines. The work-holders b are carried by a longitudinally and laterally movable frame a and are turnable simultaneously by a chain engaging their toothed peripheries. The frame a is supported on sliding members f and is reciprocated longitudinally by the engagement with racks f<1> thereon of pinions g<1> on a shaft g, which can be turned by hand through the wheel g<2> for adjustment, or automatically through an arm p supported on the shaft g and adapted to be connected or disconnected from a disk q on the shaft. The arm p is connected by a link o with one end of a lever pivoted on a movable fulcrum l, the other end being hinged to the free end of an arm k pivoted to a fixed support k<2>, and intermediate its ends to a rod i which is reciprocated in guides by a cam h on the main shaft d. The fulcrum e is movable in a slot m<1> in a support m for varying the throw of the levers j, p as desired, and is under the control of the operator through the knee-lever n, cord n', and a weight. The transverse feed of the frame is obtained by turning the threaded shaft w<1> either manually by the wheel w or through gearing from the main shaft d.

    A method for manufacturing composite parts includes positioning a plurality of composite layers on an application surface formed by a plurality of tooling members and filler members on a mandrel. A part formation aid is disposed on the composite layers above each tooling member. The filler members are then removed, and the composite layers slit over the recesses. The mandrel, the tooling members, the composite layers, and the part formation aids are placed in a vacuum bag. As the bag is evacuated, each part formation aid forces the side edge of the composite layers formed by the slit around the respective tooling member, thereby forming a composite part with a desired shape, thickness, and density. In an alternate embodiment, a flanged composite panel is formed around a rectangular mandrel after positioning composite layers on an outer surface of the mandrel and an outer surface of a filler member disposed on one end of the mandrel. After removing the filler member, the flanged panel is formed and partially cured by vacuum bagging. A plurality of tooling members and filler members are then placed on the flanged panel to form an application surface. Composite layers are positioned on the application surface, and then the filler members are removed. Vacuum bagging is used to produce a plurality of stiffeners around the tooling members and directly adjacent to the flanged panel. The stiffeners and flanged panel are co-cured to produce a single and integral part.

The fatty acid can be used in a lure or other propagator to provide a dispersion of fatty acid in the air, the variation in the concentration of the fatty acid in the air being such that a whitefly is attracted to the lure as the source of the fatty acid. In particular, it has been found that the use of a fatty acid as an attractant results in significantly higher levels of attraction, as measured by the number of whiteflies attracted to a sticky trap, as compared to the use of colour alone.

The fatty acid can be used in a lure or other propagator to provide a dispersion of fatty acid in the air, the variation in the concentration of the fatty acid in the air being such that a whitefly is attracted to the lure as the source of the fatty acid. In particular, it has been found that the use of a fatty acid as an attractant results in significantly higher levels of attraction, as measured by the number of whiteflies attracted to a sticky trap, as compared to the use of colour alone. A further application of the discovery that fatty acids are whitefly pheromones is in a method of killing the whitefly.

    A method for manufacturing composite parts includes positioning a plurality of composite layers on an application surface formed by a plurality of tooling members and filler members on a mandrel. A part formation aid is disposed on the composite layers above each tooling member. The filler members are then removed, and the composite layers slit over the recesses. The mandrel, the tooling members, the composite layers, and the part formation aids are placed in a vacuum bag. As the bag is evacuated, each part formation aid forces the side edge of the composite layers formed by the slit around the respective tooling member, thereby forming a composite part with a desired shape, thickness, and density. In an alternate embodiment, a flanged composite panel is formed around a rectangular mandrel after positioning composite layers on an outer surface of the mandrel and an outer surface of a filler member disposed on one end of the mandrel. After removing the filler member, the flanged panel is formed and partially cured by vacuum bagging. A plurality of tooling members and filler members are then placed on the flanged panel to form an application surface. Composite layers are positioned on the application surface, and then the filler members are removed. Vacuum bagging is used to produce a plurality of stiffeners around the tooling members and directly adjacent to the flanged panel. The stiffeners and flanged panel are co-cured to produce a single and integral part.

   A capacitive touch detector comprises means to improve selectivitya narrow band buffer. Means for reducing the effect of noise comprise capacitive coupling of the buffer into the detector, which comprises a plurality of sensor pads of different inherent capacitances and means to approximate impedances which include said capacitances and are adapted to operate at respective frequencies to approximate the impedances. At least two multiplexers are arranged in series to lower capacitance loading of the sensor pads. A synchronous demodulator is arranged to be connected as a tracking filter to track the frequency of a capacitance-measuring signal from one to another of the sensor pads, possibly during a scan thereof. 

   A controller is connected to a number of pads or capacitive sensing zones by way of buffered multiplexer chips and, shielded connectors and cables. The buffered multiplexer chips can be cascaded in series or wired in parallel and are driven from a level translator which can in its simplest form comprise a resistor and capacitor network but should preferably comprise active elements. This ensures that the base voltage on (the voltage first applied in a halfwave to) a sensor pad is also applied to its shield and various parts (e.g. power supply rails, control port, chip substrate) of its associated multiplexer/s. The signals derived from this electronic scanning array are then further processed by a signal processor incorporating a microprocessor. The improvements relate to obtaining and processing the signal both in the analogue and digital domains and allow more reliable touch detection, including interpolation methods.
