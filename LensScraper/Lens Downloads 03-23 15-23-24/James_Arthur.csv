A first device uses a first short range wireless capability to detect an identifier transmitted from a second device in proximity, ideally using existing radio capabilities such as Bluetooth (IEEE802.15.1-2002) or Wi-Fi (IEEE802.11).

HOBBS MANUFACTURING CO. March 7, 1961, No. 8278/61. Class 80 (2). [Also in Groups IX, XVI and XXXIV] A variable-speed gear for use with wire, paper &c. winding and unwinding apparatus comprises a driving shaft 17 fast on which is a carrier supporting a bevel planet pinion 20 meshing a reaction side gear 23 driving through a train 22, 27 to a pump 26 which forces liquid through an adjustable orifice 69, and also meshing a side gear 25 driving through a train 24, 31 to a driven shaft 29. A simple reverse gear 39, 45, 44; 36, 46 between the driven shaft 29 and a layshaft 42 is manually controlled by means of a knob 52 and links &c. sliding a positive clutch collar 32 on the layshaft to rotate the latter always in the same direction, independently of reversal of the direction of rotation of the driving shaft 17 for winding and unwinding operations. The layshaft 42 drives through a train 46, 63 to the side gear 62 of a second differential having its planet pinion 61 driven by an electric motor 59, the second side gear 64 of this differential driving an auxiliary pump 67 supplying liquid through a pipe 73 to a cylinder 68 containing a free floating piston 70. The pump 26 supplies liquid through a pipe 28 to the opposite side of the free floating piston 70 from a sump 14, whence it returns through the orifice 69, partially closed by the piston. When the driving shaft 17 is rotated in one direction for winding, decreasing speed of the driven shaft 29 causes the pump 26 to supply more liquid to the cylinder 68 and thereby tend to slide the piston 70 rightwards of Fig. 2, this action being opposed by the change in speed of rotation of the auxiliary pump 67 which works harder and supplies a higher pressure to the opposite side of the piston, so that the latter remains in the same position and maintains a constant size of the orifice 69, whereby the material is wound at a constant tension. When the driving shaft 17 is rotated in the opposite direction for unwinding, and following change-over of the reverse gear 32 &c., increasing speed of the driven shaft 29 causes the auxiliary pump 67 to slow down, thus allowing the free floating piston 70 to move to the right of Fig. 2 and increase the size of the orifice 69 through which the pump 26 is forcing liquid, reducing the torque applied to the driven shaft. The tension in the wound material can be adjusted by a needle valve 75 through which liquid supplied from the auxiliary pump 67 returns to the sump 14. The electric motor 59 may have its speed of rotation controlled by the operations of the main process machine containing the gear, to vary the speed of rotation of the driven shaft 29. The sump 14 is formed in the upper part of a casing 10 containing the gearing.",HOBBS MFG COMPANY,THOMSON ARTHUR JAMES,,https://lens.org/003-329-914-837-185,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,B65H23/1955;;F16H61/0262;;F16H2718/24,B65H23/195;;F16H61/02,F2D DA001         DA-M;;F2D DA005         DA-M;;F2D DA009         DA-M;;F2D DA023         DA-M;;F2D DA164         DA-M;;F2D DB026         DA-M;;F2D DB040         DA-M;;F2D DCG           DA-M;;F2D DE18          DED;;F2D DE28          DED;;F2D DE31          DED;;F2D DE34          DED;;F2D DE4           DED;;F2D DE43          DED;;F2D DE56          DED;;F2F FA            FA50X;;F2F FC            FC652/660;;F2F F50X          FA50X;;F2F F652          FC652/660;;F2F F660          FC652/660,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

NATIONAL RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT CORP. 9 Dec., 1966 [20 Dec., 1965], No. 53782/65. Heading H2A. An electrical generator comprises a member of magnetic material arranged for reciprocating motion, an electrical winding arranged to be energized by direct current to produce magnetic flux, the reluctance of the path for which varies with the position of the member, and means for allowing an alternating output current due to an alternating voltage generated in the winding when the above-mentioned reluctance changes, to be taken, without a substantial direct current component, from the generator. As shown, a cylindrical member 1 reciprocates between the positions shown inside a hollow cylindrical casing 2 around which two coils 3, 4 are provided. When coils 3 and 4 are energized by direct current, the path for flux produced by coil 3 includes the member 1 when it is in the extreme position shown, and the path for flux produced by coil 4 includes the member 1 when it is in the opposite extreme position. Thus the magnitudes of the fluxes alternately vary between maximum and minimum values as member 1 reciprocates. This flux variation induces A.C. in windings 3 and 4, and currents without substantial D.C. components can be extracted from the windings by means such as a transformer coupling. The member 1 may be driven by a single cylinder I.C. engine, or the arrangement 1, 2 may itself constitute the I.C. engine. The invention may take the form of a single cylinder, double piston, arrangement (Fig. 2, not shown). While the direct current may be provided from an external source, part of the A.C. output may be rectified and fed back for D.C. excitation. In the latter case, initial induction may be provided by a small bar magnet extending axially of the piston.",NAT RES DEV,ELLISON ARTHUR JAMES,,https://lens.org/004-774-790-526-693,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,H02K35/06,H02K35/06,H2A AQS           QS;;H2A A1A           -;;H2A A1B1Y         -;;H2A A2M           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

[Also in Division H1] A vestigial sideband filter for a television system is connected to a vision-modulated carrier source by a circulator and the vision signal combined with a sound signal in a further circulator. The vision signal is passed by the three-port circulator 1 from source 3 to an output line 5 where unwanted components of the lower sideband are rejected by a filter 6, 7, 8, 9 and reflected back to the circulator which couples them to a dissipative load 13. The line 5 also comprises a filter 15, 16, 17 designed to pass the vision signal and to reflect a sound signal. The latter signal is fed from a source 23 to a circulator 19 which couples it into the line 5. The circulator couples the vision signal and the reflected sound signal to an output 21. The sound-and-vision combining circuit is the same as that described in Specification 1,122,742, and any of the modifications described in that Specification may be used.

When a cop a is placed in the magazine b, it is retained at the entrance by a spring or like catch c, and the free end of weft is doubled and laid between fingers e on a brush d or other material having a pile surface. The brush is adjustably carried upon a spindle d', and the requisite length of weft is drawn from the cop and measured by passing it between the fingers when these are laid upon a plate g. The doubled end of weft is held against the bristles of the brush by a spring-pressed plate f, and is laid across guide-rails b<1>, the free end being wound round a pin, or inserted between a band h on rollers h<1> and a band on a pulley i, which may be turned slightly to grip the weft by means of a central knob.

Loom slop-motions. -In an automatic bobbin - changing loom of the type described in Specification No. 15,867, A.D. 1905, mechanism is provided for stopping the loom if a bobbin is not properly inserted into the shuttle, or if the bobbin magazine is exhausted or the lowest bobbin therein is sticking. A lever h is pivotei to a bracket at the back of the lay a, and has fingers projecting into the shuttle box above and below the shuttle. If the newly-inserted bobbin projects above or below the shuttle, it strikes one of the fingers on the lever h and rotates the latter, whereby, through an arm a<2> and a sliding rod b on the lay, a pivoted bell-crank lever moves the shipper lever from its notch and stops the loom. The rod b is also moved to stop the loom when the transferrer fails to take a fresh bobbin from the magazine. When a bobbin is taken from the magazine, it . depresses a finger pivoted thereto, and, through suitable mechanism, raises a pivoted cam-piece n out of the path of a projection m<1> on a bell-crank lever m, which is pivoted to the actuating-slide k of the transferrer. When the transferrer fails to take a bobbin from the magazine, the projection m' rides up the cam-piece n, and the upper end of a vertical arm of the lever m strikes a finger o, which is pivoted on the lay. When the finger o is moved, it acts through a pivoted lever p to slide the rod b and thereby stop the loom. When the finger pivoted on the magazine is depressed by a bobbin, it is held down by a pin thereon engaging the underside of the transferrer, in order to keep the cam-piece n inoperative until after the slide k has returned to its normal position.",JACKSON ARTHUR JAMES,JACKSON ARTHUR JAMES,,https://lens.org/107-156-668-692-010,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Calculating - apparatus. -In an adding-machine, the ratchet k of the units drum 1 of the registering- drums 1, 2, 3 is actuated by a pawl j carried by an arm i on a pinion h, which is rotated by a toothed quadrant g, operated by the engagement of the hooked ends of the levers s of the finger keys t with bars p mounted on T - ended levers n, n<1>, of which the lever n is an arm of the quadrant lever g. To render the stroke of all the finger keys t equal, the bars p are stepped, and the lower row of levers s, which have to give the longer travel to the quadrant g, engage the bars p at a greater distance from the axis than the upper levers. Thus the depression of a finger key t causes the quadrant g to travel through an arc, the length of which is dependent on the number on the finger key depressed, and the pawl j to travel over a corresponding number of teeth on the ratchetwheel k. On releasing the finger key, the spring v returns the quadrant g to its normal position, thereby moving the pinion h, the lever i, and the pawl j in the reverse direction, turning the ratchet k and the drum l the number of teeth or spaces represented by the number on the key depressed. The hooks on the levers, s prevent the overrunning of the quadrant g, and the overrunning of the drum is prevented by a stop l abutting against a spring detent m, while a spring detent 16 prevents the drum from turning in the backward direction. The carrying over from one drum to the next can be effected in any known manner, or by the mechanism shown in Fig. 5, in which a snail cam 8 on the drum, as it revolves, gradually raises the lever 10 and pawl 15 in opposition to a spring 15<a> until the pin 9, having arrived at the highest point of the cam 8, suddenly drops and causes the ratchet 12 and the drum to move one tooth or division, its further movement being prevented by a stop 10<a>. The return of the indicating-drums to their zero position to enable a fresh addition to be made is effected by a handwheel 5, which is normally locked by a stud 17 and a spring catch 7. After the wheel 5 has been released by pressing the axle d against the spring 6 and by holding back the catch 7, it is turned, causing a lever q to rock the quadrant g and disengage the pawl k, so that the units drum 1 can be moved into the zero line when pins 18 on the drums or snail cams are engaged by pins 19 on the axle d.",POSTANS ARTHUR JAMES,POSTANS ARTHUR JAMES,,https://lens.org/122-256-166-927-504,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

A device for producing phase shift in a transmission line comprises a U-shaped section which is telescopically slidable relative to two parallel ports of the line by a mechanical drive so as to vary the length of the line and a calibrated indicating device, mechanically coupled to said section to indicate the phase shift produced by said variation. Two fixed parallel sections of coaxial line 4 are connected by a U-shaped section 5 which is telescopically slidable relative to the parts 4 in trombone manner. The section 5 is movable by rotation of knob 12 connected to a lead screw 10, which engages a block assembly 9 attached to said section and which is mounted between a bearing plate 11 and a front panel 1. A calibrated drum 13 is located behind said panel but visible through a window therein and rotated by means of a drive cord 16 attached to the assembly 9, when the section 5 is further inserted into section 4, against the action of a spring 17. The ends of the conductors of section 4 adjacent the section 5 are slotted and the inner and outer conductors carry spring clips 7 and 8 respectively ensuring good contact at the junction with section 5. The device is mounted in an insulated manner between the panel 1 and an insulating rear mounting plate 2 which are held in spaced relation by rods 3.

Ordnance; fuze setting devices. ROSE BROS. (GAINSBOROUGH), Ltd. Dec. 7, 1945 Nov. 8, 1944], No. 21977/44. Class 92(2). A fuze-setting device attached to the barrel 11 of a gun comprises two wire gripper units 36 which stretch a wire 81 across the muzzle so that a highvoltage can be applied to the wire for the purpose of manipulating the fuze of a projectile as it leaves the muzzle. The gripper units 36 are rotatably mounted and diametrically arranged on a carrier 21, 21, which is itself rotatable within a casing 16, 17, 14 about a supporting member 11. The carrier 21, 22 is driven intermittently by a continually rotating electric motor 32 through gearing 23, 24, whenever a clutch 29 is engaged. The clutch mechanism is similar to that described in detail in Specification 602,829, [Group XXIV]. When no wire extends between the gripper units to complete an electric circuit, a solenoid 101 is so energized that the clutch 29 engages and the carrier 21, 22 moves through 180 degrees before the clutch is disengaged. Each gripper unit is mounted on a ball race 60 and comprises semi-circular jaws 41, 42 which are caused to grip a wire 81 at the correct times bv the movement of a roller 57 engaging a track 58. The wire is fed from a rotatable reel 82 through a pivoted cover member 86. When the gun is fired the recoil motion actuates a changeover switch to apply a high voltage to the wire 81 and subsequently to restore the low-tension supply to the solenoid. The projectile breaks the wire and the blast forces the free ends against cutters 73. During rotation of the carrier a friction roller 43 engages tracks 76, 77 thereby oscillating the gripper unit approaching the feeder 83 so that it discharges any remaining wire fragment. Insulators 122 prevent flashover.",ROSE BROTHERS LTD,KAY JAMES ARTHUR,,https://lens.org/185-916-974-963-526,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,F42C17/04,F42C17/04,F3C CLX           CLX,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Class 9(i) A shield 1 to position an electric detonator in an explosive charge and to protect it from accidental initiation has an upper body portion 2 and a lower threaded portion 3 of reduced diameter. Formed in the shield is a through passage 4 for a detonator and extending from the passage 4 across the concave top 6 of the shield is a slot 5 continued diagonally across the shield to the lower end of the passage 4. The upper part of the slot is sufficiently wide and deep to accommodate two insulated leading wires, while the lower part of the slot will hold from leading wires without any of the wires projecting beyond the contour of the shield. The shield is screwed into a recessed portion 8 of a primer canister provided with a detonator-receiving tube 9. The opposite end of the canister has an externally threaded projection 10 adapted to engage a recessed threaded portion 11 of a canister 12 containing blasting explosive. Several canisters 12 may be screwed together to form a column of explosive. With larger charges the shield may be screwed into an adapter similar to the recessed part 8, a detonator tube being screwed into the adapter. To use the shield an electric detonator is passed upwards through the hole 4 taking part of the lead wires with it. The wires are then pressed into the slot 5 and their free ends brought upwards along the diagonal part of the slot while the detonator is inserted in the tube 9 and the shield is screwed into the recess 8.

In a dish-washing machine having a washing chamber through or within which washing liquid is caused to circulate continuously the washing liquid is filtered by a main filter through which all or the greater part of the circulating liquid passes and a secondary filter or filters of finer mesh through which only a part of the circulating liquid is permitted or constrained to pass. As illustrated in Fig. 1 the dish-washing machine has a rotary impeller as described in Specification 832,756 for discharging spray on to the dishes to be washed, which are arranged in racks R 1 , R 2 in a cabinet C. The main filter (not shown) consists of a disc of open mesh gauze detachably fitted in the sump S, and the secondary filter F is suspended between a side runner for the rack R 2 and the cabinet wall. The filter F consists of a bag or pouch of fine mesh, e.g. of nylon, attached to a wire frame the upper parallel members 3, 4 of which are more widely spaced than the lower members 5 to provide an open mouth to collect the soiled water running down the cabinet wall. The lower part of the bag is held away from the cabinet wall by a member 7 so that the filtered liquid passes through both walls of the bag. To prevent overspilling caused by foam present in the washing liquid the filter bag may have a narrow throat near its mouth. Alternatively a bimetallic element may be disposed in the mouth of the filter bag which flexes as the temperature of the washing liquid rises during the washing operation to reduce the size of the mouth opening. Overspilling of foam may also be prevented by alternately inclined baffles arranged in the filter bag. In two further constructions the secondary filter is arranged opposite one end of the impeller tube T, and above the main filter in the sump S, respectively.",COLSTON LTD C,ALABASTER ARTHUR JAMES,,https://lens.org/117-124-890-870-451,Granted Patent,no,0,2,6,7,0,A47L15/4202;;A47L15/4202;;A47L15/06;;A47L15/06;;A47L15/16;;A47L15/16;;A47L15/22;;A47L15/22;;A47L15/23;;A47L15/23,A47L15/06;;A47L15/16;;A47L15/22;;A47L15/23;;A47L15/42,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A curved face C, concentric with the pivot A<1>, lies between these stops. A pawl engaging the curved face C permits movement of the lever in one direction only, until at the end of the stroke the stop C<1> rocks the pawl, which is held out of engagement with the face C by a detent, until at the end of the return stroke the stop C' returns the pawl to its operative position. The pawl D shown in Fig. 1 has a point D<2> engaging with the serrated face C. The detent shown is a ball E pressed by a spring into a recess d<1> in the pawl. In a modification, the pawl has a convex face which engages frictionally with the lever. In a second modification, the pawl has two convex faces, so as to form a two-way full-stroke device. In the latter case, no detent is necessary, although the spring is retained to keep the pawl in engagement with the lever.

Norris, A. J. Feb. 9. Handles, door etc.; handles, attaching; escutcheons, keyhole. - Relates to handles, especially such as are used for furniture and the like, which are made in three distinct parts, namely, a handle proper, a bracket or brackets, and a back-plate. The brackets are provided with bases at rightangles to the part in which the handle is swung and are secured to the back-plate by screws or other means. In some cases, the brackets are T-shaped, thus providing bases on both sides of the projecting parts, the bases being imperforate and secured by the clamping action of the backplate ; or the base of the bracket may be discshaped, the projecting part being, if desired, stamped or pressed out of the substance of the disc. When a single bracket is employed, the back-plate may be provided at its upper part with a keyhole slot, so as to form an escutcheon to a keyhole, and, if desired, the base of the bracket may be carried upwards and slotted to form a backing for the keyhole of the base-plate. The back-plate is cut with a single horizontal slot, and the bracket is formed of a strip of metal, bent round the handle to form an eye, and is secured by screws or other means. In the form shown in Fig. 26, the base c<1> of the bracket d is fixed on the front of the back-plate b by a screw e, and part of the base c<1> is stamped to form two spikes or tongues c', which are driven into the article of furniture a. The back-plate may be formed with a vertical slot, through which projects a perforated bracket the base of which is secured to the backplate by a screw, the handle being split and a pin passed through the two ends thereof and through the perforation in the bracket. In the form shown in Fig. 32, the strip of metal forming the bracket c is bent to form a socket, into which is fitted the end of a transversely-perforated latch spindle or the like f. A pin d<2> is passed through the ends of the handle d, the socket in the bracket c, and the perforation in the spindle f. The back-plate b is fixed to the article independently of the bracket c, which may thus turn with the handle and the latch spindle.",NORRIS ARTHUR JAMES,NORRIS ARTHUR JAMES,,https://lens.org/146-899-004-704-869,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Class 68(2) In an expansible mandrel for driving sheet metal tubes into the ground, having a central member 12 and sectors 3 in which pneumatically controlled expansion chambers provide a radial thrust to support the tubes during driving, a separate set of pneumatic chambers is provided for the contraction of the mandrel. Preferably, each chamber is a longitudinally extending rubber pipe, each pipe 19 of one set being in radial alignment with a pipe 18 of the other set. The pipes are closed at their lower ends, and the admission of fluid under pressure to pipes 19 forces the arms 17 and 11 apart, contracts the mandrel, and flattens pipes 18 against their resilient tendency to assume a circular form. On inflating pipes 18, pipes 19 offer no resistance to flattening and the sectors 3 are guided radially outwards by arms 9. Upper casing 6 is attached by bolts 7 which allow for the radial movement of the sectors 3, and is provided with a wooden block 24 to receive hammer blows. These are transmitted to the central member 12 through resilient washer 15.

The method of attachment of a hauling line 1, Fig. 1, to one end of a tube 2, such as an aluminium cable sheath, which comprises placing the shouldered end of a draw-bar 3, the shoulder comprising a nut or collar 5, within that end of the tube 2 and symmetrically deforming the latter round the draw-bar' 3 to form a number of internal shoulders that serve as abutments for the nut 5 when the line 1 is placed under tension and to form a central hole or passage through and beyond which the draw-bar projects, and to reduce the effective diameter of the end of the tube on the hauling line side of the draw-bar; the tube may be deformed by radial crimping at three or more equidistant places to produce a tube shape which when seen in cross-section consists of three or more, preferably four, symmetrically lobes 6, Fig. 2, between which the wall of the tube approaches the axis thereof to the desired extent for defining an aperture for the draw-bar. The tube 2, Fig. 1, is drawn off a drum (not shown) by the line 1 that is attached to the draw-bar 3 by a shackle 10 in such a manner as to provide for relative rotation therebetween. After the tube has been unreeled the deformed end of the tube is removed. Over the bared ends of an electric cable 30, Fig. 4, is placed a metal sleeve 32 which has a serrated internal surface and an axial bar 36 threaded into one end, the bar having a tapered extremity that penetrates and expands the cable end to force it into tight contact with the serrations. The outer portion of the bar 36 is enlarged at 40 to engage a recess 42 in the shackle 10 so that the cable may be drawn through the oversize tube 2 after which the end of the latter is crimped in order that the whole may be drawn through a reducing die, not shown, to force the tube into contact with the cable body, the reduced crimped end facilitating entry into the die. In this operation the front 48 of the shackle 10 takes the place of the nut 5, Fig. 1, and the line 1 acts as the draw-bar.

DAVY & UNITED ENGINEERING CO. Ltd. July 26,1961 [July 26, 1960], No. 25946/60. Heading G1N. The elongation of magnetisable material as it passes through rolling means is determined by magnetising parts of the material at first points on the entry and exit sides of the rolling means, and generating electrical signals as the magnetised parts pass further points on the entry and exit sides, the magnetising taking place simultaneously with the generation of a signal at one of the further points, whereby the time separation of the signals is a measure of the elongation, and of the difference in speeds of the material at either side of the rolling means. Steel strip 5 passes between rollers 6 and passes close to transmitters 12, 12<SP>1</SP>, which magnetise the strip, and receivers 7, 7<SP>1</SP> which generate signals as magnetised parts of the strip pass them. Signals from receiver 7 pass through amplifier 8, pulse shaper 9, triggered pulse generator 10 and power amplifier driving circuit 11 to transmitter 12, so that pulses are generated continuously at a frequency depending on the speed of the strip and the separation of the transmitter and receiver. These pulses are fed through a D. C. restoring circuit 13 and a low-pass filter 14 to an indicator 15 measuring the ingoing strip speed. The system is triggered by a freerunning pulse generator 16 (e.g. at 1 pulse/sec.), below the minimum frequency (e.g. 3 pulses/sec.) of the speed measuring apparatus, generator 16 being biased off by bias amplifier 17 once the apparatus has been started. Generator 10 also operates transmitter 12<SP>1</SP>, and the separation of each transmitter from its corresponding receiver is made the same. The pulses generated by receiver 7<SP>1</SP> are fed through amplifier 8<SP>1</SP> and shaper 9<SP>1</SP> to pulse generator 10<SP>1</SP>, and the outputs from generators 10, 10<SP>1</SP> are fed to a pulse generator 18, which produces pulses whose width is proportional to the time separation of the input pulses. These pulses are applied through a D. C. restoring circuit 19 and filter 20 to an indicator 21 giving a signal proportional to the product of pulse width and pulse frequency, which is substantially proportional to the elongation of the strip, for small elongations. In a modification, suitable for measuring large elongations,transmitter 12 and receiver 7 are placed at the output side of rollers 6 and units 7<SP>1</SP>, 12<SP>1</SP> at the input side so that the frequency of the pulses applied to both transmitters is proportional to the outgoing strip speed, instead of the ingoing speed. A switch 22 is provided for zero-point calibration and checking purposes.",DAVY & UNITED ENG CO LTD,HARRISON JAMES ARTHUR,,https://lens.org/145-121-852-899-239,Granted Patent,no,0,4,1,1,0,G01B7/046,G01B7/04,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Welding by pressure. GENERAL ELECTRIC CO. Ltd. 13 Oct., 1966 [26 Oct., 1965], No. 45351/65. Heading B3R. In fastening together pieces of material the pieces are lapped with apertures in each piece aligned to form a hole through the pieces, a fastener of cold'weldable material is arranged at each end of the hole and the central parts of the fasteners are cold welded through the hole to each other or to opposite sides of a junction piece of cold weldable material within the hole. Each of two sheets 11, 12, Fig. 1, has a portion bent at right angles to form flanges 14 15 in which oval holes 16 are punched, the holes are aligned and V shaped aluminium fasteners 17 are slid over the flanges to cover the holes. A hand operated hand tool having opposed multiple dies applies pressure to the limbs 18, 19 of the fasteners to effect welds 21, Fig. 2. The sheets 11, 12 may each be a layer of paper sandwiched between two layers of aluminium foil when the fasteners may cold weld to the foil. Instead of V-shaped fasteners separate plates may be employed one of which may extend beyond the flanges being joined to form e.g. an electrical terminal. Instead of opposed dies a single die and a backing platen may be used when one fastener only is pressed into the hole. In a further example for joining paper layers 11, 12 having metal layers 33, Fig. 7, on one side only a junction strip 32 of aluminium is inserted between the flanges to contact the metal layers and U-shaped fastener 17 is provided to cover holes 16, the fastener being cold welded through the holes to the junction strip.

As shown the oscillating driven member 2 has a collar 2' connected through a third uni-directional coupling, comprising rollers 13, to a cage 11 carried by a shaft 10 driving a roller 3 feeding strip material to a press. The roller 16 is disengaged towards the end of a feeding stroke (anticlockwise in Fig 4a) by a fixed striker 26 straddling the member 1 and engaging the projecting ends of the roller 16.

(GAINSBOROUGH) Ltd. Jan. 29, 1962 [Jan. 30, 1961], No. 3374/61. Class 94(1). A stack of folded cartons 11 is supported between guides 12, 49 and is urged forwardly into engagement with resilient stops 17 and rollers 16 by frictional engagement with endless chains 13. A finger member 38, by its helical engagement with its bearing 45, moves forwardly as it is rotated to engage behind the flap 39 to facilitate the entry of blades 33 into the collapsed carton. Motion of the blades 33 in the direction of the axis of the stack opens the leading carton, assisted by the stops 17 and roller 16, and carries it to an intermediate station where the blades 33 are withdrawn. The next pair of blades 33 similarly sets up the next carton and moves it into contact with the first carton which is then pushed into contact with the rotating drum 51 so that it passes into the nip of the roller 52 and the drum 51 to re-collapse it in the opposite direction. The blades 33 are secured to carriers 31 rotatably mounted in supports 29 carried by the endless chain 19 and the blades 33 are kept in vertical positions by the action of gears 36 which engage a stationary rack member 37.

A frequency/time transformation is then performed (156), in order to form a corresponding plurality of transformed bands, each transformed band comprising a sequence of time domain data samples. A time delay is applied (158) to at least one of the transformed bands relative to at least one other of the transformed bands. The bands are then combined (160) to produce an electrical signal waveform embodying the digital information. Finally, an optical source is modulated (162) using the electrical signal waveform, to produce a corresponding optical signal for transmission over the dispersive optical channel (106). The invention enables a reduction in the duration of guard intervals that may need to be inserted into the transmitted data blocks, in order to avoid received signal degradation due to inter-symbol interference caused by dispersion in the optical channel (106).

The transmitted optical power is distributed between the optical carrier ( 402 ) and the optical side band ( 404 ). The received optical signal is processed in order to increase the received power in the optical carrier ( 402 ) relative to the power in the optical side-band ( 404 ). The processed optical signal is detected in order to produce a corresponding electrical signal. The electrical signal is then processed in order to recover the digital information. Advantageously, increasing the optical carrier power relative to the power in the information-bearing sideband results in improved quality of the detected electrical signal, enabling an improved power budget to be achieved, which in turn allows for longer transmission distances, increased transmitted information rates, and/or improved transmission error performance as compared with conventional direct detection optical transmission systems.",OFIDIUM PTY LTD,LOWERY ARTHUR JAMES,OFIDIUM PTY.

In a network for removing an undesired component, e. g. from an error signal in an aircraft automatic guidance system, an input signal is sampled at intervals and the digital signals so produced stored and repeatedly up-dated for comparison with signals of similar form derived from a digital computer to correspond to an estimate of the desired component of the input signal. Differences between the two sets of signals should have characteristics corresponding to the undesired component and any inaccuracy in this respect is applied to repeatedly up-date the computer produced signals so that they are continuously improved and can be utilized as the output of the network for control purposes. In the arrangement described, computer selection from a family of damped oscillatory signals improves until the comparison signals are undamped and thus correspond to undesired airframe vibration components. Besides discrimination in dependence on damping discrimination may also depend on amplitude phase or frequency and the computer may deal with these characteristics in succession.",MCDONNELL AIRCRAFT CORP,HEWLETT ARTHUR JAMES,,https://lens.org/182-306-479-711-703,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H03H21/0012,H03H21/00,G3R RBD42         BD42;;G3R RB266         BD42;;G3R RX            -;;G3R R32BX         -;;G3R R7R           -;;G3R R8R           -;;G3R R9E           -;;G3R R9J           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Nov. 18, 1957 [Nov. 27, 1956], No. 36253/56. Class 40(5). In an arrangement for maintaining constant the spacing of the video (196.25 mc/s.) and audio (201.75 mc/s.) frequencies transmitted by a television transmitter, their frequency difference (5.5 mc/s.) obtained from a mixer to which they are applied is mixed with a reference frequency (4.5 mc/s.) from a crystal oscillator V9 in a second mixer stage E, and the output is supplied through an amplifier G to a discriminator H wherein variations in the input frequency from 1 m/c. develops a D.C. control signal. The discriminator includes networks R1 C1 whereby the effects of the audio frequency modulation is eradicated from the output to terminals a, b which are connected to similarly labelled terminals in the input to a free-running reactance modulated oscillator B which produces 1/36 of the final sound carrier. The audio signal which is frequency modulated on the carrier is applied to oscillator B over socket P1, transformer Tl, and cathode follower stage A and the output from B after frequency multiplicator in unit C is fed to succeeding stages of the transmitter (not shown) from output socket P2. A further crystal controlled oscillator K (5.5 mc/s.) operable by switch S2 and relay RA permits calibration of the discriminator and a meter M wherein the frequency error signal may be indicated. The meter M may be switched to measure the audio modulation or the RF output. A relay RP in the anode of a valve V13 which is held non-conducting when the spacing is correct opens the discriminator output circuit if the 1 m/c. signal fails and operates alarms. Manual regulation guided by the meter reading is included.",PYE LTD,BENNETT ARTHUR JAMES,,https://lens.org/169-687-769-013-170,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,H03L7/16,H03L7/16,H3A AXX           AXXR,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

May 31, 1962 [June 2, 1961], No. 19963/61. Heading B3H. [Also in Division G4] Apparatus for controlling a moving member, e.g. for stopping a ram on a forging press, measures the position of two points on the member and calculates the mean of the two points. In the forging press control circuit shown bidirection counters 22A, 22B operated by pulses from transducers 16, 17 indicate vertical movements of the ends of the crosshead A, B. When the counter 22A reaches a value, determined by a selector 25, corresponding to a fixed position reached by the lower end A of a tilted crosshead a gate 29A is opened and a counter 23A measures further downward movements of the end A. When it reaches a pre-set value, also determined by the selector 25, and indicating that the end A has reached a predetermined level 14, a comparator 24A produces an enabling signal on a line 65, which signal sets a trigger in a circuit 27 and also opens a gate 26B. This taps the outputs of a gate 29B to a counter 23B, which operates similarly to the counter 23A, and after delaying the pulse trains re-combines them with the original signals in a twin OR gate 28B so that the counter 23B counts two pulses for each unit of downward movement of the end B. Thus if the end B is at a height D above the end A when gate 26B is opened a signal is given on a line 56 when the end B has dropped a distance D/2. The signal on line 56 causes a second trigger in the circuit 27 to open an AND gate and stop the press in known manner. At this point the mid-point C of the crosshead is on the level 14.",DAVY & UNITED ENG CO LTD,HARRISON JAMES ARTHUR,,https://lens.org/171-335-610-418-216,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,3,0,B30B15/00;;B30B15/007;;B30B15/148;;G05B19/0405;;B30B15/007;;B30B15/148;;G05B19/0405;;B30B15/00,B30B15/00;;B30B15/14;;G05B19/04,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   An antenna apparatus that can increase capacity in a cellular communication system is disclosed. The antenna operates in conjunction with a mobile subscriber unit and comprises a plurality of antenna elements, each coupled to a respective weight control component to provide a weight to the signal transmitted from (or received by) each element. The weight for each antenna element is adjusted to achieve optimum reception during, for example, an idle mode when a pilot signal is received. The antenna array creates a beam former for signals to be transmitted from the mobile subscriber unit, and a directional receiving array to more optimally detect and receive signals transmitted from the base station. By directionally receiving and transmitting signals, multipath fading and intercell interference are greatly reduced. The weights are adjusted in a coarse and a fine mode. In the coarse mode all the weight control components are jointly adjusted or changed so that the antenna beam scans through a predetermined sector of a circle until a signal quality metric of the received signal is optimized. The coarse adjustment mode is followed by a fine adjustment mode during which the weights of are independently adjusted to further optimize the signal quality metric.

LAMSON ENGINEERING CO. Ltd. May 27, 1965 [May 28, 1964 (2)], Nos. 22105/64 and 22106/64. Heading B8A. An elevator having ascending and descending runs A, D between several floors of a building comprises an endless chain 10 carrying at spaced intervals load carriers C which pass adjacent article dispatch and receiving stations during the ascending and descending runs respectively, a mechanism associated with each of the said stations to sense the condition of the station and the adjacent carrier before initiating the dispatch or receiving operation. Each carrier comprises two horizontal article carrying arms 30, 31 secured to an arm 22 attached to the chain 10 and a back plate 20 attached to the arm 22 mounts rollers 23, 24 at top and bottom to run on guides 25, 26, 27, whereby the carrier is maintained at the same attitude throughout the full circuit. At a dispatch station, an article carriage 45, Fig. 2 (not shown), is horizontally rollable into the path of the carrier C which passes up through the carriage lifting an article thereon, therefrom. Before the dispatch carriage can move into the path of the carrier C, a series of dispatch mechanism switches must be operated. The latter comprise (in Fig. 4, not shown) a switch 101 on the carriage operated by an article thereon, a normally closed switch 105 which must remain closed indicating that there is no article already on the carriage and a switch 111 momentarily operated by the carrier as it approaches the station, to activate a holding circuit for a solenoid 120. The said switch operation indicates that an article is on the carriage ready for dispatch and the approaching article carrier C is empty, whereupon a holding circuit is established for the dispatch carriage moving mechanism. The latter mechanism comprises a link and gear arrangement, Figs. 3 and 4 (not shown), which is actuated by an extension of the ascending carrier engaging a free end of the linkage, the free end being moved into the path of said extension by a solenoid energized through the said holding circuit. The mechanism moves the carriage towards and away from the elevator whereafter the ascending carrier operates a switch for breaking the said holding circuit. The receiving mechanism and its control is similar to that of dispatch except that activation of a particular station mechanism depends on a pair of trip switches being closed by a like pair of trip levers mounted on the carrier, whereby the receiving station may be selected. A combination of trip levers carried on each carrier C is selectively set at the dispatch station by trip setting levers, Fig. 6 (not shown). The latter levers are preselected to move into a tripping position under control of a solenoid energized when the dispatch mechanism circuit is energized and are returned when the associated holding circuit is broken. In a further embodiment, Figs. 14-20 (not shown), the article is dispatched to or received from the elevator by a platform movable between a conveyer and the elevator on a parallel arm supporting structure. A linkage system associated with the structure is movable under solenoid control into the path of a sensing member on the carrier, whereupon engagement occurs and the movement of the platform is mechanically controlled by the moving carrier.",LAMSON ENGINEERING CO,BULLIVANT ARTHUR JAMES,,https://lens.org/023-707-057-968-842,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B65G17/12;;B65G17/48;;B65G2201/02,B65G17/12;;B65G17/48,B8A AMC           AMC;;B8A AR11          AMC;;B8A AV12          AMC;;B8A AV23          AMC;;B8A AV24          AMC;;B8A A1C2A3B       -;;B8A A1C2A4X       -;;B8A A1C2L2A       -;;B8A A1C2Q         -;;B8A A1C3E1        -;;B8A A1C3K         -;;B8A A1C3L2A       -;;B8A A1C3L2B       -;;B8A A1C3Q         -;;B8A A1H11B1       -;;B8A A12C          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

IMPERIAL CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES, Ltd. June 15, 1951 [June 15, 1950], No. 14950/50. Class 9(1) Blasting device for connecting detonating fuze to a plurality of explosive charges for detonation at predetermined intervals comprises a tubular metal sheath 1 surrounding a metal detonator tube 2 and connected at one end to a length 3 of flexible detonating fuze and crimped at the other end to a thick-walled tube 6 of soft rubber or neoprene. At the opposite end of the tube 6 is crimped a second metal sheath 9 joining the tube 6 to a detonator tube 12 which is surrounded by a metal sheath 11. The fuze 3 is waterproofed and has a. textile covering and a core of pentaerythritol tetranitrate. Short rigid metal tubes 7, 8, flanged at one end, are inserted in the ends of the tube 6 to keep the bore open and assist crimping of the sheaths 1, 9. The tubes 2, 12 each contain a secondary detonating charge 24 and a primary charge 23. An open-ended flanged tube 13 containing a compressed delay composition 25, preferably a lead salt of a polynitro-phenolic compound, is held in the tube 11 by a paper tube 10 and the joints between the detonator tubes and the metal sheaths are waterproofed by thin rubber tubes 29. Protuberances 15, 18 are provided on the detonator tubes to assist in positioning the sheaths 1, 9, 11. When the assembly is to be used a length 4 of detonating fuze is inserted in the open end 14 of the sheath 11 which is then crimped to to the fuze. On initiation of the fuze 3 the charges 23, 24 in the tube 2 are detonated. The flame gases enter the tube 6, bulging it out and thereby losing some energy and pass thence to ignite the delay composition 13, which in turn ignites the charges 23, 24 and fuze 4. The fuze 4 then detonates the charge attached to it. Initiation of the fuze 3 may be by a detonator, an explosive charge or a device according to the invention.

Nov. 24, 1961, No. 42158/61. Heading E2M. In a door closer comprising a housing forming a reservoir for hydraulic fluid and containing a closing spring acting upon a check piston movable in a cylinder within the housing and linked with a spindle for connecting the closer to a door, a non-return valve is provided for permitting a free flow of fluid from the main portion of the reservoir into the cylinder during the opening movement of the door, and the closing movement is controlled by a pair of separate means one of which comprises a valve adjustable independently of the other means and arranged to permit a restricted flow during the whole of the closing movement and the other of which permits a restricted flow during an initial portion of the closing movement but is inoperative during the final portion of the movement. The first means is constructed so that the flow of fluid therethrough cannot be completely cut off. The drawings show a door closer adapted to be mounted in the lintel of a door frame and comprising a pair of closing springs 31 acting on pistons 20 movable in parallel cylinders 19 and linked by piston rods 40 to a pair of parallel plates 35, 36 provided with guide slots 37, 38. These slots receive corresponding shoulders 27, 28 formed on the spindle 24, and a cam 51 secured to the spindle moves in the space between the plates and co-operates with follower rollers 43, 44, 45 rotatable on shafts 48-50 mounted in the plates. Hold-open recesses 53 and hold-closed recesses 54 are formed in the cam surface. The cylinders 19 are connected by ports 80 to a bore 75 containing the first of the separate control means, which comprises a valve 70 screwed into the partition 18 between the cylinders to control the flow of fluid from the inner ends of the cylinders via a bore 79 to the main portion of the reservoir. A slight clearance between the valve stem 71 and the bore 75 prevents complete closure of the valve. The other control means comprises a tapered groove 65 in the wall of one of the cylinders which co-operates with the corresponding piston over the initial portion of the closing movement. In a modification the groove is replaced by a second valve similar to the valve 70 but spaced from the inner ends of the cylinders. A non-return valve 58 is provided in each of the pistons.",JACKSON EXIT DEVICE CORP,HEWLETT ARTHUR JAMES,,https://lens.org/043-498-110-339-146,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,E05F3/104;;E05Y2800/21;;E05Y2900/132,E05F3/10,E2M M11F2         -;;E2M M12E1C        -;;E2M M12F1A        -;;E2M M25           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

SHELL REFINING & MARKETING CO., Ltd. June 5, 1952 [July 12, 1951], No. 16544/51. Class 21 [Also in Groups XVIII and XXVIII] In apparatus for supplying liquid under pressure from a supply source to a container (e.g. the fuel tank of an aircraft) through a pipeline system, a predetermined vacuum is maintained in an auxiliary container by an eductor connected in and operated by the flow of liquid into the main container, under control of a by-pass valve across the eductor regulated by a piston and cylinder connected to the auxiliary container vacuum, a duct connects the auxiliary vacuum container through a control valve to the pipeline system and/or the main container, and valves are provided for isolating the supply source, whereby the liquid may be withdrawn as required from the pipeline and/or main container into the auxiliary container after a supply operation, and from thence to the main line through the eductor during the next supply operation. Fig. 4 shows a fuel-dispensing system for aircraft in which reels 38, 39 mounted on a truck 37 carry hoses which are respectively coupled through automatic valves to a dispersing point 46 of a static pipe system, and to the tank of the aircraft through its internal pipework. The hoses are interconnected on the truck through a pressure control valve 41 of the kind described in Specification 668,451, [Group XXIX], a controlled eductor 1, a filter 42, and air eliminator 43, and a meter 44, while an auxiliary container 15 in which a controlled vacuum is maintained by the eductor is conneoted to the system between the filter and the air eliminator through a control valve 27A Figs. 1, 2 show the controlled eductor system, which is connected as a by-pass across a butterfly fuel valve 3 in the main fuel line tending to be closed by the liquid flow, to create a vacuum in the container 15 through a non-return valve 5 and pipe 4. The butterfly valve is controllable through a linkage 7, 8, by a springloaded piston 9 moving in a cylinder 10 so as to close the butterfly valve when atmospheric pressure prevails on both sides of the cylinder. The latter is connected through a leaking non-return valve 22 to a port 21 of the cylinder 17 of a pilot valve 13, which is also ported through a pipe 14 to the vacuum container. A spring- loaded plunger 16 within the cylinder 17 has a port 25 connected to atmosphere through a central bore 26 and a lower port 23 connected by a peripheral channel 24 to pipe 14 and through an axial channel 19 to the space within the cylinder. Initially plunger 16 is positioned so that cylinder 10 is connected to atmosphere through ports 21, 25 and valve 22. Valve 3 is closed and the pressurized fuel flow to the aircraft is diverted through eductor 1, whereby vacuum is developed in container 15. Plunger 16 rises against its spring, and at a predetermined container vacuum connects cylinder 10 to vacuum through ports 21, 23 and channel 24, and non- return valve 22, which closes but leaks so that after a time delay, the vacuum in the cylinder suffices to open valve 3 and reduce the eductor suction so as to just maintain the predetermined vacuum. On completion of the supply operation, the hoses are disconnected, whereupon their automatic valves close so that on opening valve 27A the fuel in the system is sucked back into the container 15, any fuel which has passed the motor traversing it in the reverse direction. The delivery hose may be left attached to the aircraft whereby fuel may be sucked from pipelines and/or tanks therein. During the subsequent fuelling operation, the fuel accumulated in the container 15 is drawn by the eductor into the main delivery stream. Fig. 3 shows a modified pilot valve for preventing air leaks wherein a ported airtight sleeve surrounds the springloaded plunger 16, and projects beyond the cylinder bore so as to be sealed by a resilient washer fixed to the plunger when vacuum is applied to the cylinder 17 and the plunger moves to the right. The central bore 26 venting to atmosphere is also closed by a spring-loaded valve 31, which is opened by projection 34 when atmosphere is applied to the cybinder 17 and the plunger moves to the left. The atmospheric inlet 35 has a dust filter 36.",SHELL REFINING & MARKETING CO,WOOLDRIDGE JAMES ARTHUR,,https://lens.org/034-732-777-182-067,Granted Patent,no,0,3,1,1,0,B64F1/28;;F04F5/52,B64F1/28;;F04F5/52,B8N NJM           NJM;;B8N N24D1         NJM;;B8N N24E6         NJM;;F1R R12           R12,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The molar ratio of mordant to aldehyde may be between 1 : 5 and 1 : 150. The cells may first treated with the mordant, next the aldehyde and then with the antigen although satisfactory results may be obtained by adding the aldehyde before the mordant or a mixture of aldehyde and mordant. It may be necessary to have a buffer present to minimise any fall of pH occuring on mixing the mordant with the aldehyde e.g. by using a phosphate buffer. The mordant may be a hydroquinone (a cross-conjugated aromatic diol capable of oxidation to quinones) e.g. toluene-2, 5 -diol, naphthalene-1, 4-and -2, 6-diols but preferable benzene-1, 4-diol. In addition the corresponding quinones and other benzene, toluene and naphthalene diols may be used. The antigens exemplified are chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), g -globulin and bovine serum albumin. The red cells used are conveniently those obtained from sheep but cells of other mammalian species including the ox, horse, rabbit and man may be used. Specific examples of process to yield HCG and g -globulin sensitized cells as in Specification 1,036,591 are given together with buffer solutions suitable for use in these processes. This reagent can be used to detect protein antigens for example in body fluids, among such antigens are chorionic gonodotropin (HCG), (HCG), serum albumin, g -globulin, insulin, tetanus toxoid and diptheria toxoid. When used to detect HCG in pregnancy urine, the reaction forms the basis of an in vitro test for pregnancy and such an application is disclosed.",WELLCOME FOUND,FULTHORPE ARTHUR JAMES,,https://lens.org/065-330-261-921-44X,Granted Patent,no,0,1,18,22,0,G01N33/76;;G01N33/76;;G01N33/555;;G01N33/555;;G01N33/556;;G01N33/556;;Y10S436/814;;Y10S436/814;;Y10S436/818;;Y10S436/818;;Y10S436/826;;Y10S436/826,G01N33/555;;G01N33/556;;G01N33/76,G1B B11D          B11&;;G1B B11E          B11&;;G1B B11M          B11&;;G1B B22A          B11&,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

[Also in Division B1] A feed mixer comprises a frame 11 supported on ground wheels 12, a mixing hopper 14 having a mixing auger (not shown) therein, a hammer mill 15, a loading auger 16, and an unloading auger 17, all of which are driven from the power take-off of a tractor via a transmission drive comprising three shafts 18, 28, 39 mounted substantially parallel to each other longitudinally on frame 11, shafts 28 and 39 being connected to shaft 18 by chains 33 and 37 and gang sprockets 32, 31 and (38), (36), Fig. 3 (not shown), mounted on their respective shafts. One end of the shafts 18 and 28 have splines 21 and 30, respectively, each corresponding to the number of splines on the power take-off output shaft of a tractor, which shaft in one standard tractor revolves at approximately 540 r.p.m. and in another standard tractor revolves at approximately 1000 r.p.m. Shaft 18 is geared to a pulley 22 which is connected to a smaller pulley (not shown), by a belt 23, to drive the hammer mill 15 of the mixer. Shaft 39 provides the drive to the mixing auger in the hopper 14, to the unloading auger 17, and to other components of the mobile feed mixer. Hence the drive to all components is transmitted from shaft 18. A power take-off transmission shaft assembly 40, Figs. 4, 5, and 6 (not shown) interconnects the mixer to the power take-off shaft of a tractor. In use with a tractor whose output shaft revolves at 540 r.p.m., the tractor output shaft is connected to the end (47), Figs. 4 and 6 (not shown), and the end (45), Figs. 4 and 5 (not shown), is connected to the splined end 30 of the shaft 28 causing shaft 28 to revolve at 540 r.p.m. and shaft 18 to revolve at 1000 r.p.m., since the ratio of drive between gang sprockets 31 and 32 is approximately 2: 1. Alternatively, in use with a tractor whose output shaft revolves at 1000 r.p.m., shaft assembly 40 is turned end for end, the end (45) being connected to the output shaft of the tractor and the end (47) being connected to the splined end 21 of shaft 18, thus causing shaft 18 to revolve at 1000 r.p.m. and shaft 28 to revolve at 540 r.p.m.",LUSCOMBE ARTHUR JAMES,LUSCOMBE ARTHUR JAMES,,https://lens.org/103-902-155-878-369,Granted Patent,no,0,1,2,2,0,A01B71/066;;A23N17/02;;F16D1/116;;F16D2001/103;;A01B71/066;;F16D1/116;;A23N17/02,A01B71/06;;A23N17/02;;F16D1/116,B1C CAEB          CAEB;;B1C C102          CAEB;;B1C C16           -;;B1C C18A1         -;;B1C C6            -;;B1C C624          CAEB;;B1C C642          CAEB;;B1C C661          CAEB;;B1C C687          CAEB;;B1C C8            -;;B1C C9            -;;B7H HDF           HDF;;B7H HM5B          -;;B7H HV4C          HV4/,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

(GAINSBOROUGH) Ltd. Aug. 14, 1959 [Aug. 15, 1958], No. 26256/58. Class 73. Relates to a labelling machine for applying labels to rectangular packages, the labels extending over one side and the two end faces of the package. Packages 26, Fig. 1 are fed from a feed channel 27 to the successive pockets 11 of an intermittently rotating pocket wheel 10 by a reciprocating pusher 28 and are ejected by a similar pusher 31 at a diametrically opposite station. A middle gum bar wheel 16 formed with middle gum bars 17 is driven synchronously with the pocket wheel 10 by a pair of chains 23 engaging sprockets 13 and 19, Fig. 2 secured to the shafts of the wheels 10 and 16. The chains 23 carry end gum bars 24 at spaced intervals corresponding to the circumferential pitch of the middle gum bars 17 and the pockets 11. The pairs of end gum bars 24 are spaced laterally by a distance slightly greater than the length of the middle gum bars 17 so that the latter pass into the spaces between the bars 24 to form, in effect, a single gum bar corresponding in length with labels 59 contained in a magazine 44, the end gum bars 24 moving into register with the middle gum bars 17 or the pockets 11 at each intermittent movement of the apparatus. The bars 17, 24 lie in the same plane as they pass in contact with a gumming roller 51 and also as they rest in position opposite a reciprocating label magazine 44 where they extract a label 59. As the wheel 16 rotates, the gum bar 17 moves out of the plane of the gum bars 24, thus leaving the gummed label 59 bridging the gap between the end bars 24 which subsequently dwell in register with a pocket 11 at the delivery station. A package 26 is ejected and passes between the gum bars 24 to engage the label 59 and carry it into a folding channel 61 consisting of a pair of spaced brushes 62, Fig. 3 (not shown), serving to fold over the end portions of the label 59 on to the end faces of the package.",ROSE BROTHERS LTD,KAY JAMES ARTHUR,,https://lens.org/176-433-223-291-615,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,B65C9/16,B65C9/16,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

DISTILLERS CO. Ltd. March 4, 1960 [March 7, 1959], No. 7967/59. Class 38 (4). [Also in Group XXVIII] Vaporizing apparatus for a readily vaporizable liquid such as liquid carbon dioxide or liquid petroleum gases comprises a heating vessel 1 having an inlet port 2 for connection to a storage tank containing the vaporizable liquid and an outlet port 4 for connection to a gas delivery pipe 5, the heating vessel containing three heating elements 7, 8, 9 with an associated temperature responsive device 10, 11, 12 respectively, the temperature responsive devices controlling the supply to the heating elements. Whilst the vaporizer is idle, the liquid vaporizes until the liquid pressure is balanced by the gas pressure in the vessel 1. Opening of a valve 6 allows the gas to be used with a consequent further generation of gas in the vessel 1 with a concomitant drop in the temperature in the vessel. The passage of the liquid through the inlet port 2 causes a temperature responsive device to operate to close a switch 17 whereby the electric supply circuit is closed. The drop of temperature in the vessel 1 causes the temperature responsive devices 10, 11, 12 to operate in succession to close switches 13, 14, 15 respectively so that the heating elements 7, 8, 9 maintain the supply of gas. As the demand for gas diminishes, the temperature at the top of the vessel rises, whereupon the temperature responsive device 12 causes the heating element 9 to be switched off. A further reduction in demand will cause the heating element 8 to be switched off and so on. Other temperature responsive devices, to control the heating elements, may be placed in the delivery pipe 5. A fusible link 26 is provided adjacent the vessel 1 which link ruptures should the temperature of the vessel rise above a predetermined limit, whereupon a switch 25 opens to remove the electric supply from the apparatus.

SOLUTION: This method for forming a multi-layered paper web comprises using a twin wire former 20 having a lower part wire 36 traveling between an open mesh paper forming roll 38 and a reverse rotating roll 66. An upper part wire 44 merges with the lower part wire 36 on the paper forming roll 38, and these upper and lower part wires travel through a downward bent passage as a whole, or a paper forming region. A surface layer paper web 26 is formed between the upper and lower part wires. The flow of a paper material from a head box 23, is delivered on the lower part wire 36 at the point where the lower part wire 36 is wound to the paper forming roll 38. The lower part wire 36 merges with the upper part wire 44 at a point approaching the top point of the paper forming roll 38. Since the upper surface of the paper web is dehydrated by the tension of the wires and a centrifugal force, fine fibers and fillers are not removed during the dehydration. The reverse rotating roll 66 fixes the upper surface of the paper web with a base-layered paper web 24 on a base layer wire 22.",BELOIT TECHNOLOGIES INC,JAMES ARTHUR TURNER,,https://lens.org/050-414-582-826-084,Patent Application,no,0,0,2,2,0,,D21F9/02;;D21F9/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Aug. 26, 1963 [Aug. 27, 1962], No. 32889/62. Heading A4C. [Also in Division B8] In a machine for skinning bananas, the latter are fed in succession to a cutting station 36 at which they are cut transversely into halves which are then fed endwise with the cut ends trailing to a skinning station having two gripping elements, such as rollers 44, which grip the uncut ends and draw the skin but not the fruit through a gap between the elements. Bananas from a conveyer 1 are fed via an oscillating chute 3 along inclined plates 4 and 13 to be carried and washed in a water stream from nozzles 20 and a pipe 17 between two of a plurality of guide plates 13A and to be then carried on fingers 29 upstanding from a conveyer 23 having two open-mesh belts 25 along the upper run 23B on which they are dried by a blower 31. The bananas are transferred from the end of the conveyer 23 to a first feeding means comprising a plurality of side-byside lower conveyer belts 33 carrying banana engaging lugs 34 and a corresponding series of upper conveyer belts 35. The rollers 33A, 35A carrying the belts 33, 35 and mounted respectively on common shafts but each roller 33A, 35A is independently spring urged to cater for varying thickness of bananas carried between the belts 33, 35. Between each adjacent pair of belts 33, 35 is mounted a cutter blade 36 which cuts into halves bananas fed transversely thereto. The cut halves are re-orientated through 90 degrees by diverters 37 aligned with the cutters 36 and transferred in channels defined between the diverters 37 and guide plates 38 to a second feeding means comprising a conveyer 39 formed of a plurality of spaced belts connected by groups of cross wires 43. Banana halves carried on the conveyer 39 have their skins cut longitudinally on opposite sides by knives located within the guide channels. Each banana half after being cut longitudinally is fed by the conveyer 39 to have its uncut end gripped between and drawn by one of a plurality of pairs of contra-rotating rollers 44 whereby the skin passes between the rollers 44 to be discharged on to a conveyer 45 and the fruit is squeezed out of the skin to pass through a gap between groups of wires 43 and on to a conveyer 46. Bananas inadvertently adhered to the conveyer 39 are removed from the lower arm by a stripper 47 and the lower run is cleaned by a brush 48. In an alternative arrangement the washing part of the apparatus is omitted and bananas are fed from a hopper to a separating device which delivers the bananas in spaced rows to the lower conveyer belts 33.",VICKERS ARMSTRONGS LTD,HALLIWELL JAMES ARTHUR,,https://lens.org/056-829-599-406-96X,Granted Patent,no,0,6,1,1,0,A23N7/00,A23N7/00,A4C CA            CA;;A4C C102          CA;;A4C C116          CA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

GENERAL ELECTRIC CO. Ltd. May 26, 1961 [May 30, 1960], No. 19036/60. Class 83 (4). A welding electrode arrangement for tubes, rings, caps and like annular workpieces 40, Fig. 1, comprises a mandrel 1 carrying or forming a first electrode arranged to extend within the workpiece, and a second electrode 8 which is of annular form, arranged to encircle the workpiece, and have an internal work-engaging face to co-operate with the first electrode, the electrodes being rotatable one relative to the other so that during a welding operation different circumferential parts of the workpiece pass between co-operating portions of the electrodes. As described, the workpiece consists of a cap 40 which is to be welded into the end of a tube 38, the tube being clamped by a ring 31 of rubber which is disposed in a cylinder 32 and compressed on to the tube by a sleeve 33 connected to a handle 34. The sleeve 33 and cylinders 32 are connected by gears 36, a rod 27 and gears 28 to a member 25 carrying the electrode 1 and rotatable in a bush 26 by a motor 23. The second electrode 8 is secured to a bush 6 rotatably mounted in bearings 7 in a housing 5 of a welding head 2 secured to a column 3 movable vertically by hydraulic or pneumatic means to bring the internal surface of the electrode 8 into engagement with the workpiece ; the electrode is adjustable axially of the workpiece by means of a slide 21. Current is supplied to the electrode 8 from a contact 16 spring-urged into engagement with the bush 6 which is insulated from the head by insulating members 13. During welding, the motor 23 rotates the electrode 1 and the workpiece 38, the electrode 8 being pressed against the workpiece so as to rotate by frictional engagement therewith. Cooling water may be supplied to the contact 26 and electrode 8. In an alternative embodiment, the head 2, Fig. 3, for the electrode 8 is adjustable transversely of the axis of the workpiece by a slide 43 and eccentric 41, and a gauge 46 indicates the contact pressure between the electrode and the workpiece by measuring the deflection of a beam 45 on which the column 3 bears.",GEN ELECTRIC CO LTD,DONELAN JAMES ARTHUR,,https://lens.org/068-975-210-173-098,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B23K11/093,B23K11/093,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Postans, A. J. Jan. 18. Gas and like engines.-Sparks for exploding the gases are produced by breaking a circuit of large self-induction. A revolving cam driven by the crank shaft closes a switch b, Fig. 1, in the circuit of a battery a. The wire from the battery goes to one terminal of a coil c having an iron core, while the wire from the key b goes to the plug f, which is screwed into the cylinder, and communicates with the bridge k<1> carrying one of the sparking terminals k. A metal rod h passing through an insulator inside the sparking-plug f is normally held in contact with the terminal k by springs d<1>, d<2> secured by a screw to an insulated bracket e, and communicating with the coil c by an arm d. The iron core of the coil c, when energized, attracts two counterweighted armatures l<1>, carried by an iron rod l mounted in suitable bearings. The armatures l<1> are normally held out of contact with the iron core by the action of a spring m on a suitably-formed part of the rod l. One end of a finger o pivoted in a slot in the rod l moves in a cam slot in the casing of the coil c or in an attachment. When the armatures l<1> are attracted, the finger comes in contact with an insulated collar o<1> mounted on the spindle h, and so makes a spark gap between that spindle and the terminal k. The finger o at the same time slightly rotates the spindle h, and so equalizes the wear. If the gases explode before the cam leaves the contact b the spark gap is broken by the pressure of the gases forcing the rod b outwards. Fig. 4 shows the arrangement of the battery circuit of a four-cylinder engine. Four contacts p which are successively acted on by a revolving cam are each connected to one terminal of the battery a.",POSTANS ARTHUR JAMES,POSTANS ARTHUR JAMES,,https://lens.org/108-826-452-831-25X,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

June 11, 1954, No. 17223/54. Class 35. [Also in Group XL (a)] A method of manufacturing a magnet system consisting of two magnetic poles separated by an air gap comprises the steps of magnetizing a magnet body to saturation to provide a permanent magnet and then reducing the flux density of the magnet by 10 to 50 per cent of the value to which it drips when the magnetizing field is removed, and comprises also the step of providing the magnet body with a non-ferromagnetic sheath 4 whose thickness is greatest and least at those portions of the body which are respectively at and furthest from the gap.

Preferably, the stator magnets have opposite poles isolated from each other and pointed inward towards the rotor. The rotor will preferably have two appendages. The 1st appendage (called the major appendage for this design) will consist of a highly ferrous, magnetic material with tightly wound coils that will form a magnetic field when introduced to a magnetic field that is generated and collapsed at a frequency of from 0 to 50 khz. The 2nd appendage (called the minor appendage for this design) will consist of a highly ferrous, magnetic material, with a dimension less than or greater than but not the same as the 1st appendage with tightly wound coils numbered more than or less than but not the same as the 1st appendage. The number of appendages on the rotor may be increased or decreased as required. The number of appendages may vary from 1 to infinity. The height of the appendages is limited by the inside of the inside diameter of the motor housing chamber. The rotor will be attached to the drive shaft. The drive shaft will be constructed with non-ferrous material. The inner chamber of the motor that houses the rotor will be filled with a medium that will be used as a dielectric. This medium may vary from air to magnetic liquids. This project will use synthetic oil rated at 5W-30. This medium was chosen because the thermal rating exceeds the curie temperature of a magnet. The stator consists of low voltage high current magnetic blocks located a determined number of degrees apart from each other. These magnetic blocks will be sequenced on at a rate of 0-50 khz for this design. Higher rates may be used for future designs to increase the torque to horsepower ratio. The low voltage high current magnetic blocks will be controlled by controller digital outputs capable of sequencing on/off at a rate sufficient to satisfy the design.",RUSH JAMES ARTHUR,RUSH JAMES ARTHUR,,https://lens.org/161-837-069-966-501,Patent Application,yes,10,0,1,1,0,H02K17/12;;H02K17/12;;H02K99/20;;H02K99/20,H02K17/12,310/166,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

SHELL REFINING & MARKETING CO., Ltd. July 18, 1952 [July 31, 1951], No. 18073/51. Class 135 A liquid dispensing system, e.g. an aircraft fuelling system, comprises a pump 1, Fig. 1, a delivery line 5 connecting the discharge s'de 4 of the pump to at least one dispensing point controlled by a valve 8 and containing a non-return valve 6 permitting flow from the pump, and a bye-pass line between the discharge and suction sides of the pump and controlled by a valve 13. This valve varies the flow through the bye-pass in accordance with the pressure at a point 11 between the valve 6 and the dispensing point or points. The pressure is that at the throat of a Venturi 7 and actuates a pilot valve member 44, Fig. 2, controlling a piston 22 connected to the bye-pass valve closure member 17. Pump discharge and suction are connected to chamber 23, 24, respectively on opposite sides of valve seat 20. With the pilot valve closed, the pressure in chamber 23 holds member 17 seated due to the piston 22 being larger than the member. When the pressure at point 11, acting on a piston 43, overcomes a spring 33 the pilot valve opens to admit pressure liquid through ports 46, 47 to the rear of piston 22 to unseat member 17. If flow through the Venturi ceases due to closure of all valves 8, the pressure becomes sufficient to move piston out of bore 39 whereupon the pressure acts on an addition piston 42 to urge the valve member 44 against stop 34 and member 17 moves to fully open position against a stop 25. Due to the additional area of piston 42, the pilot valve will not close until the pressure at point 11 drops below the initial opening pressure. On closure of the pilot valve, the liquid behind the piston 22 bleeds off through a bore 28 in the piston and member 17 to permit the member 17 to be seated. The liquid entering the chamber 35 containing piston 42 leaks away through bores 49, 50 in the member 44 and a port 45. A pressure storage vessel 14 in line 5 compensates for any leakage which may occur when all valves 8 are closed.",SHELL REFINING & MARKETING CO,WOOLDRIDGE JAMES ARTHUR,,https://lens.org/014-135-854-981-540,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,B64F1/28,B64F1/28,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

LTV LING ALTEC Inc. 22 Sept., 1966, No. 42415/66. Heading H2F. A rectifying circuit using controlled rectifiers such as thyristors has its output voltage maintained constant for varying input voltage by firing the controlled rectifiers at the instant when a voltage proportional to the input voltage falls below a direct reference voltage. The invention is described with reference to a three-phase thyristor bridge (Fig. 1, not shown). A first control circuit (Fig. 5, not shown) receives both phase and line voltages to obtain the voltage proportional to the input voltage for each phase. This is compared with a common reference voltage and used to fire a silicon controlled switch in the control circuit of the associated thyristor. An alternative control circuit has for each phase a Schmitt trigger (Fig. 6, not shown) which is switched by the difference of the two control voltages to give thyristor firing signals through a pulse transformer (70).",LTV LING ALTEC INC,ROSS JAMES ARTHUR,,https://lens.org/152-839-766-548-519,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H02M7/1623,H02M7/162,H2F FSC           FSC;;H2F FSF           F9B2;;H2F F15           -;;H2F F9B2          -;;H2F F9H3          -;;H2F F9K1          -;;H2F F9N2A         -;;H2F F9N3D         -;;H2F F9P1          -;;H2F F9Q           -;;H2F F9R19C        -;;H2F F9R21C        F9B2;;H2F F9R26C        -;;H2F F9R42C        -;;H2F F9R8C         -;;H2F F9T1          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

MASSON SEELEY & CO., Ltd. Dec. 18, 1951 [Dec. 18, 1950], No. 30821/50. Class 78 (1) [Also in Group XVI] A conveyer comprises an endless chain &c. 3 adapted to feed folded articles to a marking machine and a marking bed located over the conveyer and spaced therefrom by a distance sufficient to permit a folded article to pass thereunder whilst allowing the uppermost fold of the article to pass over the upper surface of the marking bed for co-operation with the marking means. In the machine shown for marking the foot or welt 25 of stockings folded in boxes 1 the chain 3 is mounted on a sprocket at each end, the sprocket 4 at the delivery end being driven by a motor 7 through a variable speed mechanism 8, a reduction gear 9, and a driving shaft 10, a crank 11 mounted on the latter being coupled by means of a link 12 to a rocker arm 13 pivoted to the shaft 14 carrying sprocket 4. The rocker arm 13 carries a pawl 15 which engages and imparts a step by step motion to a ratchet wheel 16 also mounted on shaft 14 and thus drives the sprocket 4. The pawl and ratchet mechanism functions as a one way drive and enables the chain to be adjusted for registration purposes. Adjustment of this step by step motion may be provided, e.g. by adjustment of the throws of the crank and/or the rocker arm. The chain is supported by guide rails 17, and provided with bifurcated projections 18 which push the trailing ends of the boxes 1. The boxes are carried in the tilted position by guide rails 19, 20. The operator unfolds the welt or foot of the stocking from the box and lays it on a supporting plate 21 disposed at one side of the conveyer. The press may be of the kind having a reciprocating head on which the die is mounted and co-operates with a pigment coated foil or other carrier disposed between the head and the work, and a platform 6 forming the lower platen of the press is arranged near the delivery end of the apparatus. The welt or foot is folded from the support plate 21 on to the platform 6 by means of a lifting plate 22, rear support plate 23 which is in alignment with platform 6, and a turnover plate 24. Progressive positions of a box are shown at 1a, 1b and 1c. The welt or foot is raised above the level of the higher side of the box 1 by the upwardly inclined lifting plate 22, and, as the box passes beneath plate 23, is turned over by the diagonally arranged plate 24 on to plate 23 so that the box 1 passes under and the welt or foot over plate 23 and platform 6. When the box emerges from platform 6 the welt 25 drops into the box into its original folded position. A guard plate 26 is placed over the conveyer in the zone adjacent the entrance to the turnover station, and the marking station is surrounded by a transparent plastic guard. A series of switches for stopping the motor are provided along the frame 2. The marking machine is preferably driven by a separate motor controlled by the conveyer drive, thus the separate motor may include a clutch operated by a cable 28 secured to a pivotally mounted lever 29 carrying a cam follower 30 which co-operates with a cam 31 mounted on the shaft 10. To adjust the mechanism the cable may be adjustably secured to the lever 29 and the cam may be adjustably secured to shaft 10, e.g. by a bolt 32 passing through an arcuate slot 33 in the cam 31 and secured to crank 11 or a flange on shaft 10. The movement of the chain is preferably such that each step brings a box to the marking station, and the conveyer drive can be adjusted to vary the rate of feed and period of dwell. Preferably the dwell period of the marking head is also adjustable.",MASSON SEELEY AND COMPANY LTD,HARRIS ARTHUR JAMES,,https://lens.org/156-693-930-906-194,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,D06H1/00,D06H1/00,B6C CBAC          BAC;;B6C CBAF          BAF;;B6C C102          BAC;;B6C C183          BAC;;B6C C221          BAC;;B6C C284          BAC;;B6J JC            JC;;B8A AF            AF;;B8A AR16          AF;;B8A AR8           AF,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

June 21. Tinning and similarly coating metals by dipping. -Relates to automatic machines for catching and removing the plates as they emerge from the rolls in a tinning - pot. The plate is caught by a gripper on the arm 10 which is loosely mounted on a continuously - revolving shaft 1, and is clutched thereto, as soon as a plate enters the grippers, by electromagnetic means. When the arm is moving over, it is uncoupled from the shaft and returned by frictional contact with the spring face of a drum 48, which is driven in the opposite direction to the shaft 1 by belting through the second shaft 57. The gripper, shown separately in Fig. 4, is mounted on the arm 10 at right angles as shown in Fig 1, or parallel thereto if the machine is placed at the end of the pot. The plate rises between the guides 25, 29 and strikes the switch lever 31, thereby breaking the circuit of an electromagnet 43, which liberates the pawl 15 that connects the arm 10 to the shaft. As the arm turns, a switch thereon, normally held open by an adjustable stop 66, closes and completes the circuit to the electromagnet 23, which then attracts its armature 27 on the pivoted arm 22 and grips the plate. At the end of the stroke of the arm, the same switch is opened by a second stop to release the plate, and the pawl 15 is tripped by a fixed stop to disconnect the arm from the shaft. The removal of the plate allows the switch 31 to close the circuit of the electromagnet 43 which holds the pawl during the return. The arm 10 is counterbalanced and provided with a spring-hinged joint 72 at the middle.",MASKREY ARTHUR JAMES,MASKREY ARTHUR JAMES,,https://lens.org/193-579-721-179-237,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Separation of liquids from hydrocarbon gas streams. REED ROLLER BIT CO. Jan. 15, 1965 No. 1999/65. Heading B1L. During the low temperature separation of liquids from a flowing hydrocarbon gas stream, the formation of solid hydrocarbon hydrates is inhibited by supplying the gas under pressure through a restricted connection to a separating vessel, and passing the expanded gas through a body of deliquescent dehydrating material to form a brine, at least a portion of the brine being directed into the restricted connection for mixing with the incoming gas stream. Make-up liquid may be added to the deliquescent material to form additional brine to increase the overall brine concentration; the supply of make-up liquid may be controlled in response to the density of the brine collected at the bottom of the separating vessel, the temperature of the expanded gas stream at its entry into the vessel or its rate of flow into the vessel. or the make-up liquid may be supplied at fixed time intervals. In the embodiment of Fig. 1, gas stream in line 37 passes into water knock-out vessel 35 and is supplied by line 34 to choke 36. (Figs. 4. 5 not shown).
