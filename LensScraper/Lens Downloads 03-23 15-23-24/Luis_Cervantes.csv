A side edge part is folded to prevent inward bending, and to prevent inappropriately mounting on a jaw part 15 of a rotary plate 11. The carrier is mounted on the rotary plate 11 provided with the jaw part 15 after the side edge part is folded. The jaw part 15 is provided with two screw holes for mounting on the plate 11 by screws, and two guide holes for positioning. A groove is formed in the rotary plate 11 for reducing the weight, the power is transmitted to a drive shaft through a gear, the constitution of the device is simplified, and the manufacturing cost, the weight, and the noise are reduced thereby.",ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS,CERVANTES FRANCISCO;;MIGUEL-DIAZ LUIS,,https://lens.org/048-774-788-734-684,Patent Application,no,0,1,24,24,0,B65B17/025;;B65B61/06;;B65B27/00;;B65B21/00;;B65B61/06;;B65B17/025,B65B17/02;;B65B35/46;;B65B61/06;;B65B65/02;;B65B21/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

This fibre is traditionally known as silk filament and was historically used as suture and fishing lines. When the silk filament is illuminated on one end with conventional or laser light, it emits light laterally along various centimetres.

The system comprises a memory unit, a data entry unit, a graphical interface, a central processing unit; configured together to execute an algorithm that makes possible the execution of a method for determining failure consequences in industrial facilities, comprising: The main purpose of the present invention is to establish a procedure to determine the associated costs of the possible consequences generated from faults in the components present in industrial facilities. This method is based on a mathematical model with financial focus, considering the impacts associated with an undesired event, allowing the operator to visualize by impact categories in the analyzed components and generate different scenarios to identify the variables that contribute with a higher index of affectation on the installation to be able to implement actions or measures to reduce and/or mitigate hazards. The proposed method considers the structure definition of the model, the relationship of three main impacts: Population, Environment and Business; and of three 20 basic factors: Receiver, Danger and Reduction. The consequence of the installation failure is the sum of the financial exposures by impact type. For a more specific analysis, the result can be obtained determining failure consequences from the component level, up to the installation level in economic terms.",SERVIN SOLUCIONES Y SERVICIOS INTEGRALES,LORENZO MARTINEZ GOMEZ;;JORGE JOAQUÍN CANTÓ IBÁÑEZ;;DIEGO MARTÍNEZ MARTÍNEZ DE LA ESCALERA;;JAIME CERVANTES AGUILAR;;JESÚS ESCOBAR LINARES;;GUILLERMO JAVIER MARTÍNEZ RIVERA;;JOSÉ LUIS MARTÍNEZ GONZALEZ,,https://lens.org/086-336-291-695-155,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,,G06Q10/06;;G06F9/44;;G06Q30/04;;G06Q40/08,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Three genetic constructions were performed, wherein the sequences encoding for peptides KETc1, KETc7 and KETc12 from the cysticercus T. crassiceps were independently donated to the expression vector pUl235-5.1. Said constructions were used for transforming, by biobalistics, embryogenic papaya (Carica papaya) callus. The embryogenic callus were co-transformed with each one of the genetic construction in the vector pUl235-5.1 and the vector pWRG1515 which contain the GUS reporter gene that encodes for the (-glucuronidase) enzyme (Christou et al., 1995). The transformed callus were selected and isolated in a selective medium with antibiotics. The ability of expression and immunogenicity of the produced clones were confirmed. Based on the immunogenic ability of the clones, the clones 6p (KETC12.6 His), 9p (KETc1. 6 His) and 23p (KETc7) were selected therefrom, the same being spread, preserved and started the regeneration process in vitro.",UNIV MEXICO NACIONAL AUTONOMA,ESTRELLA LUIS HERRERA;;CONDE EDDA LYDIA SCIUTTO;;GONZALEZ RUTILIA MARISELA HERNANDEZ;;GONZALEZ GLADIS DEL CARMEN FRAGOSO;;CERVANTES JACQUELYNNE BRENDA;;CASILLAS FERNANDO LOPEZ;;GARCIA ANGEL ARTURO GUEVARA;;PONCE JOSE LUIS CABRERA;;RAMIREZ CLAUDIA GERALDINE LEON;;SALGADO GABRIELA ROSAS,,https://lens.org/103-721-732-151-782,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,C12N15/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The present invention is a records renaming unit that is characterized by implementing a method in which five tasks are executed concurrently during a clock cycle through different structures operating synchronously. The source and destination logical records associated with an instruction are assigned to a physical record implemented in the processor micro-architecture through the reading of a memory. A true dependency detection block is implemented through a network consisting of basic check and routing cells. Likewise, a detection block of old-premature records helps to resolve the output dependencies in an optimized way.
