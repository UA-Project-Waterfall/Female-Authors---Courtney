Cases are moved through the machine by a chain-driven flight bar conveyor mechanism. Case entry is prevented by a raised gate until the flight bar conveyor mechanism is synchronized. Thereafter, the gate is lowered and a power roller feeds the case into the machine. After entering the machine, a case is pushed through the machine by the flight bar conveyor mechanism. The programmable case sealing machine can be programmed to seal the top and/or bottom of the case. If the bottom is to be sealed, the bottom major flaps of the case are separated from the bottom minor flaps by a T-deck mechanism as the case enters the machine. If the bottom of the case was previously sealed, the T-deck is rendered inoperative by the program. As the case proceeds through the programmable case sealing machine, the leading one of the top minor flaps is folded rearwardly so as to lie between the top major flaps. Then, if the top of the case is to be sealed, a kicker is actuated to fold the trailing top minor flap forwardly, between the top major flaps. The duration of both the T-deck and kicker functions is programmable. The case is then moved between top and bottom glue heads, which apply glue (if programmed to do so) to the flaps in a programmed pattern. The case sealing machine can be programmed to apply glue in a stitch (e.g., intermittent) pattern or a continuous pattern. After the glue is applied, the top major flaps are folded over the top minor flaps (and the bottom major flaps under the bottom minor flaps, if the case bottom is being sealed) and the case moved under rollers that apply pressure, which causes the major flaps to adhere to the minor flaps in regions where glue was applied by the glue heads. In the event the case sealing machine jams and causes the flight bar conveyor mechanism to stop or slow down to an undesirably low speed, the case sealing machine is stopped and a jam display created.",MARQ PACKAGING SYSTEMS INC,BECKETT JOEL M,MARQ PACKAGING SYSTEMS INC 3800 W.

In one embodiment of the apparatus, the air is first accumulated in a plenum (64, 68, 70) before delivery to the covering through a tube (72). In another embodiment, the apparatus has a seal (118, 130) at the opening of the boot or glove. The seal has an inlet port (126) and an exhaust port (128). The exhaust port (128) receives a flexible return air duct (122) that leads to an interior extremity of the boot or glove. The exterior portion of the exhaust ports includes risers (162) with diffusers where gloves may be mounted for drying and warning purposes. The inlet port (126) is attached to a fan device in front of a downstream heating element (132). In accordance with this invention, air is forced through the entire boot, insuring that all areas within the boot are warmed and dried.",BECKETT JOEL E,BECKETT JOEL E,,https://lens.org/015-748-659-098-97X,Search Report,yes,3,0,2,2,0,A47L23/205;;D06F59/04;;F26B21/006,A47L23/20;;D06F59/04;;F26B21/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING
