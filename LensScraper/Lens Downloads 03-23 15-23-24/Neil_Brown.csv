Estimates of single-difference between each reference station and the corresponding master station are generated and slant residuals for each reference station and satellite are calculated by using the difference between calculated single-differences and estimates. Subsequently double-differences are formed by differencing between the slant residuals for each satellite s and the slant residuals of a reference satellite k, leading to zenith residuals calculated by mapping the double-differences to a zenith value. Error values for each reference station are computed by using the zenith residuals and error values for a potential rover position are estimated by combining error values of all reference stations.

Electro-physical measurement. BISSET-BERMAN CORPORATION. Sept. 6, 1965, No.38022/65. Heading G1N. A system for measuring the conductivity of sea water in its natural location comprises an encapsulated ""mutual inductance"" probe having two coaxial torroids magnetically and electrostatically screened, so that the coupling is completed by a loop of sea water through and around the coils. The coils may be arranged in a back-to-back circuit to provide a differential output indicative of the resistance (salinity) of the water or may be connected as a variable coupling in the feedback path of a phase shift oscillator. Temperature and pressure sensors may be mounted on the probe to provide compensating signals. Differential circuit Fig. 1. The two torridal windings T 1 , T 2 are shown linked by a loop of sea water Rw. Winding T 1 is energized from an oscillator 10 which also provides a signal through two ratio transformers 12, 14 and temperature compensating network 16. The difference between this signal and the output from T 2 is detected by a synchronous detector such as that illustrated in Fig. 3 (not shown). In use the system is balanced by ratio transformer 14 to give a null reading with a liquid of known conductivity; it is then rebalanced by ratio transformer 12 using the sample liquid. The transformers 12, 14, are provided with decade dials, and may each be arranged as illustrated in Fig.2 (not shown). Compensation circuits. Temperature compensation may be provided by a platinum resistance thermometer R T in a bridge circuit Fig. 5 (not shown). A closer approximation to the temperature coefficient of sea water is given by a double bridge circuit with two platinum resistance elements Fig. 6 (not shown). A further refinement is the addition of a thermistor in the link between the two bridge circuits. Pressure compensation may be provided by a pressure responsive device actuating a potentiometer in an R. C. network including a temperature responsive resistor to provide temperature compensation for the pressure responsive signal. Phase shift oscillator arrangements. As described with reference to Figs. 9, 10 (not shown) an R. C. phase shift network is connected in a loop between two amplifiers and the loop is completed through the probe, with a quadrature voltage added to the probe output signal. In this arrangement the double-bridge-temperature-compensating- circuit is connected between auxiliary coils on the probe torroids. In Fig. 10, the pressure compensation signal is also shown injected in series with the probe output. Measurement may be made in terms of frequency variation or by adjusting a coupling resistor 510 between the auxiliary coils to null the frequency shift.",BISSETT BERMAN CORP,BROWN NEIL LEWIS,,https://lens.org/055-825-841-515-685,Granted Patent,no,0,8,1,1,0,G01N27/025,G01N27/02,G1N NAHC          AHC;;G1N NBMJ          BMJ;;G1N N1A3A         EO;;G1N N1D13         EO;;G1N N1D8          EO;;G1N N1F           EO;;G1N N19B2F        BMJ;;G1N N19D12A       BMJ;;G1N N19D12A0      BMJ;;G1N N19F1A        BMJ;;G1N N19X1         BMJ;;G1N N19X7         BMJ;;G1N N25B          BMJ;;G1N N25D3         BMJ;;G1N N25E1         BMJ;;G1N N3S1A         EO;;G1N N7A1          EO;;G1N N7C           EO;;G1U UJC1          UJC1,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Process for preparing boehmite. <??>2.1 To date, boehmite for the use in glass, catalyst and ceramics industry has been prepared by digesting ground aluminium trihydroxide in water at elevated temperatures and pressure in the presence of mineral acid. It is now intended to dispense with the initial step of grinding aluminium trihydroxide and the autoclave treatment. <??>2.2 The present invention allows a process for converting inexpensive coarse particles of aluminium trihydroxide into finely-particulate boehmite particles, during which process the aluminium hydroxide particles are first heated at a temperature of at least 300 DEG C so as to embed boehmite into a matrix of chi-aluminate. The boehmite product is then separated by dissolving the chi-aluminate, giving boehmite particles of a specific surface area which is greater than that of customary particles of 1 - 2  mu m particle size. <??>2.3 The field of application is the preparation of boehmite for the glass, catalyst and ceramics industries. <??>3.

In Fig. 2 a thermistor or platinum thermometer 180 is in the first bridge 174, and may be used for measuring the temperature of sea water. A variable resistor 192 is adjusted so that the bridge 174 is balanced at one end of the range to be measured, e.g. 0‹C. The second bridge 194 has reactive components 212, 216 (one of which may be omitted) to provide a constant phase-shift, with a variable resistor 208 so that a definite frequency of oscillation occurs at a predetermined temperature.

Process for preparing boehmite. <??>2.1 To date, boehmite for the use in glass, catalyst and ceramics industry has been prepared by digesting ground aluminium trihydroxide in water at elevated temperatures and pressure in the presence of mineral acid. It is now intended to dispense with the initial step of grinding aluminium trihydroxide and the autoclave treatment. <??>2.2 The present invention allows a process for converting inexpensive coarse particles of aluminium trihydroxide into finely-particulate boehmite particles, during which process the aluminium hydroxide particles are first heated at a temperature of at least 300 DEG C so as to embed boehmite into a matrix of chi-aluminate. The boehmite product is then separated by dissolving the chi-aluminate, giving boehmite particles of a specific surface area which is greater than that of customary particles of 1 - 2  mu m particle size. <??>2.3 The field of application is the preparation of boehmite for the glass, catalyst and ceramics industries. <??>3.

Process for preparing boehmite. <??>2.1 To date, boehmite for the use in glass, catalyst and ceramics industry has been prepared by digesting ground aluminium trihydroxide in water at elevated temperatures and pressure in the presence of mineral acid. It is now intended to dispense with the initial step of grinding aluminium trihydroxide and the autoclave treatment. <??>2.2 The present invention allows a process for converting inexpensive coarse particles of aluminium trihydroxide into finely-particulate boehmite particles, during which process the aluminium hydroxide particles are first heated at a temperature of at least 300 DEG C so as to embed boehmite into a matrix of chi-aluminate. The boehmite product is then separated by dissolving the chi-aluminate, giving boehmite particles of a specific surface area which is greater than that of customary particles of 1 - 2  mu m particle size. <??>2.3 The field of application is the preparation of boehmite for the glass, catalyst and ceramics industries. <??>3.

The rotor (10) has two discs (12 and 13) mounted on a common rotor shaft (14), one on either side of the stator (11) which carries field windings. Each rotor disc (12, 13) has two permanent magnets (21, 22) diametrically opposite one another on its face (23, 26) adjacent the stator (11) and two pole pieces (24, 25) of non-magnetised ferromagnetic material diametrically opposite one another on the same face (23, 26) of the rotar disc (12, 13). Each pole piece (24, 25) is between the two magnets (21, 22) on the same face (23, 26). Each magnet (21, 22) is axially aligned with a respective one of the pole pieces (24, 25) on the other rotor disc (12, 13) so that the magnets (21, 22) on one rotor disc (12, 13) are offset with respect to the magnets (21, 22) on the other rotor disc (12, 13). The polarity of the magnets (21, 22) on each rotor disc (12, 13) is the opposite of that of the magnets (21, 22) on the other rotor disc (12, 13).

A primary agent is used to monitor for changes, create synchronization plans to synchronized changes, and execute the synchronization plan. The primary agent, however, interacts with one or more separate custom agents to customize the synchronization plans. One exemplary technique involves monitoring for local changes to a first copy of a file tree and updates from another computing device regarding remote changes to a second copy of the file tree. When a change to either copy is identified, a synchronization plan for the change is created based on a default synchronization procedure. The synchronization plan is sent to a custom agent for customization. The custom agent creates the custom synchronization plan by modifying the synchronization plan and sends the custom synchronization plan to the primary agent.

A method for reducing the number of particles or eliminating them in a local gaseous medium in a suspension state, during surgical procedures and/or upon completion thereof is implemented by means of a device. A device for reducing the number of particles or eliminating them comprises two electrodes, each of which is electrically connected or can be electrically connected to opposite poles of high-voltage DC power supply. The first electrode can be attached to the patient's body. An electrically conducting rod of the second electrode extends through an elongated isolation envelope and has an open distal end. The rod and the second electrode respectively are designed for the removable insertion at a place or within the surgical procedure so that when using these two electrodes connected to the opposite poles of the high-voltage DC power supply, ionise the above suspended particles to be drawn to the patient. That is combined with preparing the high-voltage DC power supply. The patient's body is electrically connected to one of the poles of the above source, with using the first electrode. The second electrode is electrically connected to the other pole of the above source. The above second electrode is inserted into a gaseous medium for ionising the above suspended particles and drawing these particles to the patient.EFFECT: using the group of inventions enables reducing the number of particles found in the local gaseous medium in the suspended state and formed as a result of the surgical procedure.12 cl, 10 dwg",ASALUS MEDICAL INSTR LTD,WARREN NEIL;;CROSSLEY ROBIN;;BROWN STEVEN;;CHEER ANDREW,,https://lens.org/057-307-883-151-464,Granted Patent,no,0,0,34,34,0,A61B18/00;;A61B18/00;;A61N1/20;;A61N1/20;;A61B18/00;;A61B18/00;;A61B18/02;;A61B18/02;;A61B18/1445;;A61B18/1445;;A61B18/20;;A61B18/20;;A61B2017/320069;;A61B2017/320069;;A61B2018/00083;;A61B2018/00083;;A61B2018/00601;;A61B2018/00601;;A61B2018/1497;;A61B2018/1497;;A61B2218/008;;A61B2218/008;;A61L9/22;;A61N1/20;;B03C3/00;;B03C3/34;;B03C3/383;;B03C3/383;;B03C3/41;;B03C3/41;;B03C3/41;;B03C3/41;;B03C3/45;;B03C3/45;;B03C2201/10;;B03C2201/10;;B03C2201/26;;B03C2201/26;;B03C2201/26;;H01T19/04,A61B18/00;;A61L9/22;;B03C3/41;;B03C3/45;;H01T19/04,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
