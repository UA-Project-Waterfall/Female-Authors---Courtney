In this, as in other forms of the invention, the explosive 50 (here shown in the form of tubular explosive elements 59a,59b) surrounds a cavity 57, which is symmetrical about an axis, and the mouth of which has a cross-sectional area about the same or greater than the area of any other cross-section perpendicular to the axis.

In other embodiments (Figs. 2,9,10,10A not shown) the device is formed from an integral mass of explosive. In a device for rock blasting, Fig. 7, a cavity shaping device 60 is placed upon a boulder 61 and a sausage- shaped package of explosive 62 is cut into two portions to expose a face of explosive which is slapped over the cavity shaping device and onto the boulder. <IMAGE>",DU PONT CANADA,CASEY KENNETH,,https://lens.org/190-457-593-551-588,Patent Application,no,14,1,6,6,0,F42B1/00;;F42B3/00,F42B1/00;;F42B3/00,B3W W70A          W70A;;F3A AC1A3         AC,2,0,,,"CANADA 973 756 (GRIFFITHS)CANADA 759 252 (COOK.);;BLASTERS HANDBOOK, 15TH EDITION, PP 197-199, E.I.DU PONT DE NEMOURS & CO (INC.).",EXPIRED

An elongated, rigid piston fitted within each sleeve is controlled by a rigid rod which extends downwardly from a top-mounted crank assembly. The crank is driven by a motor actuated by a user-programmable timer circuit. When the motor is actuated the crank assembly rotates and raises the pistons, and water flows through the vent orifices, the output orifices, to be channeled onto the subfloor of the hoghouses. The force of inflowing water is effective to clear animal wastes from the hog house floor in a single flushing cycle. When the flushing cycle is complete, the timer is actuated to lower the crank assembly, so that the pistons come to rest within the guide sleeves.

    A process for the purification of water includes the addition of hydrogen peroxide and metallic coagulants in order to remove organic contaminants. Metallic coagulants increase the oxidative activity of hydrogen peroxide, while also causing the oxidized by-products to coagulate. The method is suitable for use in existing water treatment facilities. Optionally, an anionic polymer may also be added to enhance coagulation of the oxidized contaminants.

   An all electric air conditioning system for an aircraft, wherein the aircraft defines an interior volume having conditioned air at a first pressure. A compressor is provided and is operable to compress supply air to a second pressure. The compressor being operated in response to an electrical drive motor. A passage fluidly couples the compressor and the interior volume of the aircraft. A heat dissipating device, such as a heat exchanger, is positioned in the passage to extract heat energy from the supply air. This arrangement permits conditioning of air within the aircraft without using bleed air from the engines. The use of bleed air results in a significant amount of fuel burn. An optional conditioned air recovery system may be coupled to the interior volume of the fuselage to direct at least a portion of the conditioned air from the interior volume back for further conditioning and use.

A compressor (12) is provided and is operable to compress supply air to a second pressure. The compressor (12) being operated in response to an electrical drive motor (66). A passage fluidly couples the compressor and the interior volume of the aircraft. A heat dissipating device, such as a heat exchanger (20), is positioned in the passage to extract heat energy from the supply air. This arrangement permits conditioning of air within the aircraft without using bleed air from the engines. The use of bleed air results in a significant amount of fuel burn. An optional conditioned air recovery system may be coupled to the interior volume of the fuselage to direct at least a portion of the conditioned air from the interior volume back for further conditioning and use.",BOEING CO,ASFIA JULIE F;;ATKEY WARREN A;;WILLIAMS KENNETH R;;FILTERMAN CHARLES J;;LOKUSA STEVEN M;;CASEY NG Y,,https://lens.org/120-198-226-544-914,Patent Application,yes,0,6,4,4,0,B64D13/06;;B64D13/06;;B64D2013/0644;;B64D2013/0644;;B64D2013/0685;;B64D2013/0685;;B64D2013/0688;;B64D2013/0688;;Y02T50/40;;Y02T50/40;;Y02T50/50;;Y02T50/50,B64D13/06,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   An apparatus and method are provided for removing contaminate particulate matter from substrate surfaces such as semiconductor wafers. The method and apparatus use a material, preferably a liquid curable polymer, which is applied as a sacrificial coating to the surface of a substrate containing contaminate particulate matter thereon. An energy source is used to dislodge the contaminate particulate matter from the surface of the wafer into the sacrificial coating so that the particles are partially or fully encapsulated and suspended in the sacrificial coating. The sacrificial coating is then removed. The coating is preferably formed into a film to facilitate removal of the coating by pulling (stripping) the film providing a cleaner substrate surface.

    An apparatus and method are provided for removing contaminate particulate matter from substrate surfaces such as semiconductor wafers. The method and apparatus use a material, preferably a liquid curable polymer, which is applied as a sacrificial coating to the surface of a substrate containing contaminate particulate matter thereon. An energy source is used to dislodge the contaminate particulate matter from the surface of the wafer into the sacrificial coating so that the particles are partially or fully encapsulated and suspended in the sacrificial coating. The sacrificial coating is then removed. The coating is preferably formed into a film to facilitate removal of the coating by pulling (stripping) the film providing a cleaner substrate surface.

The first emission sequence may be compared to the first reflected sequence, and, based on the comparison, a sequence of variations may be determined. The sequence of variations may be compared to signal pattern stored in a sleep profile for the subject. The subject may be determined to have exhibited sleep behavior based on the comparison of the sequence of variations to the signal pattern stored in the sleep profile. In response to determining the subject has exhibited sleep behavior, the device may capture a second reflected sequence of radiation reflected from the subject.

In general, the stabilized substrate composition comprises an admixture of a binder and an aerosol forming material which plasticizes the binder, together with optional fillers and/or base materials. In the stabilized substrate compositions of the present invention the relative amounts of binder and aerosol former depend particularly on the situation in which the substrate composition is used. In general, the ratio of aerosol former to binder is between about 3:1 and about 40:1. When the stabilized composition is used on a base material such as tobacco cut filler, the ratio of aerosol former to binder should be at least about 15:1, and preferably is from about 25-35:1, with a maximum ratio of about 40:1. If the composition is formed into a cast sheet, the minimum ratio is about 3:1, the preferred ratio is about 8:1, and the maximum ratio is about 10:1. When the stabilized mixture is printed on a sheet or web substrate, the ratio of aerosol former to binder is generally about 6:1, the maximum ratio is about 10:1, and the minimum ratio is about 3:1.",REYNOLDS TOBACCO CO R,CASEY WILLIAM JAMES III;;GENTRY JEFFRY SCOTT;;GONZALEZ-PARRA ALVARO;;LEKWAUWA AJU NMAH BROOKWOOD DR;;RIGGS DENNIS MICHAEL;;SHELAR GARY ROGER;;SWICEGOOD KENNETH WAYNE;;WAGONER RONALD ODELL;;WILLIS JEFFREY ALLEN;;YOUNG WALTER RICHARD DOUGLAS J,,https://lens.org/133-410-688-115-281,Patent Application,yes,0,53,44,113,0,A24B15/14;;A24B15/165;;A24B15/28;;A24B15/287;;A24D1/22;;A24B15/10;;A24B15/14;;A24B15/287;;A24B15/28;;A24B15/165;;A24D1/22,A24B3/00;;A24B15/28;;A24B15/14;;A24D1/02;;A24D1/18;;A24D1/22;;A61K9/72;;C09K3/30,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
