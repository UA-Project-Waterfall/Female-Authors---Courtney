    A method and apparatus for monitoring the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of a noisy data signal in an optical communication system. In a receiver, input of a noisy data signal to a limiting amplifier results in a regenerated data signal. The regenerated data signal is compared to the noisy data signal and the difference signal is assumed to be, for the most part, noise. A measure of the amplitude of the regenerated data signal is divided by a measure of the energy of the difference signal to result in an indication of the SNR of the noisy data signal.

As disclosed herein, a reflector for such a device is constructed of a substrate with a reflective coating, for example painted onto one or more surfaces of the substrate. The coating material comprises a zinc oxide pigment, preferably an uncalcined zinc oxide together with a small amount of a dispersing agent. The pigment and water are mixed together with an alkali metal silicate vehicle-binder (preferably a potassium silicate), for example, in a sheer mixer. The resulting material can be painted onto the desired surface, for example by spraying, spot-brushing or dipping.

   An apparatus and method is disclosed for attaching a data sub-channel to a digital payload data stream having a clock signal for communicating supplemental data within an optical communications network. At an upstream site the clock signal is phase-modulated with an encoded supplemental data stream to generate a phase-modulated sub-channel. The phase-modulated clock is used to time the payload data stream so as to superimpose the phase-modulated sub-channel onto the payload data stream. At a downstream site the sub-channel is recovered and the clock signal is used to retime the payload data stream. The sub-channel is then demodulated and the supplemental data stream decoded.

   The present invention provides a method and apparatus for delivering digital media using packetized encryption data. According to the present invention, a client computing device initiates a session with the server via a computer network and requests a digital media stream. In response, the server authenticates the users and delivers the digital media stream using one or more security processes. In one embodiment, the security process is encryption which is used during the transmission of the digital media from the server to the client. The encryption ensures that the digital stream is protected from copying. In one embodiment, a secure delivery protocol is used wherein a configurable key exchange between the client and the server occurs simultaneous with the delivery of the actual data. As part of the key exchange, encapsulated packets maybe sent between the client and the server, wherein the encapsulated packet contains a header and a payload. The payload contains fragments of the actual digital media that is being used (i.e., movie, song, television program, etc.) The header contains the configurable and rolling encryption key that is sent to the client.

The different tags appended to the sample nucleic acids from each sample population unique. These different tags are used to generate RNA or DNA , molecules for analysis that derive form each of the input samples. The disclosed methods are primarily intended to enhance gene array analysis, however, any method used to compare multiple nucleic acid targets form different samples will benefit form the invention.",AMBION INC;;BROWN DAVID;;WINKLER MATTHEW M,BROWN DAVID;;WINKLER MATTHEW M,,https://lens.org/076-779-415-889-681,Search Report,yes,3,0,3,12,25,C12Q1/6809,C12Q1/68;;C12Q1/6809,,1,0,,,"ZIMMERMANN K ET AL: ""TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF QUANTITATIVE COMPETITIVE PCR"", BIOTECHNIQUES, EATON PUBLISHING, NATICK, US, vol. 21, no. 2, 1 August 1996 (1996-08-01), pages 268 - 270,272,27, XP000597689, ISSN: 0736-6205",PENDING

   Disclosed are methods that allow one or more targets to be compared across two or more nucleic acid populations. The methods rely on first mixing sample populations that are being compared. The sample mixture is then divided into target fractions using hybridization to polynucleotides or oligonucleotides that can be separated from the sample mixture. The target fraction(s) are independently amplified such that the targets from each sample compete for amplification reagents. The amplification products are quantified in a manner that differentiates the sample from which a particular amplification product arose. The relative abundance of amplification products descended from each sample population reflects the level of target present in each of the original samples, providing a direct comparison of the abundance of the target sequences in the samples being characterized.

Davies, A. E., and Brown, F. M. April 6, 1918. Order apparatus; mine signalling systems. - An electrically-operated signalling device for use in connexion with colliery winding engines comprises a magnet 1 and a solenoid 2 both in the same circuit which is closed by a switch 4 operated by hand or by the pull rope. A pointer 8 is loosely mounted on a fixed axle 11 and is connected to a ratchet wheel 7 provided with a stop 9 and spring controlled so as normally to bring the stop 9 against a stop 10 on the axle 11. A second solenoid 13 has a core 15 which, when the ratchet wheel 7 is moved by a pawl 6 on a lever 5 attracted by the magnet 1, falls in between the stops 9, 10, and prevents the pointer 8 returning to zero till the solenoid 13 is excited by the closing of its circuit by starting of the engine or by hand. The solenoid 2 has a cross-bar 18 on its plunger 17 which is controlled in its fall by a dash-pot 21. A projection 23 on the cross-bar 18 trips a lever 24 when rising and lifts a retaining pawl 26, and by a pin 27 thereon also the actuating pawl 6, clear of the wheel 7, thus allowing the pointer to fall back to the No. 1 indication. The parts are designed so that, on closing the switch 4, the wheel 7 is moved one tooth before the projection 23 rises to lift the pawls 6, 26, and when this occurs immediately afterwards the core 15 has already fallen to prevent return of the wheel 7 and pointer 8 to zero. Subsequent closings of the switch 4 belonging to the same signal will take place before the projection 23 has time to fall below the trip lever 24, and so are recorded. In the event of the signal not being answered, sufficient time will have elapsed before it is considered necessary to repeat the signal for the projection 23 to fall below the lever 24, and on making the first contact of the repetition the pointer will be released to fall back to the No. 1 position and subsequent contacts will be added on as before. Starting of the engine, or otherwise, excites the solenoid 13 and raises the core 15 and with it a hooked &c. rod 28 which lifts the pawls 6, 26, so allowing the pointer to return to zero.

A database capable of keeping track of users and their corresponding access privileges within the system is employed to monitor user activity. Ultimately, through the use of a software component delivered over the Internet for use within standard web browsers, end-users are able to populate templates under the constraints imposed by the rules of the manufacturers at the time of template design. These population elements which “fill in the blanks” of the pre-defined templates may be either of type IMAGE or TEXT. Image regions are populated by choosing from a subset of the entire image inventory, while TEXT types can be completely free form, with specific rules guiding justification, point size, font, and leading, or “fill in the blank” form with the same constraint rules as free form.

Wight, W. D., and Wild, M. B. May 27. Valve gear; valves, expansion.-Relates to improvements in the type of valves and valve gear described in Specification No. 12,496, A.D. 1895. In that gear the cut-off or expansion slides are actuated from the spindle of the main valve through the medium of trip or clip gear, which releases the valve and allows it to close under the influence of steam pressure, or of a spring, at a point in the stroke determined by the engine governor. Fig. 2 shows a sectional plan through the valve-chest at one end of the cylinder C, and Fig. 1 a side elevation of the same. P is the admission passage, O<c> the exhaust outlet, and B a balance plate at the back of the main valve. Instead of the trip gear being arranged between the main and cut-off valve spindles, it is according to the present invention arranged upon the m a i n spindle. As before, it consists of a toggle joint f, e for each cut-off valve q, which, when straight, causes the main and cut-off valves to move together. But the toggles are in this invention pushed out of the straight so as to permit the cut-off valves to close by means of tails n, n<1>, which come in contact with certain stops at o, o' adjusted in position by the governor. The opening of the cut-off valves is effected by stops l, l. The toggle-joints may be arranged together, or they may be separated and disposed at opposite ends of the cylinder. The cut-off valve q is made so as to open several ports simultaneously on the admission side of the main valve.",WIGHT WILLIAM DUNDAS;;WILD MATTHEW BROWN,WIGHT WILLIAM DUNDAS;;WILD MATTHEW BROWN,,https://lens.org/122-181-970-012-408,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   An exciter ring assembly to detect rotational parameters of an axle within a tube has an exciter ring attached to the axle by an elastomer insert. The insert provides a frictional interference fit with the axle. The insert affixes the exciter ring to rotate with the axle. The elastomer insert is supplied with radially-spaced axial channels to enable oil flow past the assembly. The outer member of the assembly is press fit into the axle tube. The outer member remains stationary with respect to the axle tube. The outer member restricts the axial movement of the exciter ring and enables rotation of the exciter ring and provides oil flow across the exciter ring assembly.

The cavity has a diffusively reflective interior surface and an aperture (17) for allowing emission of combined light. Control of the intensity of emission of the sources sets the amount of primary color light of each wavelength added to the substantially white input light output and thus determines a spectral characteristic of the white light output through the aperture. A variety of different elements may optically process the combined light output, such a deflector, a variable iris, and a lens a variable focusing lenses system, a collimator, a holographic diffuser and combinations thereof.",ADVANCED OPTICAL TECH INC,RAINS JACK C JR;;BROWN MATTHEW,,https://lens.org/041-532-077-654-710,Granted Patent,no,0,0,37,64,0,F21S2/00;;F21S8/00;;F21S10/02;;F21V5/002;;F21V5/008;;F21V11/10;;F21V14/06;;F21W2131/406;;F21Y2113/00;;G01J1/08;;G01J3/0254;;G01J3/0264;;G01J3/10;;G01J3/501;;G02B5/0252;;G02B5/0278;;G02B5/0284;;G02B6/0008;;G03B15/06;;G09F13/0404;;G09F13/06;;G09F13/14;;G09F13/22;;H05B35/00;;Y10S362/80;;Y10S362/812;;F21V2200/13;;F21Y2115/10;;F21Y2113/13;;F21Y2113/20;;H05B45/20;;H05B45/395;;H05B45/22;;H05B45/00;;F21V7/28;;F21V7/24;;Y02B20/30;;H05B45/28;;F21S10/02;;G09F13/22;;G01J3/0254;;G01J3/10;;G01J1/08;;G09F13/06;;G01J3/501;;G03B15/06;;G01J3/0264;;G02B5/0278;;F21V5/002;;F21S2/00;;F21Y2113/00;;F21V14/06;;F21W2131/406;;F21V11/10;;F21S8/00;;G02B5/0284;;F21V5/008;;G09F13/14;;G02B6/0008;;G02B5/0252;;G09F13/0404;;H05B35/00;;F21V2200/13;;Y10S362/80;;Y10S362/812;;F21Y2115/10;;F21Y2113/13;;F21Y2113/20;;H05B45/00;;H05B45/20;;H05B45/22;;H05B45/395;;F21V7/24;;F21V7/28;;Y02B20/30;;H05B45/28,F21V13/00;;B25B13/14;;B25B23/00;;B25B23/18;;F21S8/02;;F21V5/04;;F21V7/04;;F21V7/22;;F21V14/06;;F21Y101/00;;F21Y113/20;;G01J1/00;;G01J3/10;;G05D25/02;;H01L31/00;;H05B37/02;;H05B44/00,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

Predictor variables may include temperature, humidity, windspeed or direction, occupancy, time, day, date, and solar radiation. Scaling factor values may be defined by optimization training using historical building energy load values and measured predictor variable values for a building. Predicted and measured building energy load values are compared to determine if a preset difference threshold has been exceeded, in which case an alert signal or message is generated and transmitted to electronically and/or physically signal a user.

The sector is then formatted or erased and the valid data is returned to the flash device at the next available free space contiguously. A pointer is updated to keep track of the location of the next available recently formatted free space on the flash device. The process is then repeated on each consecutive sector on the flash memory device until all valid data becomes contiguous on one contiguous segment of the device and all free space becomes contiguous on a second contiguous segment of the device. In this manner, the flash memory is defragmented and the largest possible contiguous file can be written to the device. Files can be saved on the flash memory device in contiguous file formats and blocked file formats. During the reclamation and defragmentation routine, the file format of the valid data is preserved.
