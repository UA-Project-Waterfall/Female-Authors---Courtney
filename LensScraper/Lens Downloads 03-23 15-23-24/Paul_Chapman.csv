As shown a switch 14 is used to select one of three frequencies at terminals 15, 16, 18 of a frequency divider 12 to drive a liquid crystal display 30. A switch 40 ganged to the switch 14 activates a corresponding one of decimal point indicators 33a-c to show that the display is in thousandths, hundredths, or tenths of a second. Counting is started and stopped by a switch 52 which controls a NOR gate 20 via logic circuitry 51. In the RESET position of the switch 52, counter 22 and the display 30 are set to zero. A further embodiment is envisaged which can also be used as a reaction timer or for starting races. In this mode, a randomly variable delay is introduced between the operation of a push-button switch (52a), Fig. 5 (not shown) and the inititation of counting. As counting starts, a transistor (94) is triggered to light a lamp (70). The next operation of the switch (52a) stops the counter, and a third operation resets to zero. If the STOP operation is performed before the end of the variable delay, a flip-flop (86) in the logic circuitry is reset to sound an alarm.

JOHNSON SERVICE CO. Dec 9,1964, No. 50074/64. Headings G3H and G3P. [Also in Divisions F1 and F2] Apparatus for measuring and controlling fluid flow comprises a toothed disc 16 rotated at a speed proportional to flow in a line 13 via a paddle wheel 12 and shaft 11. The teeth on the disc cooperate with an emitter nozzle 19 and an opposed collector nozzle 22 to produce pressure pulses in a line 23 communicating with the interior of a hollow diaphragm 27 located in a valve housing 25. The diaphragm engages one end of a lever 28 pivoted at 29, the other end of the lever carrying garter spring 31 which cooperates with the spherical head 33 of a valve stem 34 carrying a closure member 35. The closure member 35 cooperates with seats 36, 50, the latter surrounding a port connected to a line 40 leading to a bellows 41 carrying an indicator 42 and to a valve 55 in the conduit 13. A restricted leakage passage 44 from line 40 is provided. When there is no pulse in line 23, spring 30 rotates lever 28 counter clockwise to force the garter spring over head 33 to cause the valve to engage seat 50. With the valve in this position, a pressure supply in line 38 charges a small reservoir 39. When the diaphragm receives a pulse it rotates the lever to cause the valve to engage seat 36. In this position the reservoir discharges to line 40. The pressure level in line 40 is thus a function of the pulse frequency which in turn is a measure of the flow rate. In the system shown, the valve 55 controls bypass from lines 59, 60 supply ing hot water, the water being circulated by a pump 58 and heated by a unit 57. The indicator 42, 43 may be replaced by a recorder. A flow totaliser is provided at 14. In the embodiment of Fig. 2, not shown, supply line 38 is omitted, the line 40 receiving its supply via a restriction 138<SP>1</SP> from line 138. When the valve engages seat 150, the reservoir is exhausted via passage 170. The pressure level in line 140 is thus dependent on the pulse frequency i.e. the frequency with which the reservoir is discharged.",JOHNSON SERVICE CO,CHAPMAN WILLIAM PAUL;;HOLLOWAY THOMAS MARSHALL,,https://lens.org/090-243-459-039-517,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G05D11/035;;G01F1/06,G01F1/06;;G05D11/035,F1T TRX           TRX;;F1T TR1           F1E2;;F2V V13X          -;;G1R RBD           RBD;;G3H H9A           HZ1;;G3P PEAS          PEAS;;G3P PEAX          PEAX;;G3P P1B           -;;G3P P12B          -;;G3P P16C          -;;G3P P18           -;;G3P P23           -;;G3P P24F          -;;G3P P24KX         -;;G3P P25A          -;;G3P P8            -;;G3P P9AX          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

An outer layer of tipping material can overlie at least a portion of an underlying inner layer of tipping material, and during use by the smoker, the outer layer can be removed from the cigarette. Thus, it is possible for a cigarette manufacturer to provide a cigarette that can be used as such by the smoker, or that can be adapted by the smoker to provide a different sensory experience (e.g., the visual, organoleptic, trigeminal, aromatic, and tactile characteristics of the cigarette can be altered by removal of the outer tipping material).

As each repeater (103-108) receives a stream (200, 300) of paging information from the system controller (102), the repeaters (103-108) store it. When the repeater transition (208) occurs, the backup repeater (104, 106, 108) determines the paging messages (202-206 or 302) that were not transmitted during the repeater transition (208) based on the most recently stored stream (200, 300) of paging information. Subsequently, the backup repeater (104, 106, 108) transmits (402) a paging failure message to the system controller (102) indicating the paging messages (202-206 or 302) that were not transmitted. Upon receiving this, the system controller (102) commands (403) the backup repeater (104, 106, 108) to retransmit the paging messages (202-206 or 302) that were not transmitted during the repeater transition (208).",MOTOROLA INC,CHRISTIAN PAUL R;;CHAPMAN SCOTT G,,https://lens.org/117-985-177-013-520,Patent Application,yes,5,0,7,7,0,H04L1/0083;;H04W84/022;;H04W84/022;;H04L1/0083,H04B1/74;;H04L1/00;;H04W84/02,,0,0,,,,PENDING

A sensor (16) provides reflectance signals representing the intensity of light reflected from a number of sensed elements on the face of the document. A signal processing circuit responsive to the reflectance signals includes means (26) for determining for each of a number of areas of the document, the number of elements in the area which result in a signal level exceeding a first threshold, representing the upper limit of brightness for printed areas on the document; and means (24, 34, 36) for determining whether the number of elements exceeding the first threshold reaches a given proportion of the total number of sensed elements for that area. Each area is then given a brightness value dependent on the relationship between a second threshold, representing the upper limit of brightness for unprinted areas having an excessive degree of soiling, and those signal levels of the elements of the area which exceed the first threshold. The fitness or unfitness of the document is judged from the brightness values of all such areas. In another form of apparatus embodying the invention, a first comparator compares the level of the signal from the sensor with a first threshold and the signal is integrated only over periods in which its level exceeds this first threshold. The resulting signal represents the total reflectance of the brighter areas of the face of the document. A further signal is obtained representing the total time that the reflectance signal level exceeds the first threshold and this duration signal and the total reflectance signal are used in combination to provide the ""fit"" or ""unfit"" output signal for the document.",DE LA RUE SYST,CHAPMAN VICTOR BRIAN;;LACEY PAUL DENNIS,,https://lens.org/061-627-492-590-301,Patent Application,yes,8,0,8,8,0,G07D7/12;;G07D7/187;;G07D7/12;;G07D7/187,G01N21/892;;G01N21/89;;G07D7/00;;G07D7/12;;G07D7/182,G1A AA9           MBX;;G1A AC1           MBX;;G1A AC12          MBX;;G1A AC3           MBX;;G1A AC4           MBX;;G1A AC8           MBX;;G1A AD1           MBX;;G1A AD6           MBX;;G1A AG1           MBX;;G1A AG2           MBX;;G1A AG6           MBX;;G1A AG9           MBX;;G1A AMB           MBX;;G1A AMBX          MBX;;G1A AP10          MBX;;G1A AR7           MBX;;G1A AT14          MBX;;G1A AT21          MBX;;G1A AT3           MBX;;G1A AT4           MBX;;G1A AT8           MBX;;G1A AT9           MBX;;U1S S2272,0,0,,,,PATENTED

Un senseur (16) fournit des signaux de facteur de réflexion qui représentent l'intensité de la lumière réfléchie par un certain nombre d'éléments explorés sur la face du document. Un circuit de traitment de signaux sensible aux signaux de facteur de réflexion comprend un dispositif (26) pour déterminer, pour chaque zone du document, le nombre d'éléments dans la zone qui produisent un niveau de signaux supérieur à un premier seuil, représentant la limite supérieure de luminosité admise pour les zones imprimées du document; et dispositif (24, 34, 36) pour déterminer si le nombre d'éléments supérieurs au premier seuil atteint une proportion donnée du nombre total d'éléments explorés de cette zone. Chaque zone reçoit ensuite une valeur de luminosité fonction de la relation entre un deuxième seuil, représentant la limite supérieure de luminosité pour les zones non-imprimées et excessivement souillées, et ces niveaux des signaux des éléments de la zone qui dépassent le premier seuil. La vadilité ou l'invadilité du document est déterminée sur la base des valeurs de la luminosité de toutes ces zones. Dans un autre mode de réalisation de l'invention, un premier comparateur compare le niveau du signal du senseur avec un premier seuil, le signal n'étant intégré que pendant des périodes où son niveau dépasse ce premier seuil. Le signal résultant représente le facteur de réflexion totale des zones plus lumineuses de la face du document. Un signal supplémentaire obtenu représente le temps total pendant lequel le niveau du signal du facteur de réflexion dépasse le premier seuil. Ce signal de durée et le signal du facteur de réflexion totale sont combinés afin de fournir le signal de sortie ""valide"" ou ""invalide"" pour le document.",DE LA RUE SYST,CHAPMAN VICTOR BRIAN;;LACEY PAUL DENNIS,,https://lens.org/171-290-586-776-411,Patent Application,yes,0,0,8,8,0,G07D7/12;;G07D7/187;;G07D7/12;;G07D7/187,G01N21/89;;G01N21/892;;G07D7/00;;G07D7/12;;G07D7/182,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Each MiM capacitor comprises an interconnection layer ( 10,10 ′) of the CMOS process as one plate and a thinner conductive layer ( 11,11 ′) as the second plate, with an insulating layer ( 20,20 ′) disposed therebetween. This allows each MiM capacitor to be formed between two CMOS process interconnection layers. The second plate of the second MiM capacitor is substantially co-extensive with the second plate of the first MiM capacitor, and is disposed substantially directly over the second plate of the first MiM capacitor. The same mask may be used to pattern the second plate of the second MiM capacitor and the second plate of the first MiM capacitor.

    A hose dispenser has a rotatable reel 10,  holding a coiled hose 12  suitable for conveying breathable gas, mounted on a tubular steel frame 14.  The reel has a pivoting arm 16,  which has a portion defining an aperture, or eye 18  fitted thereon. The hose is threaded through the eye 16  so that the free end of the hose protrudes through the eye. The free end of the hose is fitted with a resilient frusto-conical protective hood 20.  The hood provides two functions. First, it enables the free end of the hose to engage the eye of the arm 16,  and secondly, it protects a valve 22,  located on the free end of the hose, from damage. Another valve 24  is provided in the centre of the reel, which is connected to the other end of the hose. In use, the free end of the hose is carried by an operative, or is attached to breathing apparatus worn by the operative, and the other end is connected to a source containing gas for breathing. 

    The arm 16  is mounted pivotally on the reel. Due to the fact that the hose is threaded through the aperture portion mounted on the arm, when the hose is put under tension, i.e. when the end of the hose is pulled so as to uncoil the hose, the arm lifts. If the hose becomes slack, i.e. when it is not being pulled, the arm falls under gravity. 

    The pivoting arm 16  is operatively connected to braking means which provides a brake for the reel 10  holding the hose. When the brake is engaged rotational motion of the reel is inhibited, thus preventing undesirably large amounts of hose from being dispensed from the reel 10  when the hose is slack.

The reel has a pivoting arm 16 , which has a portion defining an aperture, or “eye” 18 fitted thereon. The hose is threaded through the eye 16 so that the free end of the hose protrudes through the eye. The free end of the hose is fitted with a resilient frusto-conical protective hood 20 . The hood provides two functions. First, it enables the free end of the hose to engage the eye of the arm 16 , and secondly, it protects a valve 22 , located on the free end of the hose, from damage. Another valve 24 is provided in the centre of the reel, which is connected to the other end of the hose. In use, the free end of the hose is carried by an operative, or is attached to breathing apparatus worn by the operative, and the other end is connected to a source containing gas for breathing. The arm 16 is mounted pivotally on the reel. Due to the fact that the hose is threaded through the aperture portion mounted on the arm, when the hose is put under tension, i.e. when the end of the hose is pulled so as to uncoil the hose, the arm lifts.

The pivoting arm 16 is operatively connected to braking means which provides a brake for the reel 10 holding the hose.

   The present invention is a piece of exercise equipment designed to train and condition sport-specific muscle groups used during a swinging motion, as in golf. It is comprised of a mechanical linkage, with at least six free-moving joints, so that it effectively simulates a wide variety of golf swings without the need for complex adjustments and provides for smooth and even distribution of resistance to the various muscle groups involved in the swinging motion. It includes a resistance mechanism, such as a pulley system linked to two one-way hydraulic cylinders. This allows a user to simultaneously practice swing form and technique while also strengthening and conditioning the specific muscles needed for the sport.

    This invention relates to the quantitative determination of a target or volume in the living body relative to external apparatus based on CT (computer tomography) or other image data. The invention describes a means of taking CT image data of the anatomy and of natural or implanted index positions on the patient's body, and relating the CT data to a coordinate system related to external apparatus which may be in fixed position relative to the patient. One implementation uses a transformation between the CT image data coordinate system and the second coordinate system. This makes it possible to do frame-based or frameless stereotactic target identification and approaches without the need for attaching a frame to the patient at the time of CT scanning.

More specifically, the application comprises code entities such as components, packages, libraries, or microservices. The entities are modified as part of the application development process to have an enabled state, in which these entities are permitted to run normally when called, and a disabled state, in which these entities do not run when called but instead perform a back-out behavior such as generating an error message. At runtime, the application periodically accesses a security vulnerabilities database to check for security alerts. When a relevant security alert is found, the application changes any code entities that are affected by the security alert to the disabled state pending investigation by an operations team.

More specifically, the application comprises code entities such as components, packages, libraries, or microservices. The entities are modified as part of the application development process to have an enabled state, in which these entities are permitted to run normally when called, and a disabled state, in which these entities do not run when called but instead perform a back-out behavior such as generating an error message.

The N may be attached to the same or different substituted or unsubstituted aromatic hydrocarbon radicals, e.g. phenyl, mono-, di-, or tri-alkyl phenyl where each alkyl contains 1-8 C atoms, benzyl phenyl alkyl substituted benzyl-phenyl, or halogen substituted radicals such as chlorphenyl or benzyl chlorphenyl. The polyethers may be the reaction products of 1:2 alkylene, e.g. ethylene, butylene, or propylene, or mixtures, oxides with compounds containing at least two primary or secondary aromatic amino groups or one primary and one tertiary aromatic amino group e.g. o-, m-, or p-phenylene diamine, 2:4- and 2:6-diaminotoluene, 4:41 diaminodiphenylmethane and other aniline-formaldehyde reaction products 4-aminodiphenylamine, N:N-diethyl-p-phenylene diamine, 2:4:6-triaminotoluene, 2:4:41-triamino diphenylmethane, and 4:41 diaminodiphenylamine, or mixtures. From 1 to 10 mol. proportions alkylene oxide for each equivalent proportion of H in the amino groups are used at 70-130 DEG C. and 0-50 p.s.i.g. to form polyethers of average mol. wt. 350-1200. The reaction is in aqueous or alcoholic solution in the presence of KOH and water or alcohol is subsequently distilled off. Where KOH is used the reaction mixture is neutralised by acid, e.g. glacial acetic or CO2, and the formed salt filtered. The reaction may be effected in stages with the same or different alkylene oxide, e.g. mono-, di-, tri-, or tetrab -hydroxyl ethyl-2:4-diaminotoluene may be the intermediate, which is further reacted, Isocyanates are hexamethylene diisocyanate. tolylene-2:4-, tolylene-2:6-, diphenyl methane-4:41-, 3 methyldiphenylmethane-4:41-, m- and p-phenylene-, chlorophenylene-2:4-, naphthalene-1:5-, diphenyl-4:41-diisocyanates, 4:41-diisocyanato-3:31-dimethyldiphenyl, diphenyl ether diisocyanate, dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate, 2:4:6-triisocyanatotoluene, 2:4:41-triisocyanatodiphenyl ether, polyisocyanates obtained by reacting excess diisocyanate with trimethylol propane and uretedione dimers, isocyanurate polymers of tolylene-2:4-diisocyanate, or mixtures of polyisocyanates obtained by phosgenation of reaction products of formaldehyde with aniline or o-toluidine. The polyurethanes may be rigid or flexible, and solid or cellular form. Foamed polyurethanes are formed by reacting polyether and polyisocyanate with up to 20% water, 1-100% of low boiling (-40 to 50 DEG C.) organic liquid blowing agent may also be added, e.g. halogen substituted hydrocarbons particularly containing at least one F atom and a number are exemplified. The reaction mixture may include not more than an equal weight of polyhydric alcohols, containing 2 or more OH groups and one or more aliphatic N groups, which are listed. Exemplified tertiary amine or organo metallic catalysts may be present, as well as other listed additives. In examples: (1) a resin is prepared by stirring water, tri-(b -chloroethyl) phosphate, the reaction product of ethylene oxide and cetyl/oleyl alcohol mixture, aqueous dimethylbenzylamine lactate solution, and polyether. This polyether is prepared by reacting diaminodiphenylmethane in a pressure vessel at 100-120 DEG C. with ethylene oxide and KOH. The resin is reacted with 4:41-diisocyanatodiphenyl methane to form polyurethane. (3) A resin from oxypropylated tolylene diamine, polysiloxane-polyoxyalkylene block copolymer, and trichloromonofluoromethane is reacted with a mixture of tolylene-2:4- and 2:6-diisocyanates, and (5) dibutyl tin dilaurate catalyst may be used. (6) and (10) Oxypropylated-4:41-diaminodiphenyl methane is reacted as in (1) with, or without, triethanolamine. (13) and (15) are similar to (1) but start from oxyethylated tolylene diamine and the reaction product of ethylene oxide and octyl cresol respectively.
