Once this is achieved, the file is truncated such that the space consumed by all empty and discardable pages is returned to the file system. Truncating the file involves traversing the file backwards from the end of the file until the first non-empty page is found. The file is truncated after the last non-empty page.

   Shadow paging is a technique used to achieve atomic and durable transactions, and provides the ability to manipulate pages in a database. During a transaction, the pages affected by the transaction are copied from the database file into a workspace, such as volatile memory, and modified in that workspace. When a transaction is committed, all of the pages that were modified by the transaction are written from the workspace to unused pages in the database file. During execution of the transaction, the state of the database exposed to the user is that in which the database existed prior to the transaction, since the database file still contains the original versions of the modified pages, as they existed before being copied into the workspace. If a user accesses the database before the transaction is complete, or upon recovery of a failure, it will appear as though the transaction has not occurred.

When the transaction is committed, all the pages already changed thereby are written into unused pages of the database file. Because the database file still stores a version present before the copying to the work space, which is an original version of the changed page, during execution of the transaction, a state of the database opened to a user is a state present before the transaction. When the user accesses the database before completion of the transaction or in time of restoration from a failure, the transaction looks like non-occurrence. <P>COPYRIGHT: (C)2005,JPO&NCIPI",MICROSOFT CORP,BAILEY STEVEN J,,https://lens.org/074-957-731-416-284,Patent Application,no,0,4,10,10,0,G06F16/2365;;G06F12/16;;G06F16/2365;;Y10S707/99953,G06F12/00;;G06F12/16;;G06F17/30,,2,0,,,"CSNB200400045001, グレイ ジム, トランザクション処理 ［下］, 20011029, １版１刷, ｐ．７８７−８７０, 日経ＢＰ社 岡部 力也;;JPN6010003108, グレイ ジム, トランザクション処理 ［下］, 20011029, １版１刷, ｐ．７８７−８７０, 日経ＢＰ社 岡部 力也",INACTIVE

If a user accesses the database before the transaction is complete, or upon recovery of a failure, it will appear as though the transaction has not occurred.",MICROSOFT CORP,BAILEY STEVEN J,MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (2003-05-29),https://lens.org/187-936-310-862-90X,Granted Patent,yes,1,11,10,10,0,G06F16/2365;;G06F12/16;;G06F16/2365;;Y10S707/99953,G06F12/00;;G06F17/30;;G06F12/16,707/200;;707/202;;707/203;;707/205,11,5,040-708-594-969-024;;072-680-043-192-49X;;104-545-105-319-992;;072-680-043-192-49X;;073-803-873-780-366,10.1109/soac.1991.143840;;10.1109/32.4635;;10.1007/10721064_11;;10.1109/32.4635;;10.1145/320521.320540,"Tatu Ylonen, ""Shadow Paging Is Feasible"", 1995, pp. 1-16.;;Song et al., ""No-Log Recovery Mechanism Using Stable Memory For Real-Time Main Memory Database Systems"", 1999, pp. 428-431.;;Graefe et al., ""Data Compression and Database Performance"", 1991, pp. 1-10.;;Kent et al., ""Optimizing Shadow Recovery Algorithms"", 1988, pp. 155-157.;;Tatu Ylonen, ""Shadow Paging Is Feasible"", M.S. thesis, Helsinki University of Technology, Department of Computer Science, 1995, pp. 1-20, http://citeseer.ifi.unizh.ch/cache/papers/cs/2169/http:zSzzSzwww.cs.hut.fizSz~ylozSztechreportszSztkk-tko-tr-B123-1995.pdf/shadow-paging-is-feasible.pdf.;;Ylonen, Tatu; ""Shadow Paging is Feasible,""; 1994, Department of Computer Science, Helsinki University of Technology, pp. 1-16.;;Donsex, D. et al., ""Recoverable Persistent Memory for SmartCard"" Smart Card Research and Applications Third Intl Conference(lecture Notes in Computer Science), 2000, 1820, 134-140.;;Kim, Y.K. et al., ""Recovery in a Shared Disk Parallel Database System Using DFeRAM"", Proc.

   A b-tree having information stored therein is utilized to facilitate positional access of elements stored in the leaves of the b-tree. The b-tree is structured such that for each non-leaf level value, a count is located to its immediate left and a value is located to its immediate right. These left and right counts indicate the number of leaf level values located in the leaves of the sub-trees to the immediate left and right of the value. The left and right counts are used to determine the path to take when descending the b-tree in search of a specific position. The counts can also be utilized to determine the total number of values in the leaf level of the b-tree.

   A hexapod machine is disclosed in which six adjustable length struts couple to a controllably moveable platform at three triangularly spaced locations at each of which a pair of struts couple together and to the platform at a bifurcated universal joint. The struts extend away from the platform and through machine nodes defined at triangularly spaced-apart locations in a machine sub-frame, and at each such node a strut extending from one platform location and the next adjacent strut from the next adjacent platform location come together and cross each other in respective hemispheres of a bifurcated sphere journalled for multidirectional pivotal movement in a socket in the sub-frame. The hemispheres each contain a motor which is frictionally engaged with the respective strut so as to enable it to be driven through the hemisphere to adjust its effective length. By control of the motors, the platform position and orientation can be adjusted in space. Also disclosed is a pentapod machine in which a tripod with three adjustable legs defines the position of a first tool support, and the position of a second spaced-apart tool support is defined by two adjustable legs, a tool being supported between said two supports.

If the thrust loads build faster than the centripetal loads the Tip Speed Ratio (TSR) is reduced to increase torque and if the thrust loads reduce faster than the centripetal force the TSR is increased to conserve rotational momentum. Springs (fig 3,33,37) can establish the starting position and the rpm limit. Centripetal force can be exerted by masses 3 that swing on arms, causing a cam (fig 2, 17) to oppose the wind thrust and movement of the turbine along its rotation axis. Centripetal forces can alternatively be generated by radial movement of the blades. The system is self powered and adjusts the blade angles to have a high angle of attack when parked to promote start up: move to their ideal setting angle for normal running; responds to gusts and lulls with appropriate changes, and feathers the blades to limit the rpm and reduce loads in storm conditions.",BAILEY RALPH-PETER STEVEN,BAILEY RALPH-PETER STEVEN,,https://lens.org/038-205-559-570-994,Patent Application,no,4,0,7,7,0,F03D7/022;;F03D7/04;;F03D7/0224;;F03D7/0224;;F05B2260/77;;F05B2260/77;;Y02E10/72;;Y02E10/72,F03D7/04;;F03D7/02,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The area on the strip where the fibres are deposited is defined by an aperture in a forming screen located below, and in contact with, the strip. The air stream is a result of a suction applied below the screen. With an aperture, a uniform layer of fibre is deposited on the strip. Instead, the screen may have a forming zone which has a region of high permeability and a region of intermediate permeability, more fibre being deposited on that area of the strip in alignment with the high permeability region than that area in alignment with the intermediate permeability region. The wad is then stabilized and bonded to the carrier and a liquid impervious backing layer is secured to the strip, sandwiching the wad therebetween. The wad or that portion of the strip and backing to which it is bonded are cut out from the rest of the strip and the backing to provide a pad.",MCNEIL PPC INC,OATLEY JOHN ALBERT;;BAILEY ALAN STEVEN,,https://lens.org/093-087-988-281-218,Patent Application,yes,3,12,13,24,0,A61F13/15626;;A61F13/15634;;D04H1/72,A61F13/15;;D04H13/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In one arrangement, the vibration devices imparts a resonant wave motion to a swaging apparatus that is being pushed through a passage of a wellbore tubular.

The substrate may be exposed to living cells, such that some of the living cells become coupled to the substrate. Gas-plasma treatment parameters may be chosen such that the living cells coupled to the treated substrate produce more of a cellular product than living cells coupled to an untreated substrate.",UNIV TEXAS HEALTH SCIENCE CT A;;AGRAWAL C MAULI;;BAILEY STEVEN R;;POLAN JODIE L,AGRAWAL C MAULI;;BAILEY STEVEN R;;POLAN JODIE L,,https://lens.org/129-713-820-546-294,Search Report,yes,4,0,6,6,0,A61L27/3804;;A61L27/50;;B29C59/142;;B29L2031/7532;;C07K14/52;;B29C59/142;;A61L27/50;;A61L27/3804;;B29L2031/7532;;C07K14/52,A61F/;;A61F2/00;;A61K45/00;;A61L27/38;;A61L27/50;;B29C59/14;;C07K14/52;;C12N5/06;;C12N5/08;;C12N11/02;;C12N11/08,,0,0,,,,PENDING

   An element management system (EMS) for monitoring elements of a communication network utilizes a plurality of clients, a plurality of network elements, and an element management system (EMS). The clients and the network elements are interfaced with the EMS. The EMS is configured to track which of the network elements are of interest to the clients and to automatically monitor the network elements based on which of the network elements are determined, by the EMS, to be of interest to the clients. The EMS is further configured to provide the clients with information indicative of the monitored elements. Furthermore, the EMS may be configured to store graphical user interface (GUI) code that can be utilized to provide a GUI for monitoring and/or changing a network element. The EMS may provide the GUI code to the clients on demand and may enable a user to update the GUI code stored at the EMS. Moreover, a single update to the GUI code at the EMS may effectively update the GUI code utilized by any or all of the clients.

The message window lists both read and unread messages. The read messages are displayed visually differently than the unread messages to distinguish between the two types. A highlight bar identifies a particular message in the list. The message window has a preview pane in which the highlighted message can be previewed by a user without opening that message into a separate window. Heuristics are employed to determine whether the user is likely to be reading the message while it is displayed in the preview pane. For instance, scrolling the message in the preview pane is evidence that the user is likely to be reading the message.

   Specially designed apparatus is utilized to provide convenient isolation of a wellbore junction from pressure and corrosion during an acid fracturing stimulation process performed in a main or branch wellbore portion downhole from the junction. The apparatus has an outer tubular portion which may be installed, in a single trip into the main wellbore, in a straddling and sealing relationship with the junction, and an inner tubular structure sealingly and removably received within the outer tubular structure. Fracturing acid may be pumped directly down the main wellbore, and then to the formation to be stimulated, via the interior of the outer tubular structure, after the removal of the inner tubular structure subsequent to its use in facilitating a downhole pressure test of a lower end seal portion of the outer tubular structure.

   An apparatus, program product and method propagate errors detected in an IO fabric element from an IO fabric that is used to couple a plurality of endpoint IO resources to processing elements in a computer. In particular, such errors are propagated to the endpoint IO resources affected by the IO fabric element in connection with recovering from the errors in the IO fabric element. By doing so, a device driver or other program code used to access each affected IO resources may be permitted to asynchronously recover from the propagated error in its associated IO resource, and often without requiring the recovery from the error in the IO fabric element to wait for recovery to be completed for each of the affected IO resources. In addition, an IO fabric may be dynamically configured to support both recoverable and non-recoverable endpoint IO resources. In particular, IO fabric elements within an IO fabric may be dynamically configured to enable machine check signaling in such IO fabric elements in response to detection that an endpoint IO resource is non-recoverable in nature. The IO fabric elements that are dynamically configured as such are disposed within a hardware path that is defined between the non-recoverable resource and a processor that accesses the non-recoverable resource.

In particular, such errors are propagated to the endpoint IO resources affected by the IO fabric element in connection with recovering from the errors in the IO fabric element. By doing so, a device driver or other program code used to access each affected IO resources may be permitted to asynchronously recover from the propagated error in its associated IO resource, and often without requiring the recovery from the error in the IO fabric element to wait for recovery to be completed for each of the affected IO resources. In addition, an IO fabric may be dynamically configured to support both recoverable and non-recoverable endpoint IO resources. In particular, IO fabric elements within an IO fabric may be dynamically configured to enable machine check signaling in such IO fabric elements in response to detection that an endpoint IO resource is non-recoverable in nature.

More specifically, errors are propagated to an end point I/O resource which is affected by the I/O fabric related to a recovery from the errors in the I/O fabric. Then a device driver or other program codes, used for accessing to each affected I/O resource, can be recovered asynchronously from the errors propagated from the accompanied I/O resources. In this way, recovery from the errors in the I/O fabric elements can often be made, before waiting for all the affected I/O resources to finish recovery. Also, the I/O fabric can be composed dynamically so as to be available for both recoverable end point resources and to unrecoverable endpoint I/O resources. In concrete terms, the I/O fabric element in the I/O fabric can be composed dynamically so that it enables machine check notification in the I/O fabric element, when it detects that the end point I/O resource has essentially become unrecoverable. <P>COPYRIGHT: (C)2005,JPO&NCIPI",IBM,BAILEY DAVID ALAN;;NGUYEN TRUNG NGOC;;NORDSTROM GREGORY MICHAEL;;PATEL KANISHA;;THURBER STEVEN MARK,,https://lens.org/074-570-634-675-042,Patent Application,no,0,15,8,8,0,G06F11/0712;;G06F11/0745;;G06F11/0793;;F41G1/35;;F41G11/001;;G06F11/0793;;G06F11/0745;;G06F11/0712,G06F9/50;;G06F11/00;;G06F9/46;;H02H3/05,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE
