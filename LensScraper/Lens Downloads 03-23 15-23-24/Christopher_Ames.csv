   A system for digitally demodulating optical hydrophone signals is provided. The system includes an optical hydrophone connected to an analog-to-digital converter and further connected to a digital signal processor. Within the digital signal processor, a demodulator is calibrated by a preferred automatic calibration circuit such that mixer frequencies are coherently mixed with the incoming acoustic signals received by the hydrophone. The automatic calibration circuit preferably determines an extreme case of phase offset by following a programmable routine including a series of tests. After the extreme case is detected, the precise phase calibration is known and provided to the demodulator mixer tables. The automatic calibration circuit can be utilized for automatic calibrations of multisensor systems containing large numbers of hydrophones.

    A system for digitally demodulating optical hydrophone signals is provided. The system includes an optical hydrophone connected to an analog-to-digital converter and further connected to a digital signal processor. Within the digital signal processor, a demodulator is calibrated by a preferred automatic calibration circuit such that mixer frequencies are coherently mixed with the incoming acoustic signals received by the hydrophone. The automatic calibration circuit preferably determines an extreme case of phase offset by following a programmable routine including a series of tests. After the extreme case is detected, the precise phase calibration is known and provided to the demodulator mixer tables. The automatic calibration circuit can be utilized for automatic calibrations of multisensor systems containing large numbers of hydrophones.

Parts are received in returnable containers and organized for line side delivery according to the manufacturer's production schedule. Parts are delivered to production line locations using multi-cart “trains” that transport parts to the locations. Trains made of multiple carts are assembled throughout the production day and loaded with containers holding the parts that are then delivered line side. A delivery management system application executing on a computer receives production schedule data as well as part and container data to determine which parts are needed throughout the day at the various production line side locations and when they are needed.,HONDA MOTOR CO LTD;;MIDWEST EXPRESS INC,AMES RYAN CHRISTOPHER;;CAMPBELL JOHN;;HANDA YOZO;;HICKS DAVID WAYNE;;KAWAGUCHI HIROSHI;;LEWIS JOSEPH P;;MINAMIKAWA MASAHIKO;;SWANK STEVEN MICHAEL;;TANAKA TOSHIHIDE;;NAGURA YASUSHI,MIDWEST EXPRESS INC (2009-04-09);;HONDA MOTOR CO.

In some database systems, a user may receive multiple messages at a user device. To efficiently determine responses to these messages, the user device may send the messages to a backend server for analysis. The server may perform natural language processing (NLP) to classify the message with one or more binary classifications and may extract metadata from each message. Based on the classifications and the metadata, the server may determine one or more actions the user device may perform to respond to each message. The server may send instructions to the user device indicating the suggested actions, and the user device may display these actions as options to a user.

In some database systems, a user may receive multiple messages at a user device. To efficiently determine responses to these messages, the user device may send the messages to a backend server for analysis. The server may perform natural language processing (NLP) to classify the message with one or more binary classifications and may extract metadata from each message. Based on the classifications and the metadata, the server may determine one or more actions the user device may perform to respond to each message. The server may send instructions to the user device indicating the suggested actions, and the user device may display these actions as options to a user.
