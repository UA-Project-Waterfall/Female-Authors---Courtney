    A computerized method of preserving stable calls during a split mode operation of telecommunications equipment includes the steps of sending a call block update message from a first side of the telecommunications equipment to a second side of the telecommunications equipment. The call block update message includes dynamic call state data on the stable call handled by the first side and stored in a call block file in the first side of the telecommunications equipment. The method includes sending a call block update acknowledgement message from the second side of the telecommunications equipment to the first side of the telecommunications equipment in response to receiving the call block update message. The above steps are repeated until all dynamic call state data in the call block file is duplicated and sent to the second side.
