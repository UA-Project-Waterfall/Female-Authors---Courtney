The invention also contemplates colorant-to-color and colorant-to-colorant translations. In one embodiment, an improved color-to-colorant map is first created by creating a multi-dimensional lattice, then dividing this lattice into sub-lattices of selected sizes. A ""nominal"" sub-lattice is then constructed for a given colorant. Next, that colorant is expressed as a function of color-dependent component parts, and this relationship is used to construct initial lookup tables to convert the input colors to average colorants. Then, final lookup tables are generated, one for each sub-lattice, to convert average colorants to actual colorants. The above steps are repeated for each colorant. This process effectively creates a high-speed color-to-colorant map. After the improved map is created, it is implemented in a processor, which uses the map during translation. When the processor is conducting a translation, the processor first determines the average value of a selected one of the colorants by processing its input colors with an initial lookup table. Next, the processor identifies the applicable sub-lattice for one of the colorants, and applies the lookup table of the identified sub-lattice to receive the actual colorant. After the processor repeats these steps for the remaining colorants to complete the translation, the resultant colorants may be displayed with an output device.",IBM,LOTSPIECH JEFFREY BRUCE,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (1995-03-02),https://lens.org/121-890-291-993-836,Granted Patent,yes,18,23,1,1,0,H04N1/6019;;H04N1/6019,H04N1/60,358/518;;358/501;;382/162;;382/167;;395/109;;395/131,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The plug has first and second wedge-shaped members (62', 62) manufactured from a suitable plastics material. The first wedge-shaped member (62') has a first sloping face received in sliding relationship with a matching face of the second wedge-shaped member (62) wherein, in use, when the first wedge- shaped member (62') is positioned nearest to an explosive material in the blast hole it has a larger surface area facing the explosive material than the second wedge-shaped member (62). In use, when a Shockwave from initiation of the explosive material in the blast hole encounters the first wedge-shaped member (62') it acts as a piston, sliding on the second wedge- shaped member (62) so that both wedge-shaped members exert diametrically opposed forces against the wall of the blast hole to lock the plug (60) in place.

The center transmits the message with an appended modulus that is the product of two specially selected primes. The transmission also includes an appended authentication value that is based on an original message hash value, a new message hash value, and the modulus. The new message hash value is designed to be the center's public RSA key; a corresponding private RSA key is also computed. Individual user devices combine a digital signet, a public modulus, unique hardware-based secret numbers, and an original message hash to compute a unique integrity value K. Subsequent messages are similarly processed to determine new integrity values K, which equal K if and only if new messages originated from the center and have not been corrupted.

As the piston reciprocates in an internal combustion engine, the abradable coating rubs against another component, such as a cylinder liner or wrist pin, to achieve suitable contact geometry, such as an oval, asymmetric, or other non-round shape. Thus, a costly machining process is not required to achieve the desired contact geometry. The abradable coating can also be applied to ring lands, skirt sections, or along pin bores of the piston.

   Software intrusion is proactively detected using a dynamically evolving audit log wherein log entries are generated in the audit log and key values are evolved based upon a one-way function depending on both the previous log entry and the previous key. The audit log with the generated log entries and the final key value is transmitted to a clearinghouse that detects software intrusion by analyzing these values. In an effort to reduce the size of the log to be transmitted, the log entries are assigned identical values, thereby only needing to transmit one log entry and the last key value to the clearinghouse.

The shape of the round surface is not greater than 0.1 mm from a circular shape, and thus is relatively inexpensive to machine. As the piston reciprocates in an internal combustion engine, the abradable coating rubs against another component, such as a cylinder liner or wrist pin, to achieve suitable contact geometry, such as an oval, asymmetric, or other non-round shape. Thus, a costly machining process is not required to achieve the desired contact geometry. The abradable coating can also be applied to ring lands, skirt sections, or along pin bores of the piston. The abradable coating can also be applied to a wrist pin or an opening of a connecting rod which receives the wrist pin.

   A system, method, and computer program product to prepare files for transmission in a broadcast encryption system to prevent piracy and enable traitor tracing. Typically, each file in a group of original files is modified to include variations of critical file segments. A file identifier denotes which set of variations corresponds to which file. The group of files is then broadcast with individualized codes that enable particular authorized receivers to properly process the modified files. The modifications in a pirated version of a file can identify which traitorous receivers contributed to its piracy; such receivers may be subject to legal action and selective cryptographic revocation. The invention minimizes the likelihood of falsely concluding an innocent receiver is traitorous yet can identify large groups of colluding attackers with only a small increase in broadcast bandwidth overhead.

Current through the transistor pass element is compared to a reference signal by a comparator. If the current through the transistor pass element exceeds the reference signal, the comparator generates a fault signal, and the transistor pass element is switched off for the remainder of the cycle. After a predetermined number of faults, the transistor pass element is switched off for a plurality of cycles. The pulse width modulation circuit prevents damage to the transistor pass element caused by the low initial resistance of the load and supplies sufficient current to slowly heat the load to steady state operation.

The sound effect is controlled by means of a foot treadle that can uniquely control multiple parameters. The rate at which the foot treadle controls the effect is by means of a specific and unique optical coupling. To enable precise control of the effect, there is a visible read out of the modulation frequency which has not been achieved before in a foot pedal. Further, the modulation frequency can be controlled by a MIDI sync code which is also unique in a foot-pedal format.",PURCHON JEFFREY H;;RITZ BRUCE F,PURCHON JEFFREY H;;RITZ BRUCE F,GIG-FX INC (2006-04-16),https://lens.org/152-579-534-870-885,Patent Application,yes,34,33,2,3,0,G10H1/0091;;G10H1/348;;G10H2220/071;;G10H1/348;;G10H2220/071;;G10H1/0091,G10H1/32;;G10H3/00,84/746,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The electric field in the gate insulator is reduced without degrading device performance by limiting the field only when the gate voltage exceeds its nominal range. The field is limited by lowering the impurity concentration in a polysilicon gate electrode so that the voltage drop across the gate insulator is reduced. In order to avoid degrading the device performance when the device is operating with nominal voltage levels, a fixed charge is imposed at the interface between the gate electrode and the gate insulator, so at a gate voltage of about the supply voltage level the response changes to exhibit less increase in the drop across the gate insulator for higher voltages. Also, the impurity level in the gate electrode may be low enough so that the gate is in deep depletion for transient increases in gate voltage, thereby limiting the drop across the gate insulator.",DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP,FISHBEIN BRUCE JEFFREY;;DOYLE BRIAN SEAMUS,,https://lens.org/196-166-735-449-449,Patent Application,yes,0,5,14,14,0,H01L21/28185;;H01L21/28211;;H01L29/167;;H01L29/4916;;H01L29/51;;H01L29/94;;H01L29/4916;;H01L29/167;;H01L21/28185;;H01L29/51;;H01L29/94;;H01L21/28185;;H01L29/167;;H01L21/28211;;H01L29/51;;H01L29/4916;;H01L29/94,H01L29/78;;H01L21/28;;H01L21/336;;H01L29/167;;H01L29/49;;H01L29/51;;H01L29/94,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Outlet may also be included in the hub (222) and the shroud (224) of the turbomachine.

   An arc fault causes the line voltage across the line terminals of an arc fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) to change its characteristic voltage pulse shape as the line voltage is momentarily removed from the AFCI terminals after the arc extinguishes and before it re-strikes by introducing a flat voltage portion to the pulse shape. This flat voltage portion changes the voltage pulse width. An arc detector/processor detects this change in pulse width to produce a signal indicative of upstream (line side) arcing. The flat voltage portion can also be detected using clamping diodes and charging capacitors.

If one of the devices is a compromised device, at least one of the session numbers is a dummy number that is encrypted and decrypted by the corresponding compromised device key, with the resulting session key being useless in decrypting the program.

The conductive elements are spaced apart from each other by a ""conductor-free"" region, which serves as a spring loaded hinge about which the electrode may preferentially bend. The electrode is thereby spring loaded to adopt a substantially planar orientation in a relaxed state but is capable of bending to a non planar orientation wherein the electrode is folded about the hinge to facilitate intrathoracic introduction. After introduction, the spring loaded hinge causes the electrode to adopt its relaxed substantially planar orientation for attachment on or near the heart surface.

The model LFSRs are represented by respective tables of model LFSR output values that would be produced after a predetermined number of register shifts. The tables are accessed based on the initial value of the LFSR of interest, and the results of one table are combined with the results of the other table using an exclusive OR operator to thereby determine the output of the LFSR of interest.

A transistorized switch controls the electrical current in the pair of transistors in response to signals from a control register within the switching array.

The electric field in the gate insulator is reduced without degrading device performance by limiting the field only when the gate voltage exceeds its nominal range. The field is limited by lowering the impurity concentration in a polysilicon gate electrode so that the voltage drop across the gate insulator is reduced. In order to avoid degrading the device performance when the device is operating with nominal voltage levels, a fixed charge is imposed at the interface between the gate electrode and the gate insulator, so at a gate voltage of about the supply voltage level the response changes to exhibit less increase in the drop across the gate insulator for higher voltages.

For relationship recovery, each node maintains set of care relationships. Each relationship is of the form carer cares about care target. Care relationships describe process relations such as parent-child or group leader-group member. Care relationships are stored at the origin node of their care targets. Following node failure, a surrogate origin node is selected. The surviving nodes then cooperate to rebuild vproc structures and care relationships for the processes that originated at the failed node at the surrogate origin node. The surviving nodes then determine which of their own care targets were terminated by the node failure. For each terminated care targets, notifications are sent to the appropriate carers.

    An arc fault causes the line voltage across the line terminals of an arc fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) to change its characteristic voltage pulse shape as the line voltage is momentarily removed from the AFCI terminals after the arc extinguishes and before it re-strikes by introducing a flat voltage portion to the pulse shape. This flat voltage portion changes the voltage pulse width. An arc detector/processor detects this change in pulse width to produce a signal indicative of upstream (line side) arcing. The flat voltage portion can also be detected using clamping diodes and charging capacitors.

The electric field in the gate insulator is reduced without degrading device performance by limiting the field only when the gate voltage exceeds its nominal range. The field is limited by lowering the impurity concentration in a polysilicon gate electrode so that the voltage drop across the gate insulator is reduced. In order to avoid degrading the device performance when the device is operating with nominal voltage levels, a fixed charge is imposed at the interface between the gate electrode and the gate insulator, so at a gate voltage of about the supply voltage level the response changes to exhibit less increase in the drop across the gate insulator for higher voltages. Also, the impurity level in the gate electrode may be low enough so that the gate is in deep depletion for transient increases in gate voltage, thereby limiting the drop across the gate insulator.",DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION,"FISHBEIN, BRUCE JEFFREY;;DOYLE, BRIAN SEAMUS",,https://lens.org/137-832-619-567-781,Search Report,yes,1,0,14,14,0,H01L21/28185;;H01L21/28211;;H01L29/167;;H01L29/4916;;H01L29/51;;H01L29/94;;H01L29/4916;;H01L29/167;;H01L21/28185;;H01L29/51;;H01L29/94;;H01L21/28185;;H01L29/167;;H01L21/28211;;H01L29/51;;H01L29/4916;;H01L29/94,H01L29/78;;H01L21/28;;H01L21/336;;H01L29/167;;H01L29/49;;H01L29/51;;H01L29/94,,4,1,090-489-516-684-062,10.1109/55.31717,"IEEE ELECTRON DEVICE LETTERS, vol. 10, no. 5, May 1989, NEW YORK, US; pages 192 - 194; CHIH-YUAN LU ET AL.: 'Anomalous C-V Characteristics of Implanted Poly MOS Structure in n+/p+ Dual-Gate CMOS Technology';;INTERNATIONAL ELECTRON DIVICES MEETING SAN FRANCISCO, DEC. 11-14, 1988, MEETING 1988, NEW YORK, US; pages 238 - 241; C.Y.

This matrix is used to assign plural device keys each assigned to only one in-home device depending on each key index variable 'i'. In order to generate a session key for a broadcast program, all the device keys Si,j, are used to encrypt session numbers xi and to generate a session key block that is used to generate the session key that decodes the program by each in-home device. In the case that any of the devices is a device not permitted by the digital broadcast system a dummy number is assigned to at least a session number 50 that the dummy number is encrypted by a corresponding key for the device not permitted by the system and the resulting decoded session key is not useful to decode the program key.",IBM,JEFFREY BRUCE LOTSPEACH;;KEVIN SNOW MACURLEY,,https://lens.org/072-458-694-493-029,Patent Application,no,0,17,11,16,0,G11B20/00362;;H04N7/163;;H04N7/1675;;H04N21/2585;;H04N21/26613;;H04L2209/606;;H04L9/0861;;H04L9/14;;H04L2209/34;;H04N7/163;;H04N7/1675;;G11B20/00362;;H04N21/2585;;H04N21/26613;;H04L2209/606;;H04L9/0861;;H04L9/14;;H04L2209/34,H04H20/00;;H04L9/00;;H04L9/08;;H04N7/16;;H04N7/167;;H04N21/258;;H04N21/266,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A system and method for enabling authorized music from a CD or DVD to be compressed by a user for the user's own use, but to prevent the recompression of unauthorized music from, e.g., the Internet, includes hashing the music during recording with a cryptographic hash, and then signing the hash with a digital signature derived from the hash. Subsequent unauthorized compression and recompression will destroy the digital signature. Accordingly, music to be recorded is hashed to obtain a test digital signature and if, after hashing, the test digital signature matches the digital signature accompanying the music, compression and recording are allowed to proceed.

    An improved seal-insert and seal for a toner hopper as used in toner cartridge assemblies for printers, copiers and facsimile machines. In one embodiment, the seal has two slotted, rectangular outer pieces joined together with slot alignment and joined by an inner layer of two-sided tape. The two-sided tape is made with a long u-shape which does not interfere with the slots in the outer pieces. The open end of the u-shaped tape configuration allows a seal to be inserted or removed from between the outer pieces to close or open the slots. The seal-insert is applied over the passage from the toner hopper. The outer pieces are made from an antistatic and/or a conductive material, such as an aluminum laminate or plastic impregnated with conductive particles. Alternately, the outer pieces may be made from plastic covered with an antistatic and/or conductive spray or coating. In another embodiment, a tear-seal is made from antistatic and/or conductive material, and is provided with a tear-guide secured to and under the tear-sheet. The tear-guide has a width smaller than the tear-sheet and slightly smaller than the slot of the seal-insert. When the tear-guide is pulled by the enduser, the tear-guide will rip the tear-sheet in a straight line, providing an opening with an even width that will not block toner flow.

If the medium has a MKB that is newer than the stored MKB, then the MKB in the medium is used for content protection.

The technique can form part of the work-up process in which the polymer is removed from the polymerization vessel and separated from unconverted monomer(s) prior to isolation. By this technique, propylene is removed from polypropylene without using a purge stream of nitrogen which makes recovery of the propylene difficult and expensive.

   A method for tracing traitor receivers in a broadcast encryption system. The method includes using a false key to encode plural subsets representing receivers in the system. The subsets are derived from a tree using a Subset-Cover system, and the traitor receiver is associated with one or more compromised keys that have been obtained by a potentially cloned pirate receiver. Using a clone of the pirate receiver, the identity of the traitor receiver is determined, or the pirate receiver clones are rendered useless for decrypting data using the compromised key by generating an appropriate set of subsets.

This vigorous agitation is effected in the absence of any purge gas and the unpolymerised olefin monomer desorbed from the polymer by the increase in temperature can readily be recovered and recycled to the polymerisation vessel. The technique can form part of the work-up process in which the polymer is removed from the polymerisation vessel and separated from unconverted monomer(s) prior to isolation. By this technique, propylene is removed from polypropylene without using a purge stream of nitrogen which makes recovery of the propylene difficult and expensive. The technique additionally heats up the polymer which can be advantageous for subsequent processing.

The thiosulfate is recovered, and the regenerated sulfur dye catalyst can be recycled as part of the liquid treatment solution.",MERICHEM CO,JACKSON DAVID;;GOMACH JEFFREY BRUCE;;HARDY MICHAEL,,https://lens.org/136-067-775-095-710,Patent Application,no,0,0,18,18,0,B01D53/1468;;B01D53/8612;;B01D53/96;;C10L3/103;;C01B17/167;;C01B17/64;;B01J38/00;;B01J38/14;;E21B43/34;;C01B17/64;;B01J38/70;;B01J38/12;;B01J38/64;;E21B43/34;;B01D53/1468;;B01D53/1418;;B01D53/1425;;B01D53/52;;B01D2252/10;;B01D2251/604;;B01D2251/606;;B01D2251/608;;B01D2257/304;;B01D2251/304;;B01D2251/306;;B01D2251/404;;B01D53/1425;;B01D53/1468;;B01D53/52;;C01B17/167;;C01B17/64;;C10L3/103;;B01D53/1418;;B01J38/12;;B01J38/64;;B01J38/70;;C01B17/16;;E21B43/34;;B01D53/1412;;B01D53/1425;;B01D53/1468;;B01D53/8612;;B01D53/96;;B01D2251/2062;;B01D2251/304;;B01D2251/306;;B01D2251/404;;B01D2251/604;;B01D2251/606;;B01D2255/70;;B01D2256/245;;C01B17/167;;C01B17/64;;C10L3/103;;C10L2290/10;;C10L2290/12;;C10L2290/541;;C10L2290/547;;C10L2290/58;;Y02P20/584;;E21B43/34;;B01D53/1418;;E21B21/068;;E21B21/067;;B01D53/52;;B01D53/78;;B01D53/346;;B01D2255/70;;B01D53/8693;;C01B17/64;;B01J38/70;;C02F2103/10;;C02F2103/18;;C02F2101/101;;B01D53/8603;;B01D53/1425;;B01J38/12;;B01D2252/10;;B01D53/1468;;B01D2251/404;;B01D2251/604;;B01J38/64;;B01D2251/306;;B01D2251/304;;B01D2251/606;;B01D2251/608;;E21B43/34;;B01D2257/304,B01D53/14;;B01D53/52;;B01D53/86;;B01D53/96;;C01B17/64;;C10L3/10,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Specifically, the present application provides a process in which a feed stream containing hydrogen sulfide and another feed component is introduced into an absorber such that the feed stream flows upward from the bottom of the absorber and contacts a liquid treatment solution in which the liquid treatment solution contains a sulfur dye catalyst. The hydrogen sulfide is absorbed into the liquid treatment solution and converted to sulfur ions. Another feed component substantially free of the hydrogen sulfide is removed from the absorber vessel, and a waste treatment solution is also removed from the absorber vessel and fed to an oxidation vessel in which the waste treatment solution is contacted with an oxygen-containing gas to oxidize the sulfur ions to thiosulfates, and the thiosulfates are separated from the absorber vessel.

As a read-head is detected to move from zone-to-zone, coils may be activated to transmit information in those zones.",MULLEN JEFFREY DAVID;;LAMBETH DAVID;;CLOUTIER BRUCE;;DYNAMICS INC,MULLEN JEFFREY DAVID;;LAMBETH DAVID;;CLOUTIER BRUCE,DYNAMICS INC (2008-12-18),https://lens.org/097-713-440-345-782,Granted Patent,yes,108,73,135,135,0,G06K19/07;;G06K19/07703;;G06Q20/18;;G06Q20/20;;G06Q20/3415;;G06Q20/352;;G06Q20/385;;G06Q30/0222;;G06Q30/0241;;G06Q30/0277;;G06Q30/0641;;G07F7/0806;;G07F7/1008;;G06K19/06206;;A61B5/02;;A61B5/02042;;G06T7/62;;G06T2207/10024;;G06T2207/30004;;G06V10/24;;G06V10/25;;G06V2201/03;;G06K19/07;;G06K19/07703;;G06Q20/18;;G06Q20/20;;G06Q20/3415;;G06Q20/352;;G06Q20/385;;G06Q30/0222;;G06Q30/0241;;G06Q30/0277;;G06Q30/0641;;G07F7/0806;;G07F7/1008;;G06T2207/30004;;G06T7/62;;G06T2207/10024;;A61B5/02042;;A61B5/02;;G06V10/24;;G06V10/25;;G06V2201/03;;G06Q20/401;;G06K19/06206;;G06Q20/34;;G06Q20/341;;G06K19/07705;;G06K19/07707;;G06K19/07709;;G06K19/07749;;G06K19/0725;;G06K19/06187;;G06K19/07766;;G06K7/087;;G06K19/0704;;G06K19/0775;;G06K7/084;;G06K19/0723;;G06K19/07345;;G06K7/0004;;G06K19/07769;;G06F3/0488;;G06K19/07773;;G06K7/10297;;G06K19/0702;;G06K19/083,G06K7/08;;G06K19/06;;G06K19/07;;G06K19/077;;G06Q20/18;;G06Q20/20;;G06Q20/34;;G06Q20/38;;G06Q30/02;;G06Q30/06;;G07F7/08;;G07F7/10,235/449;;235/493,10,0,,,"The Bank Credit Card Business.

Das System umfasst einen Entnahmestromsensor, der den von der Brennstoffzelle entnommenen Strom misst, der dazu verwendet wird, die Systemlastanforderung zu erfüllen. Der Lastfolgealgorithmus verwendet den gemessenen Entnahmestrom, um die richtige Menge an Brennstoff und Luft zu bestimmen und damit die Lastanforderung zu erfüllen, und sieht dann einen Puffer für zusätzlichen Brennstoff und zusätzliche Luft für die Brennstoffzelle vor, so dass, wenn die Lastanforderung plötzlich zunimmt, die Brennstoffzelle unmittelbar die zusätzliche Abgabeleistung erzeugen kann. Wenn sich der von der Brennstoffzelle entnommene Strom in Ansprechen auf sich ändernde Lastanforderungen ändert, bewirkt der Lastfolgealgorithmus, dass die Menge an Brennstoff und Luft, die auf den Brennstoffzellenstapel aufgebracht wird, zunimmt und abnimmt, so dass der Puffer für zusätzlichen Brennstoff und zusätzliche Luft im Wesentlichen konstant beibehalten wird.",GEN MOTORS CORP,CLINGERMANN BRUCE JEFFREY;;MALLAVARAPU KIRAN;;CHOWDHURY AKBAR,,https://lens.org/113-694-965-284-81X,Patent Application,no,0,1,5,5,0,H01M8/04567;;H01M8/04589;;H01M8/04604;;H01M8/04753;;H01M8/04917;;H01M8/04992;;H01M16/006;;Y02T90/40;;Y02T10/70;;Y02E60/50;;Y02E60/10;;H01M16/006;;H01M8/04917;;H01M8/04753;;H01M8/04992;;H01M8/04567;;H01M8/04589;;H01M8/04604,H01M8/10;;G06F19/00;;H01M8/04;;H01M16/00,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
