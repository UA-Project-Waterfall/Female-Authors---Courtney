    The present invention comprises a device for clearing mines comprising a housing assembly with a chamber therein that carries a surface contact chemical that is capable of consuming the explosive fill within a mine. A nose assembly is attached to the housing assembly. The nose assembly separates from the housing assembly when the device contacts a solid mass. The nose assembly is capable of penetrating a mine housing and contacting the mine explosive fill sufficiently to expose the fill whereby the surface contact chemical can consume the fill. The present invention also includes a method of using a plurality of such devices in order to conduct a mine clearance operation in a surf zone or on a beach.

   The present invention comprises a device for clearing mines comprising a housing assembly with a chamber therein that carries a surface contact chemical that is capable of consuming the explosive fill within a mine. A nose assembly is attached to the housing assembly. The nose assembly separates from the housing assembly when the device contacts a solid mass. The nose assembly is capable of penetrating a mine housing and contacting the mine explosive fill sufficiently to expose the fill whereby the surface contact chemical can consume the fill. The present invention also includes a method of using a plurality of such devices in order to conduct a mine clearance operation in a surf zone or on a beach.

State sensors includes an electromagnetic sensor (204), an acoustic sensor (202), and/or an optical sensor (210, 220). The data gathered by the sensors is used to determine the operating state of the camera. Based on the operating state of the camera, the E-film apparatus operates in various power modes, including sleep mode, low power mode, and full power mode. If the envelope of the electrical signals from the sensors exceeds a threshold, the E-film apparatus awakens from a low power mode. Signal processing is then used to compare a measured waveform or spectrum to an expected waveform or spectrum. The E-film apparatus can also sense opening of the camera shutter (1304, 1306) by illuminating the shutter with a low duty cycle infrared light source (1402) and measuring the light reflected by the shutter.",SILICON FILM TECHNOLOGIES INC,STERN JONATHAN MICHAEL;;MIFFLIN ROBERT;;CARLSON RANDY,,https://lens.org/191-939-735-958-534,Patent Application,yes,2,2,3,12,0,H04N1/00132;;H04N1/00137;;H04N1/00148;;H04N1/00167;;H04N1/00196;;H04N1/2104;;H04N1/2112;;H04N1/2116;;H04N1/217;;G03B17/26;;G03B17/28;;H04N23/00;;H04N23/55;;H04N23/651;;H04N1/2104;;H04N1/217;;H04N1/2112;;H04N1/00196;;H04N1/00132;;H04N1/2116;;H04N1/00148;;H04N1/00137;;H04N1/00167;;G03B17/28;;G03B17/26;;H04N23/651;;H04N23/00;;H04N23/55,H04N1/00;;H04N1/21;;H04N5/225;;H04N5/232,,0,0,,,,PENDING

    An electronic film (E-film) apparatus that reversibly converts a conventional film camera body into an E-film camera is described. The electronic film apparatus includes one or more state sensors that sense the operating state of the camera body. State sensors include an electromagnetic sensor, an acoustic sensor, and/or an optical sensor. The data gathered by the sensors is used to determine the operating state of the camera. Based on the operating state of the camera, the E-film apparatus operates in various power modes, including sleep modes, low power modes, and full power modes. The electromagnetic sensor includes a loop or coil that converts electromagnetic fields into an electrical signal. The acoustic sensor senses vibrations in the camera due to operation of the mechanical aspects of the camera body. The acoustic sensor converts vibrations in the camera body into an electrical signal. If the envelope of the electrical signals from the sensors exceeds a threshold, the E-film apparatus awakens from a lower power mode. Signal processing is then used to compare a measured waveform or spectrum to an expected waveform or spectrum. The E-film apparatus can also sense opening of the camera shutter by illuminating the shutter with a low duty cycle infrared light source and measuring the light reflected by the shutter.

SOLUTION: The method included writing data fragments to the end of the removable storage volume in a first virtual storage system. In an advantageous embodiment, the data fragments are written to the end of the removable storage volume when the removable storage volume is closed. The data fragments contain information, such as data file headers, that uniquely identifies data files residing in the removable storage volume. Then, the removable storage volume is transferred to a second virtual storage system. Upon receipt of the removable storage volume, the second virtual storage system updates a tape volume cache in the second virtual storage system utilizing the information contained in the data fragments without having to read each of the data files.",IBM,CARLSON WAYNE CHARLES;;KISHI GREGORY TAD;;PEAKE JONATHAN WAYNE,,https://lens.org/075-297-321-408-033,Patent Application,no,3,4,5,5,0,G06F3/0617;;G06F3/0632;;G06F3/0664;;G06F3/0685;;G06F12/0868;;G06F2212/213;;G06F2212/217;;G06F2212/463;;G06F12/0868;;G06F3/0664;;G06F3/0632;;G06F2212/217;;G06F3/0685;;G06F2212/213;;G06F3/0617;;G06F2212/463;;Y10S707/99932,G06F3/06;;G06F12/00;;G06F12/08,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A method and system utilizing data fragments for efficiently importing/exporting a removable storage volume having a number of data files from a first virtual storage system to a second virtual storage system. The method includes writing data fragments to the end of the removable storage volume in the first virtual storage system. In an advantageous embodiment, the data fragments are written to the end of the removable storage volume when the removable storage volume is closed. The data fragments contain information, such as data file headers, that uniquely identifies the data files residing in the removable storage volume. Next, the removable storage volume is transferred to the second virtual storage system. Upon receipt of the removable storage volume, the second virtual storage system updates a tape volume cache in the second virtual storage system utilizing the information contained in the data fragments without having to read each of the data files. In a related embodiment, the data fragments include at least one data file, a file header preceding the data file and a data fragment trailer.

    A data acquisition system comprising a Configuration Manager for intelligently managing access to DAQ configuration information. The data acquisition system comprises a computer system coupled to a data acquisition device, a data acquisition application (user application) executing on the computer system, and DAQ driver level software executing on the computer system. The memory of the computer system stores a hardware database which includes information on DAQ objects in the DAQ system, and the memory stores configuration files which comprise desired configurations of the DAQ system. The Configuration Manager of the present invention executes in the computer system to control access to the hardware database and configuration files stored in the computer system. The present invention also includes a method for providing access to information on data acquisition (DAQ) objects in the DAQ system. The Configuration Manager accesses the configuration information from the system memory if the configuration information comprises modified parameter values stored in the memory, and the Configuration Manager otherwise accesses the configuration information from the hardware database. The present invention also includes a method for providing access to additional or new information on data acquisition (DAQ) objects in a DAQ system. The user of the DAQ system can receive an updated hardware database, and an existing configuration file can automatically access the additional capabilities of the DAQ object from the installed updated hardware database.
