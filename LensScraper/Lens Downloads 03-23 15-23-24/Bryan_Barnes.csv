    A complementary logic circuit is provided which provides improved switching times over known complementary logic circuits. The circuit includes a further n-type transistor connected in series between a p-type and an n-type transistor. This additional n-type transistor has its gate permanently connected to an upper supply voltage, Vdd. When switching occurs the n-type transistor is effectively open circuit. This allows the first n-type transistor to switch on by a substantial amount quite quickly without fighting the presently conducting p-type transistor. When the first n-type transistor has been turned substantially on second transistor becomes conductive. Then the p-type transistor is substantially turned off and no longer opposes the turning on of the first n-type transistor.

    A switching circuit is discussed that has an improved switching time in comparison with switching circuits of a known type. The circuit comprises three switches connected in series, the first switch being connected to an upper power supply and the third switch being connected to a lower power supply. The output of the circuit is connected to a circuit node located at the connection between the second and third switch. The input to the switching circuit is also connected to the third switch and additionally connected to a control circuit which provides a further output to control the first switch. The second switch is responsive to the voltage at the circuit node such that the second switch only conducts when the voltage at the output node falls below the upper supply voltage. This has the effect that the first switch is effectively isolated from the third switch during switching and allows a time delay during which the first switch is switched off under control of the control circuit and the second switch switches on. The provision of the voltage dependent second switch eliminates any current battles occurring between the first and third switch during switching.

    A ratio logic gate has a current mirror controlled by the pull-down transistors and supplying a half size pull-down transistor. When one or more of the input pull-down transistors is on, the mirror current overcomes the output pull-down transistor to provide a high potential output. Process tolerances between p and n type devices is thus avoided.

The circuit comprises three switches (101,104,106) connected in series, the first switch (101) being connected to an upper power supply and the third switch (106) being connected to a lower power supply. The output of the circuit is connected to a circuit node (N) located at the connection between the second and third switch. The input to the switching circuit is also connected to the third switch and additionally connected to a control circuit (102) which provides a further output to control the first switch. The second switch (104) is responsive to the voltage at the circuit node such that the second switch only conducts when the voltage at the output node falls below the upper supply voltage. This has the effect that the first switch is effectively isolated from the third switch during switching and allows a time delay during which the first switch is switched off under control of the control circuit and the second switch switches on. The provision of the voltage dependent second switch eliminates any 'current battles' occurring between the first and third switch during switching.",SGS THOMSON MICROELECTRONICS,BARNES WILLIAM BRYAN,,https://lens.org/197-235-006-020-987,Patent Application,yes,4,0,4,4,0,H01L29/0634;;H03K3/356113;;H03K17/102;;H01L29/0634;;H03K3/356113;;H03K17/102,H01L29/06;;H03K3/356;;H03K17/10,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

    A circuit compares a first voltage and a second voltage using a comparator. The comparator has a current divider for dividing a bias current in accordance with the values of the first and second voltages, and for providing two currents. The comparator also has a current differentiation circuit for receiving the two currents and providing an output signal dependent upon the difference between the currents. At least one of the current divider and current differentiation circuits are arranged to weight one of the two currents with respect to the other current so that the output signal is only provided when the difference between the first and second voltages exceeds an offset value. A bias generator is provided which includes a second comparator having similar components in the same configuration as the comparator.

In order to cope with the challenges in this technique, we have developed an algorithm, conservative methylation array probe selector (CMAPS), which reutilizes the degenerate basis technology for tolerating human internal variations to tolerate cross-species mutations. The CMAPS performs a greedy search, based on a multi-sequence alignment, using a probe for any CpG in the human genome to obtain a maximum number of species. The CMAPS then sorts all probes and selects a final set so that an array can be prepared from exons, CpG islands, and external annotations of hypermethylation to hypomethylation regions that can query a large number of mammalian species and different genomic locations.",CALIFORNIA UNIV BOARD;;BILLIGREEK SHARE LTD COMPANY,HORVATH STEFAN;;ERNST JURGEN;;ARNESON ANDREW C;;BARNES BRYAN,,https://lens.org/059-100-546-217-789,Patent Application,no,0,0,10,10,0,C12Q1/6811;;C12Q1/6883;;C12Q2600/154;;C12Q2600/148;;C12Q1/6888;;C12Q1/6883;;C12Q2600/154,C12Q1/6876;;C12Q1/6811;;C12Q1/6874,,0,0,,,,PENDING
