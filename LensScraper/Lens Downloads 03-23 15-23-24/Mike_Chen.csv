    A system and method for implementing a z-range buffer during the generation and display of three-dimensional graphical images. The display screen is partitioned into a plurality of display blocks. For each display block, the z-range buffer stores minimum and maximum depth values (z-values) of a front layer of the block and a back layer of the block. The z-range buffer further stores a bitmask value where each bit in the bitmask associates a pixel in the block to either the front layer or the back layer. When a new triangle is to be displayed, the minimum and/or maximum z-values of the pixels of the triangle are compared with the minimum and/or maximum z-values of the front layer and/or the back layer. By making such z-comparisons, it is often possible to make generalizations of the z-values of the remaining pixels in the triangle without individually analyzing their z-values.

   A test structure is disclosed for determining the smallest acceptable tunnel opening size in a non-volatile memory cell. Additionally, defect density for one or more tunnel opening sizes may also be determined. In one aspect, the test structure has continuous strips of active area that are used to form a control path, a read path, and a write path. A dielectric layer is formed over the active strips. A one-dimensional array containing a number (N) of same-sized tunnel openings is formed on the write path. A layer of poly silicon is deposited over the dielectric and patterned into strips that are perpendicular to the active strips. The poly silicon strips are aligned with the tunnel openings and form a floating gate and sense device, which is capacitively coupled to external probe pads through the common control path. The test structure may have a series of write paths wherein a write path has a one-dimensional array of N same-size tunnel openings. The first write path typically includes an array of tunnel openings with a relatively large size, with each additional write path containing an array of tunnel openings of incrementally descending size. The test structure allows bulk (all N gates simultaneously) programming or erasing of any one-dimensional array of a tunnel opening size. Consequently, a large number of same size tunnel openings may be tested in parallel.

With the method: a detector is trained off-line with distinctive marks resulting in templates which are generated and recorded for each of said distinctive; sample images bearing suspect marks are received by said detector and the location and orientation of said suspect marks are identified; said templates are rotated and shifted for alignment of said templates to said suspect marks; said templates and said suspects marks are compared to determine whether there is a match. A microprocessor is programmed to become familiarized with a plurality of distinctive marks through training and to analyze and detect seals within tested documents. A memory stores the marks as templates. A scanner may be used with the system during training and detection to capture marks and tested images bearing marks for use by the system.

The desired alloy layer properties, including small crystal size and minimal impurity inclusions, can be produced by including higher relative levels of Fe ions in the electroplating bath while holding the bath at a lower temperature while plating from a suitable seed layer. The resulting alloy layer adopts a small crystal size (BCC) without significant inclusion of impurities, which advantageously permits annealing to an acceptable H _{C } while retaining the high B ₛ desired.

This method consists of a step a), where a succeeding scanning is selected and a location at which the succeeding scanning line should be outputted and a number which is a function of an error that may be caused, when the current scanning line is to be outputted; a step b) where when the error is greater than a 1st prescribed amount, the processing returns to the steps a); a step c) where the error is greater than a 2nd prescribed amount, the count is incremented, if the scanning count is equal to (n), the scanning line is outputted, the scanning count is set to zero and the processing returns to the step a); a step d) where the scanning count is incremented by 2; and a step e) where the scanning cunt is equal to (n) or larger, the scanning line is outputted and the scanning count is decremented by (n) and the processing returns to the steps a), and in other cases, the processing returns to the step a) as is.",XEROX CORP,JOHN W WOO;;CHEN MIKE C;;FAN ZHIGANG;;PHONG KIEN A,,https://lens.org/028-822-511-878-085,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,,H04N1/393;;H04N1/40;;G06T3/40,,0,0,,,,PENDING

A blister disk is rotatably supported on a spindle on a deck plate of the inhaler. A powder port, an advancing slot, and a lifter slot extend through the deck plate. A slider is attached to the deck plate and movable between open and closed positions. As the slider is opened, a litter moves up on a ramp on the slider to shear open a blister, so that the blister contents can be mixed with air and inhaled. As the slider is moved back to the closed position, the lifter is withdrawn and an advancing finger turns the disk to bring the next blister into position for opening to provide the next dose to the patient.",DURA PHARMA INC,JACKSON THOMAS R;;DAVIES KAREN;;CHEN JEFF;;LIGOTKE MIKE;;CAMERON ALLAN,,https://lens.org/034-527-516-982-127,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,16,0,A61M15/0045;;A61M15/0045;;A61M15/0006;;A61M15/0006;;A61M15/0033;;A61M15/0033;;A61M15/0048;;A61M15/0048;;A61M15/008;;A61M15/008;;A61M2016/0024;;A61M2016/0024,A61M15/00;;A61M16/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

SOLUTION: This method detects a security mark by using a digital image system. The method acquires a digital input image by utilizing an image input scanner (step S1), conducts binary coding of the digital input image (step S2), performs micro detection (step S3), performs macro detection (step S4) and performs collation (step S5). When a security mark is detected, the method prevents valid copy of input document (step S6).",XEROX CORP,WU JOHN W;;CHEN MIKE C;;FAN ZHIGANG;;KEAN A FONGU,,https://lens.org/139-765-040-939-115,Patent Application,no,0,6,2,2,0,H04N1/00846;;H04N1/00867;;H04N1/00875;;H04N1/00846;;H04N1/00875;;H04N1/00867,B41J29/00;;B41J5/30;;G06T1/00;;H04N1/00;;H04N1/387;;H04N1/40;;H04N1/46,,0,0,,,,PENDING

In the vertical, process or slow scan, direction, from the resampling ratio and from the image size variation, an algorithm can compute where, on the page, the scan lines may be deleted. For a numerical example, if the input is 400 pixels per unit time, resampling of four to one would yield one scan line every 1/100 of a unit. If, in addition, the image has to be reduced by 5%, then the final output would be one scan line every 1/95.sup.th of a time unit. This algorithm accomplishes this result by using a running sum of error terms. Simply stated, if it is known that the previous output scan was output at exactly the right time, the error is zero, but if the scan was output too soon or too late, there will be an error term. For each new scan that is now output, 1/400.sup.th of a time unit is added to the error term. Finally, when the error term rises to a predetermined threshold, then the algorithm knows that that is the closest approximation that can be made, the current scan line is output, 1/95.sup.th of a time unit is subtracted from the running sum, and the algorithm proceeds to the next scans.",XEROX CORP,WU JOHN W;;CHEN MIKE C;;FAN ZHIGANG;;PHONG KIEN A,XEROX CORPORATION (1999-04-27),https://lens.org/023-111-869-031-636,Granted Patent,yes,5,19,8,8,0,G06T3/4023;;G06T3/4023,B41J5/30;;G06T3/40;;H04N1/393;;H04N1/40,382/298;;345/439;;358/451,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

By performing address translation only at select hierarchical levels, a memory controller can be designed to have predictable I/O latency, with brief or otherwise negligible logical-to-physical address translation time. In one embodiment, address transition may be implemented entirely with logical gates and look-up tables of a memory controller integrated circuit, without requiring processor cycles. The disclosed virtualization scheme also provides for flexibility in customizing the configuration of virtual storage devices, to present nearly any desired configuration to a host or client.",RADIAN MEMORY SYSTEMS INC,LERCARI ROBERT;;CHEN ALAN;;JADON MIKE;;ROBERTSON CRAIG;;KUZMIN ANDREY V,RADIAN MEMORY SYSTEMS INC (2015-10-12),https://lens.org/095-474-958-486-135,Granted Patent,yes,140,19,34,78,0,G06F12/0246;;G06F2212/1016;;G06F2212/7202;;G06F2212/7205;;G06F3/064;;G06F3/0616;;G06F3/0688;;G06F12/0207;;G06F3/0659;;G06F3/0662;;G06F12/0246;;G06F12/109;;G06F2212/1016;;G06F2212/7202;;G06F2212/7205;;G06F12/1009;;G06F2212/7201,G06F12/1009;;G06F3/06;;G06F12/02;;G06F12/109,,96,7,032-407-678-498-224;;051-695-052-984-237;;082-767-394-447-890;;138-270-256-875-420;;005-331-438-835-60X;;138-270-256-875-420;;045-060-520-611-508,10.1145/2421648.2421656;;10.1109/msst.2010.5496976;;10.1109/hpca.2011.5749738;;10.1109/aspdac.2008.4483988;;10.1109/msst.2013.6558426;;10.1109/aspdac.2008.4483988;;10.1145/2592798.2592804,"NonFinal Office Action, U.S. Appl.

In the vertical, process or slow scan, direction, from the resampling ratio and from the image size variation, an algorithm can compute where, on the page, the scan lines may be deleted. For a numerical example, if the input is 400 pixels per unit time, resampling of four to one would yield one scan line every 1/100 of a unit. If, in addition, the image has to be reduced by 5%, then the final output would be one scan line every 1/95 th  of a time unit. This algorithm accomplishes this result by using a running sum of error terms. Simply stated, if it is known that the previous output scan was output at exactly the right time, the error is zero, but if the scan was output too soon or too late, there will be an error term. For each new scan that is now output, 1/400 th  of a time unit is added to the error term. Finally, when the error term rises to a predetermined threshold, then the algorithm knows that that is the closest approximation that can be made, the current scan line is output, 1/95 th  of a time unit is subtracted from the running sum, and the algorithm proceeds to the next scans.",XEROX CORP,WU JOHN W;;CHEN MIKE C;;FAN ZHIGANG;;PHONG KIEN A,,https://lens.org/135-863-752-974-625,Search Report,yes,2,0,8,8,0,G06T3/4023;;G06T3/4023,B41J5/30;;G06T3/40;;H04N1/393;;H04N1/40,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Esse algoritmo é um método para redimensionamento e reamostragem de uma imagem em uma etapa. Na vertical processo ou exploração lenta, direção, a partir da média de reamostragem e da variação de tamanho de imagem, um algoritmo pode capturar onde, na página, as linhas de exploração podem ser apagadas. Para um exemplo numérico, se a entrada é 400 pixels por unidade de tempo, a reamostragem de quatro para um poderia produzir uma linha de exploração a cada 1/100 de uma unidade. Se, além disso, a imagem tiver que ser reduzida em 5%, então a saída final poderia ser uma linha de exploração a cada 1/95 - ésimo de uma unidade de tempo. Esse algoritmo alcança esse resultado pelo uso de uma soma em processamento de termos de erro. Simplesmente declarado, se for conhecido que a exploração de saída prévia saiu exatamente no tempo correto, o erro é zero, mas se a exploração sair muito cedo ou muito tarde, haverá um termo de erro. Para cada nova exploração que é agora saída, 1/400 - ésimo de unidade de tempo é adicionado ao termo de erro. Finalmente quando o termo de erro cresce para um percentual mínimo predeterminado, então o algoritmo sabe que esta é a melhor aproximação que pode ser feita, é dada saída à linha de exploração atual, 1/95 - ésimo da unidade de tempo é subtraída da soma em processamento, e o algoritmo prossegue para as próximas explorações.",XEROX CORP,WU JOHN W;;CHEN MIKE C;;FAN ZHIGANG;;PHONG KIEN A,,https://lens.org/104-382-164-389-17X,Patent Application,no,0,0,8,8,0,G06T3/4023;;G06T3/4023,B41J5/30;;G06T3/40;;H04N1/393;;H04N1/40,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A method and apparatus for preventing or inhibiting effective reproduction of documents such as currency, checks, stock certificates, and any other printed document including a pre-defined security mark printed therein. The subject method and apparatus operate to effect a multi-step review of all digital image data acquired from a printed document to be reproduced for purposes of locating any potential security marks and further examining same for purposes of positively identifying a potential security mark as an actual security mark. If a mark is located and verified to be an authentic security mark, effective reproduction of the printed document will not be permitted and/or other security measures will be taken. A pretest of a mark consists of deleting the fine line patterns that may be printed on top of the mark by smoothing the data in an averaging process, and then determining the difference between the density of the darkest and lightest pixels in the area. A difference smaller than a predetermined value means that the mark is not valid.

The slots are open at a leading edge of the wheel shroud.",HONEYWELL INT INC,CHEN HUA;;LEI VAI MAN;;GU MIKE;;YAO CATHERINE;;DUAN JEFF,HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC (2013-05-09);;GARRETT TRANSPORATION I INC (2018-07-28),https://lens.org/067-181-131-400-845,Patent Application,yes,2,5,6,6,0,F04D25/024;;F04D29/4213;;F04D29/685;;F05D2220/40;;F04D25/024;;F04D29/4213;;F04D29/685;;F05D2220/40;;F04D17/10,F04D17/10,415/206,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

In the vertical, process or slow scan, direction, from the resampling ratio and from the image size variation, an algorithm can compute where, on the page, the scan lines may be deleted. For a numerical example, if the input is 400 pixels per unit time, resampling of four to one would yield one scan line every 1/100 of a unit. If, in addition, the image has to be reduced by 5%, then the final output would be one scan line every 1/95 th  of a time unit. This algorithm accomplishes this result by using a running sum of error terms. Simply stated, if it is known that the previous output scan was output at exactly the right time, the error is zero, but if the scan was output too soon or too late, there will be an error term. For each new scan that is now output, 1/400 th  of a time unit is added to the error term. Finally, when the error term rises to a predetermined threshold, then the algorithm knows that that is the closest approximation that can be made, the current scan line is output, 1/95 th  of a time unit is subtracted from the running sum, and the algorithm proceeds to the next scans.",XEROX CORP,WU JOHN W;;CHEN MIKE C;;FAN ZHIGANG;;PHONG KIEN A,,https://lens.org/161-423-490-973-094,Patent Application,yes,0,2,8,8,0,G06T3/4023;;G06T3/4023,B41J5/30;;G06T3/40;;H04N1/393;;H04N1/40,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

SOLUTION: The first pixel of four inputted pixels to a line 50 is directly loaded in a register 53 via a MUX (multiplexer) 51. The remaining three pixels are added together by an adder 52, defined as one input and loaded in the register 53. When the sum of these two inputs becomes 10 bit number in the register 53, the sum is outputted, divided by 16 in a shifter 54, an average of four pixels is calculated, defined as one input of an adder 58 and the partial sum from a RAM 56 transferred from a MUX 59 to an output register 60 is received. When this result is the partial sum of another part, it is returned to the RAM 56 by the MUX 55.

    A system and method for performing image compression using multi-threshold wavelet coding (MTWC) which utilizes a separate initial quantization threshold for each subband generated by the wavelet transform, which substantially reduces the number of insignificant bits generated during the initial quantization steps. Further, the MTWC system chooses the order in which the subbands are encoded according to a preferred rate-distortion tradeoff in order to enhance the image fidelity. Moreover, the MTWC system utilizes a novel quantization sequence order in order to optimize the amount of error energy reduction in significant and refinement maps generated during the quantization step. Thus, the MTWC system provides a better bit rate-distortion tradeoff and performs faster than existing state-of-the-art wavelet coders.

   A system and method is described for resolving a conflict detected while synchronizing a first data object in a first store associated with a mobile device and a second data object in a second store associated with a server. Once the conflict is detected, properties of the first data object are compared with corresponding properties of the second data object. If the properties and the corresponding properties that differ are designated as mergeable properties, the properties and the corresponding properties are merged. Merging the properties involves sending a preferred state associated with each of the properties and the corresponding properties to the mobile device and the server for updating the first data object and second data object, respectively, when an initial state for the properties and the corresponding properties is different than the preferred state. The preferred state is based on a likelihood that vital information would be lost if the preferred state did not replace the initial state of the property or the corresponding property. The merging is performed without user-intervention on the mobile device. In addition, the entire first data object or second data object is not sent to the mobile device to achieve the merge, thereby minimizing the data transfer to the mobile device.

   A cylinder head gasket has a multi-layered steel body that includes a unitary metallic stopper layer interposed between beaded outer layers. The interposed stopper layer has an asymmetrically formed bead defining at least one raised structure that circumferentially and closely surrounds a combustion aperture. Specifically, the bead defines a trough having a series of variations of thickness or widths about its circumferential dimension. An epoxy resin material substantially fills the volume of the trough about its circumferential extent, irrespective of the variable trough depth or width. In the disclosed embodiment, a metal/epoxy hard coating material is placed in and cured in the trough. To the extent that the trough has a varying height or width about its circumference, the hard coating also has a varying height or width about the circumference of the hard coating-filled bead, so as to provide a substantially uniform sealing pressure under predetermined variable conditions including bore distortion and machining tolerances.

SOLUTION: A detector (microprocessor) is trained by the use of an example note such as a bill in an off line. In the training, at least one template is generated by recording an image pattern of the example note on a test pattern to be detected. An anchor line in the template is discriminated from an anchor line indicated in the test pattern. The template is rotated and shifted so that the anchor line is aligned to a long line to be detected in the test pattern before matching the template with the test pattern. The template is compared with the test pattern to judge whether the anchor line exists in the test pattern or not.

The method can more accurately determine the location and orientation of a pattern and thus provides more reliable currency detection. A detector is trained off-line with example notes resulting in a stored template generated by recording a test pattern similar to a pattern to be tested; anchor lines are identified within said template which are further represented in subsequent test patterns. The template is rotated and shifted before matching it to the test pattern so that anchor lines align with long lines detected within the test pattern. The template and test pattern are then compared to determine whether there is a match. The system comprises a microprocessor is programmed to facilitate the training of a detector off-line with example notes which are scanned into said system wherein a template is generated by recording an image pattern of said example notes similar to a test pattern to be detected. The microprocessor identifies anchor lines within the template which are further represented in said test pattern; rotates and shifts the template before matching it to the test pattern so that anchor lines align with lines which may be detected within said test pattern; and compares the template to the test pattern to determine whether said anchor lines exist within said test pattern.,XEROX CORP,FAN ZHIGANG;;WU JOHN W;;MICCO FELICE A;;CHEN MIKE C;;PHONG KIEN A,XEROX CORPORATION (1997-11-11),https://lens.org/083-096-010-292-220,Granted Patent,yes,27,53,4,4,0,G06V10/245;;G06V10/32;;G06V10/245;;G06V10/32,G06V10/32;;G07D7/00;;G07D7/06;;G07D7/20,382/135;;382/199;;382/219;;382/289,3,0,,,"An article by A.

    The present invention relates to a tunable optical device  10  that includes an optical fiber device  12  having optical properties that vary with temperature and a heater  14  . The heater  14  is thermally coupled to the optical fiber device  12  . The heater  14  includes a metal layer  18  and two electrical contacts  20, 22  that are electrically connected to the metal layer  18  . The electrical contacts  20, 22  are spaced apart from one another along the metal layer  18  . The electrical resistance of the portion of the metal layer  18  between the contacts  20, 22  varies with temperature and serves as a resistive heater. The invention also includes a controller  16  that is electrically connected to the heater  14  . The controller  16  provides electrical power to the heater  14  and measures the electrical voltage across the heater  14  . The controller  16  compares the measured electrical voltage to a pre-selected reference value. The controller then regulates the amount of electrical current supplied to the heater  14  . By regulating the amount of electrical current supplied to the heater  14  the temperature of the heater  14  is controlled.

The computing unit receives the tracking signal via a network, and employs the received tracking signal as an input instruction upon the magnitude of the magnetic field.",UNIV NAT TAIWAN,CHEN BING-YU;;CHAN LI-WEI;;LIANG RONG-HAO;;CHEN MIKE Y;;CHENG KAI-YIN;;TSAI MING-CHANG;;SU CHAO-HUAI;;CHENG WEN-HUANG,NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY (2014-09-10),https://lens.org/077-259-205-922-487,Patent Application,yes,0,2,1,1,0,G06F3/011;;G06F3/011;;G06F1/163;;G06F1/163;;G06F3/0346;;G06F3/0346;;G06F3/03547;;G06F3/03547;;G06F3/046;;G06F3/046;;G06F2203/0331;;G06F2203/0331,G06F3/01;;G06F3/046,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
