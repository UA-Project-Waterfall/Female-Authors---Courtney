In at least one non-limiting embodiment, the SMP device is a 3D-printed SMP material sized to specifically fit and thus occlude an intracranial aneurysm (ICA). The SMP device may be delivered to the intracorporeal defect via a catheter having a heating mechanism wherein the SMP device is raised above its glass transition temperature as it is deployed, causing the SMP device to return to its permanent shape after it is deployed into the intracorporeal defect.
