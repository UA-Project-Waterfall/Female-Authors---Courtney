The invention relates to formulations of nerve growth factor and their use in prevention of cognitive, motor or sensory deficits associated with traumatic injury of the brain or spinal cord. The invention further provides methods for treating such injuries comprising the administration of nerve growth factor formulations into the injured central nervous system. The present invention is based on the identification of novel optimal nerve growth factor dosages and treatment schedules to be used in the treatment of brain injured patients.

These example restricted search capabilities may allow for an unbiased search that is simply restricted to those regions of interest to a decision maker. It will be appreciated that a restricted search does not mean that additional constraints, such as preference or biasing information, are utilized to reduce the search space into some feasible sub-space of the original optimization problem. Instead, the example restricted search may limit the search to a certain sub-space of the full multi-dimensional tradeoff space.",FERRINGER MATTHEW PHILLIP;;THOMPSON TIMOTHY GUY;;CLIFTON RONALD SCOTT;;DIPRINZIO MARC DAVID;;AEROSPACE CORP,FERRINGER MATTHEW PHILLIP;;THOMPSON TIMOTHY GUY;;CLIFTON RONALD SCOTT;;DIPRINZIO MARC DAVID,THE AEROSPACE CORPORATION (2010-09-22),https://lens.org/183-980-769-944-864,Patent Application,yes,0,17,2,2,0,G06N3/126;;G06N3/126,G06F17/30,707/769;;X707E17014,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The value of each of the conditional genes may be evaluated prior to determining objective values of each of the chromosomes. The objective values of each of the chromosomes may be used to evaluate the potential solutions embodied in the chromosomes and further drive to more optimized solutions.
