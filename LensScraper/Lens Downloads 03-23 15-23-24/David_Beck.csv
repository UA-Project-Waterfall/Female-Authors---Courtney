    Exterior finishing panels are provided which contain an elongated, thermoplastic sheet which is supported by a rigid support member disposed along a portion of the length of the sheet. The rigid support member has a flexural modulus which is significantly greater than the modulus of the thermoplastic sheet, so as to support the panel during handling and installation. The panels of this invention will be more kink-resistant, and will ride uneven walls better to present a flatter-looking finished wall surface. These panels are also capable of being worked with ordinary hand tools, such as a standard wood saw made of steel or carbide.

A pump system that utilizes a helix gas separator provides greater pump efficiency by effectively removing the gas phase of the fluid. The wellbore fluid received at a pump system is directed from an intake to a gas separator that utilizes a stationary auger. The stationary auger induces rotational motion of the wellbore fluid causing the wellbore fluid to separate into a gas phase and a liquid phase. The gas phase is directed to the annulus while the liquid phase is directed to the pump for pumping to the surface. As the stationary auger remains stationary during production or separation of the wellbore fluid into a plurality of phase, fewer moving components are required which decreases overall production time while decreasing maintenance or operational costs.",HALLIBURTON ENERGY SERVICES INC,BROWN DONN;;BECK DAVID,,https://lens.org/063-624-432-724-610,Patent Application,yes,5,0,8,8,0,B01D19/0057;;E21B43/128;;E21B21/08;;E21B21/067;;B01D19/0057;;E21B21/08,E21B43/38;;B01D19/00;;E21B43/12,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The fluid pools at an upstream side 106 of a nip 104 and is drawn through the nip 104. On a downstream side 108 of the nip, the fluid is stretched between surfaces of the two rollers to form a fluid filament 110. A fluid filament 112 grows longer and thinner as the surfaces of the rollers rotate away from each other.

The counter-rotation of the rollers (102, 104) stretches the feed fluid into a fluid filament between the two diverging surfaces of the rollers. The stretched fluid filaments break into a plurality of droplets at a capillary break-up point of the feed fluid. The baffle unit (200) introduces a baffle fluid within the interior of the device and the baffle fluid transports formed droplets of the feed fluid from the atomization device. Excess or misguided atomized fluid droplets are collected by the baffle unit (200) and are recycled back into the device for use in later atomization processes.

With the instrument proximate the web, the measuring signal is passed into the resonant cavity. A first fraction passes through the resonant cavity. incurring a phase shift. A second fraction is reflected from the cavity. The phase shift in the measuring signal is compared to the reference signal, and a first output signal is sent to a controller. The magnitude of the reflected signal is determined, and a second output signal is sent to the controller. Using the first and second output signals, the controller calculates a resultant property value (e.g. moisture content), using the combined values of phase shift and reflected power to cancel out the affect of distance of the e.g. moisture from the resonant cavity.

A pump system that utilizes a helix gas separator provides greater pump efficiency by effectively removing the gas phase of the fluid. The wellbore fluid received at a pump system is directed from an intake to a gas separator that utilizes a stationary auger. The stationary auger induces rotational motion of the wellbore fluid causing the wellbore fluid to separate into a gas phase and a liquid phase. The gas phase is directed to the annulus while the liquid phase is directed to the pump for pumping to the surface.

ENGLISH ELECTRIC CO. Ltd. March 23, 1959 [March 21, 1958], No. 9230/58. Class 38 (3). [Also in Group XXXV] The speed of a D.C. motor, having its armature connected to a supply through a gridcontrolled current converter, is controlled by a device responsive to the deviation of the motor speed from a reference value advancing the grid phase of the converter continuously from a phase corresponding to a high inverter voltage to a phase corresponding to a high rectifier voltage as the said deviation in motor speed increases in magnitude with a decrease in the motor speed below the reference value, a further device reversing the motor back E.M.F. relative to the converter and the sense of the speed deviation relative to the grid control device, whenever said deviation reverses in sense. As shown, an armature 10a of a motor 10 is supplied from a transformer 12 through a grid-controlled current converter 11. The voltage of a tachogenerator 19, coupled to the motor, is compared with a reference voltage selected by a speed control lever 18 positioning a slider 17a. The resultant voltage is applied to reversing contacts 20a, 20b and to reversing contacts 25a, 26a. Movement of the speed control lever from the neutral position closes contact 25a or 26a to apply the resultant voltage to an errorsensing amplifier 28 that limits the amplitude of the signal fed to a relay 27 that changes over contacts 27a, 27b when the signal applied to it reverses and reaches a predetermined magnitude. Contacts 25 or 26 are closed by the movement of the control lever from the neutral position and a relay 23 or 24 is energized to close contacts 16a or 16b and energize a field winding 14a of an exciter 14 supplying a field winding 106 of the motor 10. Polarized relays 29a, 29b are energized by the voltage drop across a resistor 30 and the appropriate relay changes-over contacts 20a, 20b so that the resultant voltage is applied in the correct sense to a negative error suppressing device 21, the positive-going output signal from which is fed to a control winding 22a of a grid control device 22 to vary the grid phase of the current converter 11 so that with increase in positive signal amplitude the converter changes from operating as an inverter to operating as a rectifier. In a modification, the relays 23, 24 reverse the armature connections instead of the field winding of the motor 10.",ENGLISH ELECTRIC CO LTD,BECK ALAN;;EVANS DAVID CHARLES;;GAVRILOVIC ALEKSA,,https://lens.org/015-805-442-284-200,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B66B1/30,B66B1/30,G3R RBN34         BN34;;G3R RB399         BN34;;H2J JD            JD(DC),0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Control of D.C. motors. ENGLISH ELECTRIC CO. Ltd. April 21, 1959 [April 22, 1958], No. 12814/58. Class 38 (3). [Also in Group XXXV] A separately-excited D.C. motor 10 has its armature connected to a supply transformer 12 through a grid-controlled converter 11, and, under motoring conditions, a winding 22a of a grid control unit is energized in accordance with the excess of a reference voltage from potentiometer 17 over a speed-dependent voltage from tachometer generator 19. The converter then acts as a rectifier and the motor operates at a stable speed. A reversal of the speed-error voltage reverses a control winding 16b of a bi-stable amplifier 16, so reversing the motor field excitation and the back E.M.F. As a result, polarized relays 29a, 29b operate to change-over the connections to a device 21 for operating the converter 11 as an inverter in accordance with the excess of the speeddependent voltage over the reference voltage, thus producing a braking current for the motor. A magnetic amplifier 15 has a control winding 15b which is arranged to reduce the energization of an exciter field winding 14a and hence the motor field excitation. The control winding 15b is supplied from magnetic amplifiers 35, 36, developing opposed voltages across resistors 37, 38. Control windings 35a, 36a are excited in accordance with the converter supply voltage, whilst windings 35b, 36b are supplied in accordance with the magnitude and sense of the motor field excitation. In addition, the energization of the windings 35c, 36c is dependent upon the magnitude and direction of the voltage developed across the motor armature. Under forward motoring conditions, with the converter operating as a rectifier, both of the amplifiers 35, 36 are biased so that the control winding 15b is de-energized. Any tendency for the motor voltage to increase above a predetermined value when the converter is operating as an inverter, however, increases the output of the amplifier 35 so that it exceeds the output of amplifier 36 and the winding 15b becomes energized in a sense tending to decrease the motor field excitation. In this manner, the motor voltage is prevented from substantially exceeding a value dependent upon the A.C. supply voltage. If this voltage falls below its normal value, a smaller motor voltage is sufficient to cause the amplifier 35 to energize the winding 15b and hence decrease the motor field excitation. Under braking conditions, when the motor is operating in the reverse sense, the amplifier 36 becomes effective to prevent the motor voltage from becoming excessive. In a modification, the amplifier 36 is omitted and the amplifier 35 has windings 35a, 35c only, a rectifier preventing energization of winding 35c except when the converter functions as an inverter. A reversing switch between the amplifier 35 and the winding 15b energizes the latter in a field-reducing sense for both directions of motor rotation. In another arrangement, an armature-reversing switch is controlled from the bi-stable amplifier 16, the motor field being excited uni-directionally from the amplifier 15.

    A leash handle assembly having a housing with a grip portion, a spool assembly rotatably mounted in the housing, a trigger movably mounted to the grip portion, and a dual-position switch mounted to the housing proximate to the grip portion. The spool assembly is adapted for winding and unwinding a leash cord. The movable trigger is actuated to inhibit the leash cord from extending or retracting, and released to enable the leash cord to extend out of the housing in response to an external force. The spooling assembly is spring biased to cause the leash cord to retract in the absence of trigger actuation and the presence of a preset external force. The dual-position switch operates in a first position to lock the trigger in an actuated position and in a second position to enable the moveable trigger to operate freely. The dual-mode switch is positioned to enable a user to actuate it with the same hand that grasps the leash handle and actuates the movable trigger.
