    A signal is transmitted from a sending chip to a first receiving chip in a communications ring via a first i/o set of the sending chip. A signal from the sending chip to a second receiving chip in the communications ring is transmitted via a second i/o set of the sending chip. The first i/o set corresponds to a first direction for the sending chip transmitting around the ring, and the second i/o set corresponds to a second direction for the sending chip transmitting around the ring. The transmitting via the first i/o set is for a circumstance where a number of chips interposed in the ring between the sending and receiving chips in the first direction is not greater than the number of chips interposed in the second direction. The transmitting via the second i/o set is for a circumstance where the number is greater. For a chip interposed between the sending and receiving chips, the transmitting includes traversing from one of the first and second i/o sets of the at least one interposed chip, to the other one of the first and second i/o sets of the at least one interposed chip. The signal traversing the at least one interposed chip is regenerated by the interposed chip.

Included within the invention and preferred are processes in which, when the alkali metal hydroxide solution of the particle surfaces is neutralized with the detergent sulfonic acid, a sufficient excess of such hydroxide is present so that the detergent acid is neutralized and enough hydroxide or alkaline neutralization products are left so that the product is of a pH in the range of 7 to 11. The neutralization reaction may be carried out step-wise and such is often preferable. Also, the products of such reactions may be spray dried directly for use as is or for addition to other detergent composition components or they may be crutched with other such components, e.g., inorganic builder and filler salts, and then spray dried. By utilizing the present method washing or ""rinsing"" of the zeolite may be avoided, crutcher moisture contents before spray drying may be kept desirably low and a product of excellent physical and washing properties, which does not objectionably deposit on washed materials, may be made and dried by an energy conserving process.",COLGATE PALMOLIVE CO,KICZEK ALEXANDER P;;SALMEN LEO A;;TOWER CLARK B,,https://lens.org/017-304-076-426-025,Granted Patent,no,0,0,34,35,0,C11D1/22;;C11D3/128;;C11D11/04;;C11D1/22;;C11D11/04;;C11D3/128,C11D1/22;;C11D3/12;;C11D11/04,134-30,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Included within the invention and preferred are processes in which, when the alkali metal hydroxide solution of the particle surfaces is neutralized with the detergent sulfonic acid, a sufficient excess of such hydroxide is present so that the detergent acid is neutralized and enough hydroxide or alkaline neutralization products are left so that the product is of a pH in the range of 7 to 11. The neutralization reaction may be carried out step-wise and such is often preferable. Also, the products of such reactions may be spray dried directly for use as is or for addition to other detergent composition components or they may be crutched with other such components, e.g., inorganic builder and filler salts, and then spray dried. By utilizing the present method washing or ""rinsing"" of the zeolite may be avoided, crutcher moisture contents before spray drying may be kept desirably low and a product of excellent physical and washing properties, which does not objectionably deposit on washed materials, may be made and dried by an energy conserving process.",COLGATE PALMOLIVE CO,KICZEK ALEXANDER P;;SALMEN LEO A;;TOWER CLARK B,COLGATE-PALMOLIVE COPANY (1979-02-14),https://lens.org/039-631-052-133-080,Granted Patent,yes,11,9,34,35,0,C11D1/22;;C11D3/128;;C11D11/04;;C11D1/22;;C11D11/04;;C11D3/128,C11D1/22;;C11D3/12;;C11D11/04,252/558;;252/140;;252/174.25;;252/179;;252/539;;252/540;;252/559,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A data processing system having a modified processor chip and external components to the processor chip. The processor chip is interconnected to the external components via point-to-point bus connections controlled by an integrated distributed switch (IDS) controller. The IDS controller is placed, during chip design, in the upper layer metals of the processor chip. When the data processing system is a multi-chip multiprocessor data processing system, the IDS controller operates to provide a pseudo switching effect whereby the processor is directly connected to each external component. The IDS controller permits the processor to have greater communication bandwidth and reduced latencies with the external components. It also allows for a connection to distributed external components such as memory and I/O, etc. with overall reduced system components.

    A method of improving memory access for a computer system, by sending load requests to a lower level storage subsystem along with associated information pertaining to intended use of the requested information by the requesting processor, without using a high level load queue. Returning the requested information to the processor along with the associated use information allows the information to be placed immediately without using reload buffers. A register load bus separate from the cache load bus (and having a smaller granularity) is used to return the information. An upper level (L1) cache may then be imprecisely reloaded (the upper level cache can also be imprecisely reloaded with store instructions). The lower level (L2) cache can monitor L1 and L2 cache activity, which can be used to select a victim cache block in the L1 cache (based on the additional L2 information), or to select a victim cache block in the L2 cache (based on the additional L1 information). L2 control of the L1 directory also allows certain snoop requests to be resolved without waiting for L1 acknowledgement. The invention can be applied to, e.g., instruction, operand data and translation caches.

A common potential bus is oriented along the elongated dimension of the tape and connects to the first beam leads, while a power bus is also oriented along the elongated dimension of the tape and is connected to the second beam leads. The application of power to the power bus and the simultaneous grounding of the common potential bus enables all electronic devices on the tape to be simultaneously energized and to be then subjected to an elevated temperature environment for static burn-in testing. To improve current conduction in the power and common potential buses, a tape comprising a non-conductive carrier (42) and a pair of interposer/conductor tapes (41) may be emplaced over the length of the tape bearing the chips. An additional spacer tape (50) is then emplaced over the interposer tape and forces the interposer conductors into contact with the power and common potential buses.

SOLUTION: The cache 60 includes a cache entry array 62 having various values, a cache directory 64 for tracing entries, and a substitution controller 66 which uses LRU algorithm altered selectively with a random number.

    A method of improving memory access for a computer system, by sending load requests to a lower level storage subsystem along with associated information pertaining to intended use of the requested information by the requesting processor, without using a high level load queue. Returning the requested information to the processor along with the associated use information allows the information to be placed immediately without using reload buffers. A register load bus separate from the cache load bus (and having a smaller granularity) is used to return the information. An upper level (L  1  ) cache may then be imprecisely reloaded (the upper level cache can also be imprecisely reloaded with store instructions). The lower level (L  2  ) cache can monitor L  1  and L  2  cache activity, which can be used to select a victim cache block in the L  1  cache (based on the additional L  2  information), or to select a victim cache block in the L  2  cache (based on the additional L  1  information). L  2  control of the L  1  directory also allows certain snoop requests to be resolved without waiting for L  1  acknowledgement. The invention can be applied to, e.g., instruction, operand data and translation caches.

    A method of improving memory access for a computer system, by sending load requests to a lower level storage subsystem along with associated information pertaining to intended use of the requested information by the requesting processor, without using a high level load queue. Returning the requested information to the processor along with the associated use information allows the information to be placed immediately without using reload buffers. A register load bus separate from the cache load bus (and having a smaller granularity) is used to return the information. An upper level (L1) cache may then be imprecisely reloaded (the upper level cache can also be imprecisely reloaded with store instructions). The lower level (L2) cache can monitor L1 and L2 cache activity, which can be used to select a victim cache block in the L1 cache (based on the additional L2 information), or to select a victim cache block in the L2 cache (based on the additional L1 information). L2 control of the L1 directory also allows certain snoop requests to be resolved without waiting for L1 acknowledgement. The invention can be applied to, e.g., instruction, operand data and translation caches.

    A method of improving memory access for a computer system, by sending load requests to a lower level storage subsystem along with associated information pertaining to intended use of the requested information by the requesting processor, without using a high level load queue. Returning the requested information to the processor along with the associated use information allows the information to be placed immediately without using reload buffers. A register load bus separate from the cache load bus (and having a smaller granularity) is used to return the information. An upper level (L1) cache may then be imprecisely reloaded (the upper level cache can also be imprecisely reloaded with store instructions). The lower level (L2) cache can monitor L1 and L2 cache activity, which can be used to select a victim cache block in the L1 cache (based on the additional L2 information), or to select a victim cache block in the L2 cache (based on the additional L1 information). L2 control of the L1 directory also allows certain snoop requests to be resolved without waiting for L1 acknowledgement. The invention can be applied to, e.g., instruction, operand data and translation caches.

The processing units may be grouped into clusters, while the memory is distributed using memory arrays associated with respective clusters. One memory array is designated as the lowest point of coherency (LPC) for the memory block (i.e., a fixed assignment) while the cache designated as the HPC is dynamic (i.e., changes as different caches gain ownership of the line). An acknowledgement snoop response is sent from the LPC memory array, and a combined response is returned to the requesting device which gives priority to the HPC snoop response over the LPC snoop response.

Based upon capacities of the plurality of buffers, the producer output indications, the buffer output indications and a number of grant messages output to the producer within a feedback latency of the control unit, the control unit whether the producer can output a packet without packet loss. If so, the control unit provides a grant message to the producer indicating that the producer is permitted to output a packet.

    A method of operating a multi-level memory hierarchy of a computer system and an apparatus embodying the method, wherein multiple levels of storage subsystems are used to improve the performance of the computer system, each next higher level generally having a faster access time, but a smaller amount of storage. Values within a level are indexed by a directory that provides an indexing of information relating the values in that level to the next lower level. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the directories for the various levels of storage are contained within the next higher level, providing a faster access to the directory information. Cache memories used as the highest levels of storage, and one or more sets are allocated out of that cache memory for containing a directory of the next lower level of storage. An address comparator which is used to compare entries in a directory to address values is directly coupled to the set or sets used for the directory, reducing the time needed to compare addresses in determining whether an address is present in the cache.

    A method of operating a multi-level memory hierarchy of a computer system and apparatus embodying the method, wherein instructions issue having an explicit prefetch request directly from an instruction sequence unit to a prefetch unit of the processing unit. The invention applies to values that are either operand data or instructions and treats instructions in a different manner when they are loaded speculatively. These prefetch requests can be demand load requests, where the processing unit will need the operand data or instructions, or speculative load requests, where the processing unit may or may not need the operand data or instructions, but a branch prediction or stream association predicts that they might be needed. The load requests are sent to the lower level cache when the upper level cache does not contain the value required by the load. If a speculative request is for an instruction which is likewise not present in the lower level cache, that request is ignored, keeping both the lower level and upper level caches free of speculative values that are infrequently used. If the value is present in the lower level cache, it is loaded into the upper level cache. If a speculative request is for operand data, the value is loaded only into the lower level cache if it is not already present, keeping the upper level cache free of speculative operand data.

    A method of operating a multi-level memory hierarchy of a computer system and apparatus embodying the method, wherein instructions issue having an explicit prefetch request directly from an instruction sequence unit to a prefetch unit of the processing unit. The invention applies to values that are either operand data or instructions. In a preferred embodiment, two prefetch units are used, the first prefetch unit being hardware independent and dynamically monitoring one or more active streams associated with operations carried out by a core of the processing unit, and the second prefetch unit being aware of the lower level storage subsystem and sending with the prefetch request an indication that a prefetch value is to be loaded into a lower level cache of the processing unit. These prefetch requests can be demand load requests, where the processing unit will need the operand data or instructions, or speculative load requests, where the processing unit may or may not need the operand data or instructions, but a branch prediction or stream association predicts that they might be needed. After a predetermined number of cycles has elapsed, the speculative load request is cancelled if the request has not already been completed.

    A method of operating a multi-level memory hierarchy of a computer system and apparatus embodying the method, wherein instructions issue having an explicit prefetch request directly from an instruction sequence unit to a prefetch unit of the processing unit. The invention applies to values that are either operand data or instructions. These prefetch requests can be demand load requests, where the processing unit will need the operand data or instructions, or speculative load requests, where the processing unit may or may not need the operand data or instructions, but a branch prediction or stream association predicts that they might be needed. Further branch predictions or stream associations that were made based on an earlier speculative choice are linked by using a tag pool which assigns a bit fields in the tag pool entries to the level of speculation depth. Each entry shares in common the bit field values associated with earlier branches or stream associations. When a branch or stream predicted entry is no longer needed, that entry can be cancelled and all entries that were to be loaded dependent on that entry can likewise be cancelled by walking through all entries sharing the bit fields corresponding to the speculation depth of the cancelled entry and tagging those entries as invalid.

    A method of operating a computer system is disclosed in which an instruction having an explicit prefetch request is issued directly from an instruction sequence unit to a prefetch unit of a processing unit. In a preferred embodiment, two prefetch units are used, the first prefetch unit being hardware independent and dynamically monitoring one or more active streams associated with operations carried out by a core of the processing unit, and the second prefetch unit being aware of the lower level storage subsystem and sending with the prefetch request an indication that a prefetch value is to be loaded into a lower level cache of the processing unit. The invention may advantageously associate each prefetch request with a stream ID of an associated processor stream, or a processor ID of the requesting processing unit (the latter feature is particularly useful for caches which are shared by a processing unit cluster). If another prefetch value is requested from the memory hierarchy, and it is determined that a prefetch limit of cache usage has been met by the cache, then a cache line in the cache containing one of the earlier prefetch values is allocated for receiving the other prefetch value.

    A method of operating a processing unit of a computer system, by issuing an instruction having an explicit prefetch request directly from an instruction sequence unit to a prefetch unit of the processing unit. The invention applies to values that are either operand data or instructions. In a preferred embodiment, two prefetch units are used, the first prefetch unit being hardware independent and dynamically monitoring one or more active streams associated with operations carried out by a core of the processing unit, and the second prefetch unit being aware of the lower level storage subsystem and sending with the prefetch request an indication that a prefetch value is to be loaded into a lower level cache of the processing unit. The invention may advantageously associate each prefetch request with a stream ID of an associated processor stream, or a processor ID of the requesting processing unit (the latter feature is particularly useful for caches which are shared by a processing unit cluster). If another prefetch value is requested from the memory hierarchy, and it is determined that a prefetch limit of cache usage has been met by the cache, then a cache line in the cache containing one of the earlier prefetch values is allocated for receiving the other prefetch value. The prefetch limit of cache usage may be established with a maximum number of sets in a congruence class usable by the requesting processing unit. A flag in a directory of the cache may be set to indicate that the prefetch value was retrieved as the result of a prefetch operation. In the implementation wherein the cache is a multi-level cache, a second flag in the cache directory may be set to indicate that the prefetch value has been sourced to an upstream cache. A cache line containing prefetch data can be automatically invalidated after a preset amount of time has passed since the prefetch value was requested.

    A method of operating a computer system is disclosed in which an instruction having an explicit prefetch request is issued directly from an instruction sequence unit to a prefetch unit of a processing unit. In a preferred embodiment, two prefetch units are used, the first prefetch unit being hardware independent and dynamically monitoring one or more active streams associated with operations carried out by a core of the processing unit, and the second prefetch unit being aware of the lower level storage subsystem and sending with the prefetch request an indication that a prefetch value is to be loaded into a lower level cache of the processing unit. The invention may advantageously associate each prefetch request with a stream ID of an associated processor stream, or a processor ID of the requesting processing unit (the latter feature is particularly useful for caches which are shared by a processing unit cluster). If another prefetch value is requested from the memory hiearchy and it is determined that a prefetch limit of cache usage has been met by the cache, then a cache line in the cache containing one of the earlier prefetch values is allocated for receiving the other prefetch value.
