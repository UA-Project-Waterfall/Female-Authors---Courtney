By having each line function either as an input line or an output line at a particular instant of time, the number of switches being served by a fixed number of total input and output lines is increased. For example, with eight total lines 28 switches are accommodated when the lines function either as input or output lines while when four separate lines are dedicated as input lines and four other lines dedicated as output lines only 16 switches are accommodated. In a further embodiment using two switches and a pair of oppositely disposed diodes at each cross point in the matrix the number of switches can be doubled (to 56 with eight dual input/output lines).",AMERICAN MICRO SYST,BAUER JERRY R,GA-TEK INC (1998-01-01);;AMI SEMICONDUCTOR INC (2000-12-21);;AMERICAN MICROSYSTEMS INC.

Bauer A means is provided for encoding and decoding data transmitted by a parallel data bus line (8). An encoding Exclusive-OR gate (23-l through 23-N) is provided for each data transmission lead. One input lead of each encoding Exclusive-OR gate (23-l through 23-N) is connected to the corresponding incoming data transmission lead in order to receive data to be transmitted on accessible data lines (8-l through 8-N). The other input lead of each encoding Exclusive-OR gate (23-l through 23-N) is connected via a code matrix (22) to a source of a random M-bit binary number (21). The output signal provided by each Exclusive-OR gate is the encoded data bit which is applied to one of the accessible data lines (8-l through 8-N). The encoded data is decoded by a circuit similar to the encoding circuit. In the decoding circuit a decoding Exclusive-OR gate (33-l through 33-N) is provided for each data transmission lead. One input lead of each decoding Exclusive-OR gate (33-l through 33-N) is connected to an incoming encoded data transmission lead (8-l through 8-N). The other input lead to the decoding Exclusive-OR gate (33-l through 33-N) is connected via a code matrix (32) which is similar to the code matrix provided in the encoding circuit (22), to a source of a random M-bit binary number (31), where the M-bit binary number provided is the same M-bit binary number provided in the encoding circuit (21). The output leads of the decoding Exclusive-OR gates (33-l through 33-N) are the transmission lines which carry the decoded data (9-l through 9-N).

Boreholes. SHELL OIL CO., CONTINENTAL OIL CO., SUPERIOR OIL CO., and UNION OIL CO. OF CALIFORNIA. Aug. 14, 1957, No. 25608/57. Class 85. [Also in Groups XXVI and XXXIV] Subaqueous apparatus for drilling or working in a borehole 24 comprises a floating vessel 20, a well-head base anchored over the borehole in a formation 23, laterally flexible guides 61 between the base and vessel, means for lowering the drilling or working tool from the vessel, and means for slidably connecting the tool and the guides so that as the tool is lowered it is constrained to register with the upper end of the borehole, Mounted on the vessel are a mud tank 51, a draw-works 25, a collapsible drilling rig 27, and a rotary table 36 mounted on gimbals over a collar 39. A length of casing 45 fixed in the borehole is secured to a pair of arms 58 resting on the formation. A circulating head 43 is releasably sealed to a receiver 44 which is releasably sealed to the casing. A guide post 60 extends from each arm 58, a guide line 61 extending from the bottom of each post out through the top, and a sleeve 63 connected to the head engaging each post. During the installation of the head it is first supported within the collar with the guide lines threaded through the sleeves and running over pulleys 69, 66. A drill collar 46 is lowered through the head, the bit 47 is secured to the collar, and the head is released, the bit engaging an internal shoulder within the head to support it. The head is lowered on to the receiver by adding drill pipe sections to the collar and is finally sealed to the receiver. With the bit slightly off the bottom of the borehole the pipe is rotated to give it a bow which will compensate for up and down movements of the vessel. Whilst the pipe is still rotating it is lowered until the bit begins to cut, a constant force being applied to the bit. During drilling, mud is supplied from the tank, down the drill pipe to the bit and is returned up the space between the pipe and the hole to the head from whence it passes through a drilling mud return line 55 to the tank. The drill pipe is withdrawn from the well by releasing the head from the receiver and hoisting the pipe, the bit engaging the shoulder within the head so that it is also hoisted. If drilling is to be discontinued in the event of a storm, a length of drill pipe slightly greater than the depth of the water is removed from the string, the remaining string is plugged by a tool affording a landing seat, and the remaining string is lowered until the tool seats on the circulating head. A well is completed by running the Xmas tree into the casing using the guide lines, sealing the tree to the casing, and connecting flexible hoses attached to the tree to the shore or a tanker. In the embodiment shown in Figs. 2 and 3 the arms 58 are connected to a sleeve 94 surrounding casing 92 which is screwed at its upper end to receiver 106 which also rests on an internal ring welded to the sleeve 94. The receiver has a slot 112 which facilitates raising and lowering of the casing and removal of the receiver from the casing. The circulating head has a sealing ring 117 which is contracted by hydraulic pressure to engage a groove 111 in the receiver. The drill pipe is resiliently gripped by a seal 190 rotatably mounted in the upper part of the head, the bearing supporting the seal being lubricated with water supplied through a port 151. A nipple 132 serves as the connection to a drilling mud return line.

A representation of the source is selected, dragged over, and dropped onto an icon representing a program module. The source and the program module are each associated with a type of data structure. If these types of data structures are different, then the destination is created in memory of the type associated with the program module. Once the destination is created, the data within the source is transformed to populate predetermined fields of the destination. One way of populating the destination is by determining which field in the destination corresponds to a given field in the source. Data from a given field of the source is loaded into the corresponding field of the destination. This is performed for each of the fields in the source, thus transferring the data into the destination from the source without having to manually re-enter or perform successive copy and paste operations on the data in the fields of the destination. Another way of populating the destination is by formatting data from each of the printable fields of the source into a predetermined rich text format to yield a formatted version of the source as if the source were being printed in one of the fields of the destination. The formatted data is then loaded into the field of the destination.",MICROSOFT CORP,BLISS WILLIAM J;;HUGHSON JR JERRY R;;BAUER LOIS E;;RAMAN SURYANARAYANAN;;ROBERTS MICHAEL L;;HORVITZ ERIC;;FINKELSTEIN ERICH S,MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (1997-04-14),https://lens.org/097-096-139-442-232,Granted Patent,yes,8,203,1,1,0,G06F9/44;;G06F9/44;;Y10S707/99943;;Y10S707/99945,G06F9/44,707/102;;707/104,6,5,062-525-821-701-439;;008-012-415-592-116;;012-359-122-028-64X;;161-212-970-200-138;;029-872-453-800-803,10.1145/45410.45430;;10.1145/45945.214327;;10.1145/62266.62291;;10.1145/637078.637081;;10.1145/42196.42200,"Intelligent Information Sharing Systems, Malone et al., Computing Practices, vol. 30, No. 5, May 1987.;;Knowledge Based Documents Classification Supporting Integrated Document Handling, Eirund et al, ACM Conference on Office Information Systems, 1988.;;A Rule Based Message Filtering System, Pollock, ACM Transactions on Office Information Systems, vol. 6, No. 3, Jul. 1988.;;Cooperative Work in the Andrew Message System, Borenstein et al., ACM Proc.
