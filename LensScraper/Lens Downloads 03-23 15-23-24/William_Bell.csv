W. Nov. 8. Chlorine; hydrogen.- Relates to apparatus for the electrolysis of solutions, especially of alkaline chlorides to obtain alkali and chlorine, by the use of a moving mercury cathode. In the example shown, there are three tiers of compartments, the two outer sets a containing (1) h o r izontal carbon anodes i passing through stuffing- boxes i<1>, (2) the electrolyte, and (3) a mercury cathode layer on the slightly - inclined floors. Outlets f<1> for gas, arranged above the level of the electrolyte, and serving also as overflow pipes for the electrolyte, lead to two mains f, each provided with a valve g. The valves being shut, the pressure accumulates in the chamber a, as chlorine is developed during electrolysis, and the mercury amalgam formed is forced thereby below an amalgamated bar j, forming a lute and connected to conductors leading to the dynamo &c. The amalgam then passes through glass tubes e having U-tubes or like gauges thereon, to the central tier of a chamber b containing water, which decomposes the amalgam, reforming the mercury and combining with the sodium to form caustic-soda solution. The water, in the example shown, enters the top chamber at l, and overflows successively through tubes l<1> to the other chambers, finally leaving the lowest chamber as a strong solution. Hydrogen is evolved during this reaction, and escapes through branch tubes m<1> to the main m. The valve of one tube f is then operated by any mechanism and the chlorine allowed to escape. The pressure immediately falls in that chamber a, and the mercury flows back. Or the mercury may be driven back by allowing the hydrogen to accumulate in the vessels b. The electrolytic action then re-commences. By setting the two valves g accordingly, the two tiers of chambers a may be worked alternately. In the example shown, the valve g is closed or opened at fixed intervals by a double hydraulic tumbling basin h charged with water from a supply tap h<1>. Other methods of operating the valve may be used, either electrical or mechanical. Strong brine is supplied to the chambers a, the supply being regulated by a valve also actuated by the tumbling basin h, and opened when the corresponding valve g is opened.",BELL GEORGE;;BELL GEORGE WILLIAM,BELL GEORGE;;BELL GEORGE WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/056-013-160-290-591,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Bell, G., and Bell, G. W. May 23. Chlorine; hydrogen.- In an apparatus for electrolysing alkaline chlorides, a liquid metal electrode is caused to move from an eleotrolytic cell a to adjacent chambers b by periodically varying the gas pressure in these chambers. The apparatus may consist of slate slabs h, h<1> and an iron wall g, the electrolytic compartment a being separated by iron and slate partitions d, which nearly touch the lower slab A'. Several cells may be arranged vertically. A mercury cathode is carried on a raised part of the lower slab h<1>, a thin layer of the mercury being always retained by ribs c on the raised part. Connection is made with it by a bolt o. An anode with radial arms i is supported over the cathode. The electrolytic solution is supplied at one end of the cell a, and is discharged, with the chlorine evolved, through an opening f<1> into a vertical pipe. The side chambers b are supplied with water through bent pipes, and the caustic solution from them overflows into a vertical pipe, having a liquid seat at its lower end. The hydrogen produced in the side chambers is discharged through a pipe m and a valve, which is periodically closed to cause the mercury to enter the electrolytic cell, and opened to allow it to return, by automatic electromagnetic apparatus shown in Fig. 3. The valve is opened directly by an electromagnet q, when the circuit of this is closed by mercury in a vessel r touching a contact wire r'. The contact compartment of the vessel r is connected by a cock r<5> to another compartment, in which the gas pressure in the hydrogen pipe m acts on the mercury, to close the circuit. When the valve is opened, a switch t', connected with it, independently closes the circuit of the electromagnet q, through a lower contact r<2> in the vessel r ; the valve is thus held open until the mercury falls below the lower contact r<2>. The cock r<5> regulates the rate of fall. Glycerine is placed on the mercury in the contact compartment to prevent sparking. In a modification, the valve is arranged to connect the hydrogen pipe alternately to a reservoir and to a pump from which hydrogen is supplied under pressure. Otherwise the mercury may be moved by pressure of a head of liquid.",BELL GEORGE;;BELL GEORGE WILLIAM,BELL GEORGE;;BELL GEORGE WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/075-455-166-193-108,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Automatic frequency control; light modulators. VARIAN ASSOCIATES. 12 Jan., 1968 [19 Jan., 1967], No. 1845/68. Headings H3A and H4F. [Also in Division G1] In atomic resonance apparatus such as an atomic clock a system of atomic resonators is optically pumped by a beam of radiation modulated by means including means for modulating the sense of rotational polarization of the radiation. The latter means may be a Pockels or Kerr cell adapted to switch the radiation from left to right circular polarization. The polarization modulated beam interacts directly with the resonators to cause spin precession and the pumping radiation has no amplitude modulation to interfere with measurements of the absorption of the radiation to determine resonance. The modulation frequency or the magnetic field may be swept at 100 Hz and the output pulse from a photo-cell receiving the radiation after it has passed through the atomic resonators which occurs at resonance may be displayed on a cathode-ray tube, or used to maintain the resonance condition. The invention may be used to lock an oscillator frequency to an atomic standard for a clock or as a magnetometer by measuring the modulation frequency at resonance by means of a counter. Light modulation.-A Pockels cell in which the electric field is perpendicular to the light beam 3, Fig. 7, comprises a crystal 17 in a torroidal resonant cavity 31 which may be fed with microwave energy by a loop 34. A similar cavity may be used to provide a field parallel to the light beam, Fig. 8 (not shown). The crystal may be potassium dihydrogen or dideuterium phosphate or potassium niobate, potassium tantalate, barium tantalate or potassium lithium niobate.",VARIAN ASSOCIATES,BELL WILLIAM EARL,,https://lens.org/014-676-007-353-254,Granted Patent,no,0,3,4,4,0,G04F5/14;;G04F5/14;;G01N24/006;;G01N24/006,G01N24/00,G1A AAL           AL;;G1A AR7           4;;G1A A247          4;;G1A A248          4;;G1A A269          4;;G1A A357          4;;G1A A358          4;;G1A A369          4;;G1A A402          4;;G1A A404          4;;G1A A405          4;;G1A A447          4;;G1A A448          4;;G1A A449          4;;G1A A457          4;;G1A A458          4;;G1A A459          4;;G1A A469          4;;G1A A478          4;;G1A A48X          4;;G1A A482          4;;G1A A486          4;;G1A A488          4;;G1A A491          4;;G1A A494          4;;G1A A525          4;;G1A A526          4;;G1A A528          4;;G1A A53Y          4;;G1A A532          4;;G1A A573          4;;G1A A70X          4;;G1A A70Y          4;;G1A A708          4;;G1A A78Y          4;;G1A A780          4;;G1N N501          -;;G1N N502          -;;G1N N514          -;;G1N N521          -;;G1N N553          -;;G1N N558          -;;G1N N561          -;;G2F FCE           FCE;;G2F F23E          FCE;;G2F F23E          11;;G2F F23R          FCE;;G2F F23R          11;;G2F F25P1         FCE;;G2F F25P1         11;;H3A ACX           -;;H3A AD2M          -;;H3A AG6           -;;H3A AXW           AXW,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The apparatus includes a base piece and a retainer piece. The base piece includes a plurality of base teeth and is attached to a pad driver disc of the rotary pad machine. The retainer piece includes quick-release tabs having locking ribs. When the retainer piece is inserted into the base piece, the locking ribs lock into the base teeth to hold the retainer piece to the base piece. Flanges on the base piece and the retainer piece hold the pad therebetween. To tighten the rotary pad holder, the retainer piece is pressed closer to the base piece until the locking ribs lock into the appropriate base teeth. To loosen the rotary pad holder or change pads, the quick-release tabs are pressed in towards each other which unlocks the locking ribs from the base teeth and the retainer piece can be removed from the base piece. The rotary pad holder does not over tighten or over loosen because any torque applied to the pad holder is resisted by the retainer wall edges hitting against the connecting walls of the base piece.",FLO PAC CORP,BELL WILLIAM E,FLO-PAC CORPORATION (1995-11-07);;CARLISLE FOODSERVICE PRODUCTS INCORPORATED (2003-06-25),https://lens.org/098-398-960-029-002,Granted Patent,yes,19,34,1,1,0,A47L11/4036;;A47L11/4036;;A47L11/164;;A47L11/164;;A47L11/4058;;A47L11/4058,A47L11/164,15/230.17;;15/230;;15/230.19;;15/98;;451/353;;451/508;;451/514,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Bell, G. W. May 27. Pneumatic springs; dash-pots.-Relates to pneumatic suspension devices for automobiles and like vehicles of the piston-and-cylinder type, and particularly to the type described in Specification 21,700/13 and which are disposed between the wheel and the axle and within the wheel hub. The main objects of the invention are to provide automatic means to maintain the piston air-tight in the cylinder, and to lubricate the same. Oil is supplied to the lower chamber 3<a>, Figs. 1 and 2, of the cylinder 3, to a depth to insure the complete immersion of the piston packing, by a conduit leading from the counterbored front face 1<e> of the piston 1, to which access may be obtained when the cap 16 is removed from the wheel 8. The piston 1 is provided with two packing-rings 11, 12, Figs. 1, 2, and 8, separated by a groove 11<c> leading to an annular chamber 11<b> formed in the piston or in the metallic rings 11<a>, 12<a> used to secure the packing-rings 11, 12 in position. Any oil which passes the packing-ring 12 is thus trapped in the chamber 11<b>. Air under pressure is automatically supplied to the device from time to time, to replace leakage or to enable the device to carry an increased load, through a conduit 9 communicating through a packing-gland 9<a> in the rear counterbored face of the piston, with a vertical conduit 9<b> leading to the annular chamber 11<b> in the piston; the air then passes through a valve 12<b> in the lower face of the chamber 11<b> and bubbles through the oil in the chamber 3<a>, the oil which has accumulated in the chamber 11<b> simultaneously passing back in to the chamber 3<a>. To permit air to escape when necessary, for example to accommodate a lighter load, a conduit 17<a> leads from the upper chamber 1<a> of the piston, through a packing-gland 17<c>, to a conduit 17. To prevent the oil from entering the enlargements 3<b>, Fig. 2, of the air chambers 1<a> of the piston, a tube 13<a> on the piston, communicating by a passage 1<c> with the upper chamber 1<a>, telescopes within a tube 13<6> on the cylinder 3. The bottom of the tube 13<b> is enlarged to form a ferrule 13, which acts in conjunction with the lower end 1<d> of the piston to form a dash-pot when the piston descends. To conserve the oil in the dash-pot formed between the upper end of the piston and the cylinder 3, the vent holes 10, Fig. 2, communicate with an oil reservoir 10<a>, oil being supplied when necessary through a conduit leading from the front counterbored face 1<e> of the piston to the upper face of the boss 1<f>. In a modification, a single conduit is used to convey air to and from the device. The piston 1, Fig. 7, is provided with h a tube 20 joining the air-inlet conduit 9<b> and the outlet conduit 17<a>, and fitted with a check valve 21. The valve 21, which is normally held closed by a spring 21a, is formed at its upper end with a piston 21<b> fitting air-tight in the tube 20 and containing a valve 24. In action, when air under pressure is admitted to the conduit 9<c>, the valve 21 is lifted, and air passes through the valve opening 23; when the air outlet valve is opened, the pressure of the air in the device opens the valve 24, and air escapes through the passages 27<c> and conduit 9<c>.",BELL GEORGE WILLIAM,BELL GEORGE WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/093-588-278-125-507,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,B60G11/26,B60G11/26,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   A shaped charge tubing cutter includes a minimal contact suspension to isolate the cutter explosive from the housing and sub structure. A charge detonation booster main-cavity is located on the juncture of the charge truncation planes. Explosive in the booster main-cavity is detonated by a shielded primer path. Explosive density in the primer path is less than the main-cavity density. A dense, powdered metal SC liner and an abruptly stepped jet window in the tubing cutter housing improve performance. The axial span of the jet window is preferably aligned with the axial span between the liner bases. A testing apparatus and procedure inexpensively verifies downhole performance.

   A pipe severing tool is arranged to align a plurality of high explosive pellets along a unitizing support structure whereby all explosive pellets are inserted within or extracted from a tubular housing as a singular unit. Electrically initiated exploding wire detonators (EBW) are positioned at opposite ends of the tubular housing for simultaneous detonation by a capacitive firing device. The housing assembly includes a detachable bottom nose that permits the tool to be armed and disarmed without disconnecting the detonation circuitry. Because the tool is not sensitive to stray electrical fields, it may be transported, loaded and unloaded with the EBW detonators in place and connected.

   A pipe severing tool is arranged to align a plurality of high explosive pellets along a unitizing support structure whereby all explosive pellets are inserted within or extracted from a tubular housing as a singular unit. Electrically initiated exploding wire detonators (EBW) are positioned at opposite ends of the tubular housing for simultaneous detonation by a capacitive firing device. The housing assembly includes a detachable bottom nose that permits the tool to be armed and disarmed without disconnecting the detonation circuitry. Because the tool is not sensitive to stray electrical fields, it may be transported, loaded and unloaded with the EBW detonators in place and connected.

Bell, G. W. June 6. Pneumatic springs.-Relates to pneumaticsuspension devices for motor-vehicles of the type in which the resistance is automatically regulated, to meet changes in the load, by means of the relative movement of the parts, such regulation, however, being unaffected by momentary movements due to vibration or road shocks. Fig. 1 illustrates such a device, in which the body of the vehicle is carried by a compressed-air cylinder B, in which works a piston A mounted on the axle C. When the cylinder is depressed owing to increase in the load, the arm 26 attached thereto causes compression in the chamber 1, and air passes through the orifice 13, and operates the valve 9 so as to open the main cylinder to the air - compressor pipe 18 Similarly, on a decrease in the load, the cylinder B is opened to exhaust. The present invention consists in utilizing the friction and inertia of the valve 9 for the purpose of maintaining it open to pressure until the main cylinder has returned to its usual position, and in positively closing this valve by a non-elastic link so that the closure occurs approximately at the time that the supporting-piston A reaches its normal position of suspension. In the form shown in Fig. 1, the closing-link consists of the rod 5 shouldered at 21 to engage with the piston 4, so that, when the piston rises owing to a decrease in the load, the valve 9 is operated directly. The friction of the valve 9 may be enhanced by suitable packing in adjustable glands or in certain cases by friction disks; and liquid may be employed instead of air to retard its operation. Alternative modifications show the application of the invention to rotary valves of the plug or tappet type; and in certain cases the wire-drawing of the air at 13 is dispensed with, the elimination of road shocks being effected by introducing a certain amount of lost motion before the valve 9 is opened to pressure. In a further modification, the elastic medium may consist of a spiral spring. A baffle, Fig. 11, may be provided on the exhaust pipe for the purpose of recovering oil from the compressed air escaping from the main cylinder B. The invention may be applied to the apparatus described in Specification 14,382/06.",BELL GEORGE WILLIAM,BELL GEORGE WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/051-421-653-372-414,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,B60G17/04,B60G17/04,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

BELL & HOWELL CO. 10 Oct., 1968 [10 Oct., 1967], No. 48108/68. Heading H4F. Relates to an apparatus for producing electrical signals indicative of a predetermined colour contact of a coloured image comprising a means for producing alternating first and second colour signal components, each of a different spectral range and a further means for obtaining separate colour signal components from said alternating components. The alternating colour components are produced at one output of a colour television camera 50 by means of a filter 20 through which light from the image passes to be converted into electrical signals by means of a camera tube 15, for example a vidicon. In the present embodiment the filter comprises alternating red and substantially clear filter stripes 22, 21 arranged orthogonally to the direction of scanning of tube 15. The resultant alternating red R and luminance Y signal is amplified at 26 and combined to form Y-R at terminal 30 by means of filters 27 and 29 and an envelope detector 28 and Y + R at terminal 33 by means of filter 32. These signals are then combined as shown to produce the separate Y and R signals at terminals 37 and 46 respectively. The blue component signal is produced in the usual manner using a filter 52 and camera tube 15<SP>1</SP> and is combined with the R and Y signals to produce a green component signal at terminal 65. In an alternative embodiment (Fig. 4, not shown) the camera tube 15<SP>1</SP> is also equipped with a filter (70) similar to filter 20 composed, for example, of alternating blue and clear filter strips. The three component colour signals are separated similarly as before. Alternatively, using the camera of Fig. 4, the colour difference signals R-Y and B-Y may be produced (Fig. 5, not shown). In any of the above embodiments the output signals may be recorded on magnetic tape and in the Fig. 4 embodiment the light passing through the two striped filters 20 and (70) may be recorded on separate frames on an intermittently moving monochromatic photographic film (Fig. 6, not shown), playback being effected by projecting the two sets of recorded images on to the two camera tubes 15 and 15<SP>1</SP> (Fig. 7, not shown).",BELL & HOWELL CO,BELL NORTON WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/191-308-244-623-472,Granted Patent,no,0,0,6,6,0,H04N5/84;;H04N23/13;;H04N5/84;;H04N23/13,H04N9/04;;H04N5/84;;H04N9/07;;H04N9/09;;H04N9/79,H4F FD1B6         33;;H4F FD1B9         33;;H4F FD1D1         33;;H4F FD1P5         33;;H4F FD1P9         33;;H4F FD1Q1         33;;H4F FD1Q2         33;;H4F FD1Q7         33;;H4F FD1T          33;;H4F FD12K2        33;;H4F FD12M         33;;H4F FD27C1        33;;H4F FD27S         33;;H4F FD30B         33;;H4F FD30Q         33;;H4F FD81P         33;;H4F FD83C5        33;;H4F FEN           EN,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Bell, W. R. May 3, [date applied for under Patents Act, A.D. 1901]. Loom shuttles; stop-motions; weftreplenishing mechanism.-In order that cops upon paper or other quills may be readily placed and firmly held upon the shuttle spindle, the spindle is con. structed of two hollow tapering semicylindrical parts A, B, which are soldered, brazed, or riveted together at their ends C and are normally kept apart by their own elasticity and the action of a leaf spring E. The heel H of the part A fits within the heel G of the part B, which has an end wall G<1> and is formed with an inner shoulder P to retain the spring E in position. When the spindle is raised into the position shown in dotted lines, the heel H comes against a stop J on the shuttle spring O, and is forced into the heel G, thus allowing the quill to be placed upon the spindle. The top and bottom of the spindle are preferably formed with teeth K, which bite into the interior surface of the quill. The parts A, B are stamped from sheet steel, and the heels G, H may be formed integral therewith, or may be stamped separately and afterwards brazed or soldered to the rear ends of the parts B, A. If it is desired to adapt the spindle to receive a stop-motion or weft-replenishing mechanism controlling member, which is held within the split quill until the weft is substantially exhausted, recesses are formed at the inner edges of the parts A, B at one side of the shuttle.",BELL WILLIAM ROBERT,BELL WILLIAM ROBERT,,https://lens.org/044-926-932-301-504,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The former 13 is rotated about its axis 14 whilst the guide is moved longitudinally relative to the former so as to form a figure of eight loop which is severed at the crossing point X-X to give a ""Y"" guide; if the bundle is also severed at Z two ""Y"" guides result. The winding may be such that severing at the crossover point gives a ""multitailed"" guide Fig. 4 (not shown), or the filament may be wound in a sinuous manner Fig. 5 (not shown), or as a re-entrant helix, Fig.6, wherein severing at A gives a long straight guide.

In the arrangement shown in Figs. 3 and 4, the prongs pass through holes 6, and are locked in place by a plate 8 having extensions 9, which engage beneath the turned-over end 7. The outer prongs are made from a single piece of wire, and the plate 8 is secured by a rivet or screw. In the arrangement shown in Figs. 7 and 8, the prongs are bent round a pivot or socket piece, so that they lie in grooves 10. The prongs are then passed through holes 6 in the fork blank 11, and the broad part of the blank is bent round the pivot or socket piece, and is secured by a rivet &c. Figs. 11 and 12 show a modification in which the prongs are secured by a socket-piece 16, which is adapted to fill the space 14 and has grooves 18 to receive the ends of the prongs. The prongs may be arranged as shown in Fig. 14, in which case the socket-piece 16 has lugs 19, Fig. 13, provided with holes 20 to receive the double prong. In the arrangement shown in Figs. 15 and 16, the prongs pass through holes near the end of the fork blank, and the fixing-plate has fingers 26 which engage between the bent ends of the prongs. Notches may be formed in the end of the fork blank to receive upwardly-bent portions of the prongs. The fixing-plate, Fig. 16, and the fork blank may be modified so that half of the socket is formed in each of them. In the arrangement shown in Figs. 27 and 29, the prongs pass through holes in the down-turned end 40 of the fork blank, and have bent ends which engage holes 33. The prongs are secured by riveting the parts 28 of a fixing-plate, Fig. 27, arranged similarly to the fixing-plate described in Specification 432/83. The fixing - plate may be arranged to form a socket-piece instead of a pivot-piece; in this case, the down-turned end 40 is omitted, or has notches, instead of holes, to receive the prongs, . and the ends of the prongs which pass through the holes 33 are bent down over the face of the fork blank. In the arrangement shown in Figs. 36 and 37, the parts 37, 38 are turned down at'right-angles to the body of the fork blank.

Magnetic video tape recording. BELL & HOWELL CO. 22 Aug., 1967 [22 Aug., 1966], No. 38549/67. Heading G5R. [Also in Division H4] To balance out delay distortion in video signal magnetic tape recording and playback apparatus, a composite video signal including a pattern of horizontal and vertical synchronizing pulses defining the commencement of respective horizontal scanning lines and vertical line sequences is recorded on a magnetic tape driven past a rotating transducer head scanned across the tape at an angle to its direction of movement, and the recorded signals are played back by moving the tape in the same direction as during recording past a position at which it is scanned by a rotating transducer head moving along each recorded track in the direction opposite to that of head movement during recording. Preferably the played-back signals are reproduced by applying them to modulate a scanning beam deflected in a series of horizontal lines synchronous with the horizontal synchronizing pulses in the played-back signal, the direction of scanning of each line being opposite to the direction of line scanning during development of the initial video signal. As shown in Fig. 1, magnetic tape 10 is drawn by a capstan 16 (acting also as a guide roller) from a supply reel around a guide roller 14 and around a fixed drum 12 having a slot 20. The tape is scanned through the slot 20 by magnetic heads 22 and 24 rotated by a motor 28. Reversal of rotation of the heads during playback, as required by the invention, is provided for by a switch 34, which governs the direction of rotation of the motor 28. The motor 28 may be a synchronous motor including a split phase starting winding of which the phase is reversed by the switch 34 to reverse the direction of rotation. Control of proper tracking between the heads and successive tracks on the tape is provided by servo means controlling the motor 18 in a conventional manner. However, because the tape is moving in the same direction both on recording and on playback the foward motion of the tape subtracts from the angle of the track when the heads are rotated in one direction and adds to that angle when the heads are rotated in the reverse direction. This difficulty is overcome by providing guide roller 14 with flanges and making it adjustable along its axis so as to adjust slightly the path of the tape as it passes around drum 12. A complete recording, playback and reproducing arrangement is shown in Fig. 2. The output, from a video receiver 36 for receiving a broadcast television signal, or from a camera, consists of a composite video signal including horizontal and vertical synchronizing pulses together with amplitude-modulated video information. The signal is frequency-modulated at 38, amplified at 40, and fed to the heads 22, 24 through switch 42 for recording. At the same time the signal from receiver 36 may be applied through a switch 44 in the record position to a sync. separating circuit 46. The video information signal is amplified by a video amplifier 48 and applied to modulate the beam of a cathode-ray picture tube 51 in conventional manner. The horizontal and vertical synchronizing pulses are applied to horizontal and vertical scan generators 50 coupled by switches 52 and 54 respectively to tube 51 so that when the switches are in the ""record"" position, as shown, the normal left-to-right horizontal line scan and top-to-bottom vertical scan are produced. Playback.-It is assumed that the speed of motor 28 has been selected so that one complete frame of information is laid down in a single slant track scanned by one of the heads 22, 24. During playback, all the information in a single track is reproduced in reverse time sequence. This time reversal requires reversal of both the horizontal and vertical scans of tube 51, which is accomplished by switching switches 52 and 54 to the playback position, whereupon sawtooth signals of reverse polarity are applied to the deflection systems of the tube 51. (Switches 42 and 44 are in the playback position). Alternatively, where each pass of a scanning magnetic head records the video information making up a group of lines less than a complete frame, (e.g. one quarter), the vertical scan must be reversed during the reproduction of each group of lines, but the successive groups of lines must be positioned vertically in the order in which they normally occur. The waveform of the vertical scan signal has its slope reversed during each quarter interval of the vertical sweep, in this case, but the average slope is the same as in the normal scan. Where relatively narrow tape is used, and the magnetic heads are rotated substaintially transversely to the direction of tape movement, a single track on the tape may correspond to only a single line of video information. In this case, only the horizontal scan is reversed during playback while the vertical scan is normal.",BELL & HOWELL CO,BELL NORTON WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/050-623-021-071-663,Granted Patent,no,0,0,4,5,0,H04N5/91;;H04N5/91;;H04N5/93;;H04N5/93,H04N5/91;;H04N5/93,G5R RB11          84;;G5R RB264         RB33;;G5R RB264         84;;G5R RB283         RB33;;G5R RB283         84;;G5R RB29Y         84;;G5R RB291         RB33;;G5R RB291         84;;G5R RB33          RB33;;G5R RB37Y         RB33;;G5R RB37Y         84;;G5R RB38Y         RB33;;G5R RB40Y         84;;G5R RB402         RB33;;G5R RB402         84;;G5R RB403         RB33;;G5R RB403         84;;G5R RB476         RB33;;G5R RB476         84;;G5R RB481         RB33;;G5R RB481         84;;G5R RB511         RB33;;G5R RB511         84;;G5R RB512         RB33;;G5R RB512         84;;G5R RB55X         RB33;;G5R RB55X         84;;G5R RB55Y         84;;G5R RB58X         84;;G5R RB58Y         84;;G5R RB60X         RB33;;G5R RB60X         84;;G5R RB601         RB33;;G5R RB601         84;;G5R RB789         RB33;;G5R RB789         84;;G5R RB84          RB84;;G5R RB84          84;;H4F FDC           DC;;H4F FD12M         44;;H4F FD26M         44;;H4F FD69          44;;H4F FD73X         44,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Cooking and drying stoves; air-heating stoves.- Ovens and drying-chambers for baking food, for heating metal articles aftur varnishing, japanning, or lacquering, or for similar beating and drying operations, are built by superposing similar units or sections, thus forming an apparatus which may be heated by gas, oil or solid fuel in a bottom section. The doors and backs of the ovens being omitted, the structure forms a heater or store for warming air in or entering workshops etc.; the bottom of the oven may then serve as shelves for heating glue pots, food tins, or for similar heating and food-warming operations. Fig. 3 shows a section or unit consisting of a front wall 1, back 2, sides 3, 4, and bottoms 5, illustrated as broken away in order to show baffles 15 which may be fitted to form a sinuous flue beneath it. A series of such elements or units are superposed, as shown in Fig. 2, above a fire-box or burner chamber 9. The bottom section, containing an oven b, has a flue inlet a and an outlet 6a connected by a cap 12 to the inlet 6<c> of the flue c beneath the oven d. The gases are similarly conducted to the top section, which is covered by a flue 13 with an outlet 14. The front .wall 1 may have a hinged or sliding downward extension adapted to cover the oven below it, or each oven may have a door or pair of doors hinged to its side walls. The apertures 6, 7, Fig. 3, may be at the corners of the section as shown, or may be situated centrally in the walls of the flues. Large structures may be constructed by building two or more parallel vertical columns, the inlets 6, 7 of the flues in adjacent sections being arranged so as to communicate and form long flues under each horizontal range of ovens.

Bell, W. T. April 13. Systems of clocks; illuminated clocks.-The time of day is indicated at certain intervals, or letters and the like for advertising and other purposes may be formed and exhibited by apparatus such as that shown in Fig. 1. In the opaque front A of a suitable casing is formed a series of perforations A<1>, which are adapted to be closed by shutters A', so that, the case being illuminated from within, illuminated letters and figures may be formed on the front by opening certain shutters. In the same way figures to denote the time of day, with or without the addition of the letters P.M. and A.M., may be displayed at intervals. In this case three actuating-cylinders, mounted loosely on a common shaft G to control the formation of the figures denoting the units and tens of the minutes, and the hours respectively, are used, additional cylinders being used for any additional characters, that it may be desired to display. The cylinders carry longitudinal bars H<5>, which, as the cylinders are rotated, engage with the short ends D' of levers D straddled over a longitudinal bar D<1>, the levers being held in place by an upper bar D<2>. The other ends D<3> of the levers D engage with the bent ends D<6> of wires D<5> hinged to the shutters A'. Thus, through the arrangement described, the bars H<5> operate the shutters. There are, however, slits in the levers H<5> which allow some of the levers D to pass without being operated upon, and so some of the shutters will remain closed while those apertures which go to form the figures or letters will be opened. The first or unit cylinder is rotated a step intermittently by a pawl I<1> engaging with a ratchet I on the cylinder, the pawl being carried on a crank lever I<2> pivoted on the shaft G, and connected by a spring-rod P with the core 14 of a solenoid 15, which, when energized, causes the core to slide downwards towards its centre, thus operating the cylinder. The solenoid is energized every minute by a switch, operated by clockwork. One wheel of the clockwork has a pin which lifts a pivoted lever having a widened end which on its fall passes between two spring contacts and completes the circuit. The second and third cylinders are, by means of sliding bolts operated by cams, put into gear with the first cylinder and thus rotated, a step at certain intervals. The shutters may be dispensed with, the separate illuminations being effected by lamps arranged as described in Specification No. 16,220, A.D. 1897, [Abridgment Class Advertising &c.], which are automatically switched on by mechanism such as that used to lift the shutters. In this case the wires D<5> are connected with pivoted switch - levers having contacts at one end dipping into mercury caps. For the ordinary display of letters &c. a single cylinder is sufficient. According to the Provisional Specification, the arrangement of switch described in Specification No. 3177, A.D. 1899, [Abridgment Class Advertising &c.], may be used in connection with the electric lamps.",BELL WILLIAM THOMSON,BELL WILLIAM THOMSON,,https://lens.org/082-958-465-470-601,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

BELL. 27 Jan., 1970 [29 Jan., 1969], No. 4934/69. Heading H4D. In an acoustic thermometer comprising an acoustic transmission line along which ultrasonic pulses are conveyed to and from an acoustic resonator disposed in a region whose temperature is to be sensed, electronic means automatically vary the ultrasound carrier frequency to maintain resonance in the resonator as the temperature of the resonator varies. As shown in Fig. 1, magnetostrictive transducer 3 is silver-soldered or welded to a line 5 having at one end an isolator 1 and reflector 2 and at the other end a coupler 6 and acoustic resonator 7. Line 5 may be supported in loose (low acoustic impedance) mounts to avoid spurious echoes. A transmitted burst of oscillations of envelope a (Fig. 2) gives rise to an echo of envelope b which at resonance has a crossover region, the oscillations before the crossover being 180 degrees outof-phase with those after the crossover. A control loop error signal for varying the carrier frequency of the oscillation source to maintain resonance is derived by establishing early and late time gates c, d, each embracing a few oscillation cycles near the crossover; deriving a reference square wave R and its inverse R (Fig. 3), both synchronous with the carrier frequency; squaring-up the echo signal to give a signal S; applying signals S, R and c to an AND gate to give a first output representing the overlap of R and S before crossover; applying signals S, R and d to a second AND gate to give a second output representing the overlap of R and S after crossover; summing the first output and the inverse of the second output; and integrating the summation result. The locked resonance frequency is indicated digitally, and a frequencyto-temperature conversion circuit may feed a digital temperature indicator. Several acoustic resonators used in turn may be connected to the frequency-maintaining and measurement circuitry. Reference waves R and R may be derived by phase-shifting and squaring an output of the carrier frequency source, or, particularly if acoustic transmission lines of different length are used, from an oscillation burst triggered by the onset of the echo signal. Materials for the transmission line and resonator are specified. The thermometer may be used for automatically controlling furnace temperature.

The circuit means comprises storage capacitors, energy selector, computer, manual and reset switches, voltage monitor, current monitor, and output meter. The computer responds to certain external inputs, automatic and manual, and controls the output delivered to the patient. The energy selector permits the selection of the energy which is desired to be delivered to the patient. The sequence is started by closing the manual reset switch which zeroes the output meter and activates the power supply (electrical energy) at a voltage which is dependent on the energy selector. The energy derived from the power supply is stored in the storage capacitors. The energy selector, which is manually set to the energy desired, also feeds an input to the computer. When the manual switch is activated, the computer causes the stored energy source to be connected to the patient through the electrodes. The current monitor and voltage monitor feed instantaneous signals to the computer which computes the energy as a continuous integration process. When the computed energy equals the selected energy, the computer causes the energy source to be disconnected from the patient. The total energy delivered to the patient is indicated as a steady reading on the output meter. A modified form of the defibrillator is also disclosed wherein the magnitude of current in the electrical circuit means may be manually or automatically selected to enable the defibrillator to compensate for the patient's body weight.",HEALTH TECHNOLOGY LABS INC,BELL DAVID;;HAGAN WILLIAM K,HAS MEDICAL INC (1984-08-31),https://lens.org/038-511-216-825-17X,Granted Patent,no,1,62,1,4,0,A61N1/3937;;A61N1/3937;;A61N1/3912;;A61N1/3912,A61N1/39,A5R RHHD          HHD,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The hooked ends of the wires A, E are respectively actuated by feelers L, K and M, N, and corresponding cylinders H, J. Wedge-shaped cushions of buffalo hide Q<1> may be fitted within slots in the jack lever C' and form bearings for the lifting-wires. For the purpose of strengthening the hooked ends of the lifting-wires, the upper ends of the wires may be doubled back, and brazed ; or hooked castings, detachably connected to the upper ends of the lifting-wires, may be employed. Instead of using lifting-wires, such as wires A, E, Fig. 1, special lifting-rods, having ono or two beaks, may be employed ; each of these comprises two rods jointed together and normally held in alignment by two plate springs which extend from the joint along the sides of the upper rod. The lower rod passes through a slot in the jack lever, and carries a collar between which and the jack lever a piece of buffalo hide may be placed. For relieving the pegs of the pattern cylinders from undue strains, the feelers may be fitted with coiled or flat springs. Fig. 8<a> represents an arrangement of levers and links for actuating the griffes 27. An oscillating lever 16, connected to the tappet shaft by means of a rod 17, is formed with slots 17<a>, in which studs 18 are adjustably fitted. These studs carry antifriction rollers 19, travelling in the slotted ends 21, of two levers 23, which are connected to the griffes by links formed in two parts 24, 25. A weavers' warp or take-up beam, sand or emery roller, or tapers' beam, may comprise a longitudinally-slit metal tube 28, Fig. 9, into the ends of which are secured metal blocks 29, having slots 30 opposite the slotted portion of the tube 28 ; a strip of wood 31<a> is driven into the slots. In a modification, intermediate metal blooks may be employed, and several longitudinal slots may be formed for receiving as many strips of wood. A perforated metal strip may be wrapped upon the roller in the usual way, and be secured to the wooden strip, or strips, or a narrow strip of brass or other metal or material may be wrapped spirally round the roller, and a covering of webbing or like material may be put on to act as a cushion.

Pneumatic wheels; spring wheels,. hubs.-Relates to arrangements for neutralizing vibration, and consists in placing pneumatic or other spring devices in the plane of the wheel so as to avoid side strain and consequent friction. The Figures show one form of the invention as applied to the wheel hub of a bicycle. The wheel spindle, which is fixed rigidly between the fork ends, is formed of a central ring c and trunnions a. A cap c<1> screws into the ring c and forms a plunger, which works in conjunction with a cylinder d to form the spring device. An inflated air chamber k strengthened by a spring-wire coil k<1>, is placed between the plunger and the cylinder. The cylinder d is provided with hollow trunnions or projections d', within which slide vertically the ends a of the wheel spindle. Cones f are screwed on to the trunnions d' to form, in conjunction with races e<1> and balls d<2>, the ball bearings for the wheel hub e. The ring c and the cylinder d are provided with vertical guide-grooves, between which are placed balls or rollers to reduce friction. The air chamber k may be inflated by means of a valve v, to which access is obtained through an opening in the hub provided with a cover. The cylinder d is preferably formed of two parts, bolted together, so that the spindle a, c and plunger c' may be placed therein ; and the hub flange e<4> is arranged to screw into the hub to enable the spring device to be readily introduced into the hub. The shape of the hub flanges may be modified, a side aperture giving access to the valve v. In a modification, the wheel spindle is not provided with the central ring, but is secured to a suitably-shaped plunger. Two plungers and cylinders may be used, or the parts may be otherwise modified. The spindle a, c and plunger c<1> being rigidly fixed to the fork or frame b and the cylinder d to the hub c, the air chamber k practically forms a cushioning-device between the frame and the wheel to absorb vibration or shocks.",BELL GEORGE WILLIAM;;SHELMERDINE ANTHONY,BELL GEORGE WILLIAM;;SHELMERDINE ANTHONY,,https://lens.org/111-768-692-311-590,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The pattern chains of the cylinders 7, 8, 9 act directly on pivoted feelers 15 and indirectly on feelers 16; and the chains of the cylinders 10, 11 act directly on the feelers 16. The cylinders are driven by pawls 25, 27, 28, 29, 30 on a frame 24, which is reciprocated by connexions with the T-lever 5. When any repeating-cylinder is to be put out of action, a peg actuates a special balk lever 2, so that, by means of a rod 40, a shield plate 41 is moved so that the pawl 25 can drive the cylinder 7. A blank lag comes to the surface of the repeating- cylinder at the same time that the cylinder 7 is turned, and the latter cylinder indicates to the healds, always presenting a peg to the feeler governing the special balk lever. When any repeating-cylinder is to be put into action, the presence or absence of a peg on the chain 12 acts on one of four feelers 22, to remove one of the shields 32 and allow its cylinder to be driven.

B., and Jack, A. Feb. 11. Loom take-up motions.-Relates to means for producing an automatic recoil in the take-up motion, thereby letting back the warp, when the loom is stopped on the absence or breakage of weft. When this stoppage occurs, a catch G pivoted to an L-shaped bracket E, falls upon and pushes back the catch-rod finger C, thereby giving a partial turn to the catch-rod D, which raises the actuating and retaining devices of the take-up motion, a slip catch and additional ratchet being employed in this connexion. When the loom is started, the thickened part of a projection H bolted to the setting-on handle A raises the catch G, thus liberating the catch-rod finger C so that the actuating and retaining catches may fall into engagement again with the take-up ratchet-wheel. By swivelling back the catch G by the lug J, the catch-rod finger may be liberated, so that the take-up remains in operation with the loom stopped, for use in hand-weaving &c. In a modification, the curved end of a small swivel-piece, resting on the usual fork-slide and pivoted to the setting-on handle, comes behind the catch-rod finger and pushes it back when the loom is stopped. The weaver, if desired, may find the pick in a loose-reed loom by pushing home the fork-slide, lifting the brake, and pushing the spring handle half-way until the pick is found.",WHITE WILLIAM BELL;;JACK ANDREW,WHITE WILLIAM BELL;;JACK ANDREW,,https://lens.org/117-255-762-555-043,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The circuit means comprises storage capacitors, energy selector, computer, manual and reset switches, voltage monitor, current monitor, and output meter. The computer responds to certain external inputs, automatic and manual, and controls the output delivered to the patient. The energy selector permits the selection of the energy which is desired to be delivered to the patient. The sequence is started by closing the manual reset switch which zeroes the output meter and activates the power supply (electrical energy) at a voltage which is dependent on the energy selector. The energy derived from the power supply is stored in the storage capacitors. The energy selector, which is manually set to the energy desired, also feeds an input to the computer. When the manual switch is activated, the computer causes the stored energy source to be connected to the patient through the electrodes. The current monitor and voltage monitor feed instantaneous signals to the computer which computes the energy as a continuous integration process. When the computed energy equals the selected energy, the computer causes the energy source to be disconnected from the patient. The total energy delivered to the patient is indicated as a steady reading on the output meter. A modified form of the defibrillator is also disclosed wherein the magnitude of current in the electrical circuit means may be manually or automatically selected to enable the defibrillator to compensate for the patient's body weight or body resistance.",BELL DAVID;;HAGAN WILLIAM K,BELL DAVID;;HAGAN WILLIAM K,HAS MEDICAL INC (1984-08-31),https://lens.org/172-969-439-410-222,Granted Patent,no,4,52,1,4,0,A61N1/3937;;A61N1/3937;;A61N1/3912;;A61N1/3912,A61N1/39,A5R RHHD          HHD,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

H., and Jones, L. W. Nov. 26 Traction engines, internal-combustion engine. - A plough is provided with a motortractor, the driving- wheels of which are arranged to run at the bottom of the furrows, thus obviating packing the soil of unplouged land. The tractor carries a motor (not shown) driving transmission shaft 3, which is connected through change-speed and reverse gearing with a worm-wheel shaft 18, from which the axles of two driving - wheels situated towards the front and side and the rear and middle of the tractor respectively are driven through chains 24, 23. The axle-boxes of these wheels are adjustable to kecp the chains taut. The plough frame 77 to which are attached the ploughs 78 is connected to the tractor by a draught chain 79 and a lifting- chain 80. The machine is supported in front on the steering-wheels axle-bar 39 by a cable 40, attached at one end to a bracket 41 on the frame and at the other to a winding-drum 43, which passes over a pulley 44 mounted at the top of a column 46 capable of vertical movement within limits in guides 47 in the tractor and secured at its base to the axle-bar 39. The drum 43 is rotated to wind the cable and thus raise the frame on the front axle by clutching its shaft to a chain-wheel 56 constantly driven from the shaft 18. A rack or worm gear may be used for raising the front of the machine. The lifting-chain 80 of the plough frame, after passing over pulleys 81, 82, 83 on the tractor frame, is connected to the base of the column 46, so that the plough frame is raised or lowered with the front part of the tractor frame. The winding-drum-shaft clutch is operated by a hand-lever 86 which is connected with a slotted link 89 adapted to move a bellcrank lever 93, which throws the clutch in or out. A band brake on a brake drum 95 is simultaneously released or tightened, thus permitting the front of the machine to be raised by the winding-drum or to fall slowly by its own weight against the action of the brake. To prevent overwinding, a bell-crank lever, mounted on the guide 47 and having one arm secured to a cable attached to the steering- wheels axle-bar, is moved when the machine has been sufficiently raised, and throws out the clutch and tightens the brake. A pawl falls into a ratchet-wheel on the winding drum to maintain the machine in its raised position. The winding-drum clutch comprises pairs of friction blocks adapted to be expanded to engage an internal flange on a disk secured to the winding-drum shaft by screw-threads on shafts provided with arms angularly moved when the lever 93 is operated. The tractor is steered by front wheels 31, 32 revolving on axles of the Ackerman type, which are capable of swivelling on pins 35, 36, Fig. 6, mounted at the end of the front axle-bar 39. The axles are moved by arms 76 connected by links 75 with a lever 74, which is provided with a boss fitting a square vertical shaft 66, Fig. 1, supported by brackets projecting from the column 46. Levers 65, fitted on the shaft 66 between brackets carried by the guides 47, are operated by chains 64 adapted to be wound on a chain barrel 63 operated from a steering-wheel 58 through worm-wheel gear. The worm-wheel and the lever 65 may be connected by links and levers in place of the chains. A supplementary wheel 84 adjustable in height is fitted on the opposite side of the frame to the driving-wheel 28, to counteract any tendency to overbalance on that side. A brake block operated by a hand-lever acting through toggle-links is arranged to engage the back wheel. The rims of the driving-wheels are fitted with spuds and strakes and may be boxed in to prevent soil from accumulating. The machine may be employed as a tractor by lifting the ploughs clear of the ground and positioning the side driving- wheel on the axle of the end driving-wheel. The machine may be utilized for driving a threshing or other machine by fitting an extra shaft gear and driving-pulley.",BELL WILLIAM THOMAS;;WATSON WILLIAM HARDY;;JONES LEONARD WILLIAM,BELL WILLIAM THOMAS;;WATSON WILLIAM HARDY;;JONES LEONARD WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/060-441-535-065-530,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,B62D49/06,B62D49/06,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

H., and Jones, L. W. May 15, 1917. Ploughs.-A combined motor plough and tractor is provided with two front driving wheels and a rear driving and steering wheel. The engine A drives, through a clutch C operated by treadles D, a shaft E provided with a pinion H and driving pulley G. The pinion H, when the pulley G is not being used for driving other machinery, is ananged to mesh with a pinion J on a shaft K which drives, through change-speed and recessing gear operated by a lever S, a coun. tershaft W carrying two chain pinions X from which motion is transmitted to the front axle v and a chain wheel b on a universal joint shaft c connected by a universal joint d to the rear driving-wheel shaft e. This shaft carries a chain wheel n from which a chain wheel p, secured to the hub m of the back wheel, is driven. The hub m rotates on a wheel centre l pivoted on a central vertical pivot k passing through the fixed back axle j. The wheel centre l carries an upwardly extending arm in which the shaft e is mounted and this arm is extended and pivoted in alinement with the pivot k in a frame f extending upwardly from the main frame. The wheel centre l is adapted to be turned for steering purposes about its pivot k by an arm h secured to its upper extension and provided with teeth engaging a worm on a shaft 26 operated from the steering wheel 24. Adjusting pinions r, s are provided to tighten the chains. The front axle v is mounted in spring-cushioned axle boxes w fitted in horn brackets x which may be adjusted to tighten the driving chains. Each of the front driving wheels z is adapted to be clutched separately to the axle v through dog clutches 2 arranged to be thrown in by rotating cams operated by treadles 4, 5. A draw-bar 9 supported bv three horn plates 8 carries an adjustable spring plough hitch 10. A main drawbar 11 and an auxiliary draw-bar 12 are fitted at the rear of the machine. The ploughs 13 are lifted by means of three separate chains or wire ropes 14, 15, 16 connected to one main rope 17. The three ropes are so adjusted that the front plough is first lifted. The main rope 17 passes through a bell-crank lever 19 and is fastened to a drum 20 on the counter-shaft W. The lever 22 clutches the drum 20 to the shaft W to raise the ploughs, a clip on the main rope engaging the bellcrank lever 19 and throwing the clutch out when the ploughs have been sufficiently lifted. A ratchet and pawl device holds the ploughs at the required height. The ploughs are lowered by moving the lever 22 in the opposite direction to disengage the pawl, the clutch being slightly en. gaged at the same time to act as a brake. A band brake 27 on the front axle is operated by a hand-wheel 35.

An optical detector monitors the resonant optical radiation level within the optical resonator and produces an output signal for each of the relaxation spikes. A trigger circuit, responsive to the detected oscillator spikes, triggers the Q-switch so as to switch it to the second or lossless state upon receipt of the second or any other subsequent relaxation oscillator spike, whereby single longitudinal mode operation of the laser is enhanced. A pair of quarter wave plates are disposed on opposite sides of the laser gain medium within the optical resonator to make the power density distribution within the laser gain medium more uniform, thereby further enhancing single longitudinal mode operation.

    A seismic communication system suitable to communicate information to an underground device is disclosed. A seismic source (preferably on or near the surface of the earth) generates a timed series of seismic shots. These shots are then detected by one or more seismic receivers underground. Depending on the timing of these seismic shots, and the communication protocol selected, various information may be communicated to the underground target. Such a system is particularly desirable when the underground device includes a perforating gun because the perforating gun may not only be remotely detonated without the drawbacks of previous methods, but the detonation of the perforating gun charges may also be detected, giving an indication whether substantially fewer than all of the explosive charges detonated.

A cold-curing process for the manufacture of polyurethane foam comprises reacting in a mould without the application of heat a polymeric polyol which is an ethylene oxide tipped polyoxypropylene and a polyisocyanate having 2, 3 or 4 benzene rings each linked by a methylene group and each carrying at least one isocyanate group in the presence of a blowing agent. The polyisocyanate is preferably a diphenylmethane diisocyanate or a polyphenylene polymethylene isocyanate. Suitable polyols are block copolymers of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide or a glycerol-centred oxyethylene tipped polyoxypropylene triol. A catalyst such as a tertiary amine or an organic tin compound or mixtures thereof and a surface-active agent such as a polysiloxaneoxyalkylene block copolymer may also be included in the reaction mixture.
