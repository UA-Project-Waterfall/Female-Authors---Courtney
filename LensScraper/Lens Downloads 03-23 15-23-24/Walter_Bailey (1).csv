Fluid operated brakes. AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTS CO. Ltd. March 31, 1964 [April 4, 1963], No. 13422/63. Heading F2F. A valve controlling operation of a servomotor of an air or vacuum-suspended type comprises an actuating rod 6 associated with a piston 11 operable by fluid pressure in the master cylinder and a lever 13 operable by the master cylinder piston 18 in event of a fluid pressure breakdown therein to effect mechanical operation of the actuating rod 6. Two servomotors (not shown) are independently controlled by two valves 52, 61 arranged in tandem in a casing 7 which is attached off-set to the line of the master cylinder bore 9 so that the motor 11 intrudes beyond the end chamber 8 thereof. The lever 13 is a metal plate held at the end of the bore 9 by the reverse side of an end-cup 14 supporting the return spring 17 and has its end bent at 15 so that it pivots on the cylinder wall. In event of a pressure break-down the piston 18 travels beyond its normal stopping point and a projection 19 on its end causes the lever 13 to actuate the rod 6. The casing 7 is divided into two chambers 38 and 39 by an annular flexible diaphragm 35 supporting a tubular bush 36 with a central rubber disc 37. The chambers 38 and 39 each contain a sleeve 41, 42 supported on a flexible diaphragm 43 and slidable through a lip-seal 45 retained by a washer 46 to form two further chambers 47 and 48. Blocks 47a and 48a slide in bores in the sleeves 41 and 42 and limit axial movement of the latter by engagement between shoulders 49 and 50. The outer ends of the blocks 47a and 48a form seatings for disc valves 52 and 61 which are normally closed by springs 54 and 63 so that the chambers 48 and 49 are isolated from the chambers 38 and 39. The chambers 38 and 39 connect with the two servomotors and are themselves interconnected and the chambers 47 and 48 are open to atmosphere (Fig. 1, not shown). The rod 6 and another rod 57 have ball ends 58 which engage in recesses in the blocks 47a and 48a, the end of the rod 57 being supported against the wall of the casing 7. When the rod 6 is moved axially it opens the valve 61 to admit air to the chambers 38 and 48, thereby operating the servomotors. The rubber disc 37, compressed between the blocks 47a and 48a, provides "" feel "" when the rod 6 is being manually operated to apply the brakes. The master cylinder is pedaloperated. To provide power operation to assist the hand-brake a bell-crank lever 20 is pivoted to a bracket on the casing 7 at 21 engaging one end behind a shoulder 25 on the rod 6 and can be operated by a Bowden cable 30 to move the rod 6 independently of the master cylinder.",AUTOMOTIVE PROD CO LTD,BAILEY WALTER WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/085-577-105-354-308,Granted Patent,no,0,1,2,2,0,B60T13/244,B60T13/24,F2E EMB           EMB;;F2F FFB           FFBZ;;F2F F823          FFBZ;;F2F F825          FFBZ,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The system comprises an actuator (31) (e.g. a trailer brake valve) for the further braking having a plunger (32) with a range of free travel (30) before additional movement actuates the further braking. A beam (34) is rockable with respect to the plunger. Hydraulic supplies (16 and 17) which also operate the first mentioned brakes operate hydraulic actuators (35 and 36) at opposite ends of the beam (34) so that either actuator (35 or 36) can rock the beam about the other actuator and partially operate the plunger (32). A restricted gap (38) for the beam (34) limits this movement. Only when both first mentioned brakes are applied and thus both actuators (35 and 36) are operated can the beam (34) move the plunger (32) sufficiently far to actuate the further braking.,AUTOMOTIVE PROD PLC,BAILEY WALTER WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/096-774-643-736-68X,Patent Application,yes,4,2,5,5,0,B60T11/18;;B60T11/101;;B60T11/21;;B62D11/08,B60T11/10;;B60T11/18;;B60T11/21;;B60T13/12;;B62D11/08,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Switches retained set and freed mechanically; retractive switches. ASSOCIATED ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES Ltd. Dec. 18, 1964 [Feb. 21, 1964], No. 7363/64. Heading H2B. A shaft 1 carries a sleeve 23 for rotation therewith but axially independent thereof and urged axially by a spring 24 such that two notches 28 (Fig. 1, not shown) on the end face 25 co-operate with a small wheel 29 to locate the shaft 1 with a snap action in a selected one of two stable angular positions. Two springsets 6 and 7 are respectively partly actuated by shoulders such as 27 and levers such as 31 in these two stable angular positions of shaft 1. A pin 13 moving in an arcuate slot 12 in support 11a normally limits the angular movement of shaft 1 such that only certain contacts of the appropriate springset are operated. If the shaft 1 is pressed axially (against the spring 24) the pin 13 moves into an appropriate slot 16 or 17 in member 15 (shown "" exploded"") which then allows an increment of angular movement of shaft 1 to cause the remaining contacts of the appropriate springset to be operated. When shaft 1 is released the action of spring 24 retracts the shaft to its initial stable angular position. The springsets are wired to a terminal block 10 (Fig. 1, not shown) which provides an internal sliding connection to terminals 50 on the outside of a fixed casing 49 (Fig. 2, not shown) in which the switch is retained by a releasable spring catch 51, 53.",ASS ELECT IND,BARROW NORMAN;;BAILEY WALTER ROBERT,,https://lens.org/078-889-726-233-444,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H01H13/023;;H01H25/06,H01H13/02;;H01H25/06,H1N NGA           NGA;;H1N NGAB          NGAB;;H1N N442          FM;;H1N N446          FM;;H1N N446          NGAB;;H1N N45X          FM;;H1N N45Y          FM;;H1N N451          FM;;H1N N451          NGAB;;H1N N541          FM;;H1N N541          NGAB;;H1N N562          FM;;H1N N569          NGAB;;H1N N60X          FM;;H1N N60X          NGAB;;H1N N611          FM;;H1N N611          NGAB;;H1N N638          FM;;H1N N639          NGAB;;H1N N649          FM;;H1N N649          NGAB;;H1N N703          FM;;H1N N703          NGAB;;H1N N734          FM;;H1N N734          NGAB;;H1N N735          FM;;H1N N735          NGAB;;H1N N74X          FM;;H1N N74X          NGAB;;H1N N744          FM;;H1N N744          NGAB;;H1N N747          FM;;H1N N747          NGAB;;H1N N853          NGAB;;H1N N854          NGAB;;H1N N871          NGAB,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A driven member is positioned in accordance with the condition of switch means SSW by means including switching means PSW controlled by the driven member to represent the actual position, a winding II of an electromagnet 27 being energized via the switching means SSW, PSW when the desired position is reached, thus causing a latch to engage a notched wheel to prevent further movement of the driven member, the electromagnet 27 having a second winding I which is energized throughout. In a first embodiment (Figs. 1-10, not all shown), four of the above systems are provided to control a train arrival/departure time indicating device, movable belts or film 21A-D, bearing a single column of numerals each,being the driven members. Each of belts 21A-D is driven by a sprocket wheel and a toothless wheel each driven via an individual felt friction pad from a driving shaft common to all the belts. Engagement of the latch with the notched wheel in the case of any belt causes the associated two friction pads to slip. While a given belt is moving, a cam driven with it operates contacts 28, e.g. 28c, to supply stepping pulses to step switching means PSW. A number of the indicating devices described above may be mounted in a rack by pins e.g. 8, 10 (Fig. 1) and all driven by a common chain engaging sprocket wheels 13 (Fig. 1). Figs. 11-16 (only 12 shown) show a second embodiment in which an indicating device comprises a single hexagonal drum 54 comprising three detachable slats 70, each having a pin 72 to fit into one end plate of the drum, a three-fingered spring 75 (Fig. 13, not shown) supporting the other ends of the slats 70.

The method comprises measuring a plurality of peak amplitudes from a series of electrical energy pulses delivered to an electrode tip. The maximum peak value from among the plurality of peak amplitudes correlates to the contact force between the electrode tip and a workpiece. The method further comprises comparing the maximum peak value to a set point to determine an offset and optimizing the contact force according to the value of the offset. The apparatus comprises an electrode tip connected to an electrical energy wave generator and an electrical signal sensor, which connects to a high-speed data acquisition card. An actuator provides relative motion between the electrode tip and a workpiece by receiving a feedback drive signal from a processor that is operably connected to the actuator and the high-speed data acquisition card.

   A method and apparatus for controlling electrospark deposition (ESD) comprises using electrical variable waveforms from the ESD process as a feedback parameter. The method comprises measuring a plurality of peak amplitudes from a series of electrical energy pulses delivered to an electrode tip. The maximum peak value from among the plurality of peak amplitudes correlates to the contact force between the electrode tip and a workpiece. The method further comprises comparing the maximum peak value to a set point to determine an offset and optimizing the contact force according to the value of the offset. The apparatus comprises an electrode tip connected to an electrical energy wave generator and an electrical signal sensor, which connects to a high-speed data acquisition card. An actuator provides relative motion between the electrode tip and a workpiece by receiving a feedback drive signal from a processor that is operably connected to the actuator and the high-speed data acquisition card.

The torque limit is used to limit a torque command to the electric drive motors ( 210 ) such that the torque command is consistent with the operating capabilities of the engine ( 202 ).",BAILEY BRADLEY;;HENDRICKSON MATTHEW;;TATE WILLIAM J;;EARLESON WALTER E;;BRAND JEFFREY A;;CATERPILLAR INC,BAILEY BRADLEY;;HENDRICKSON MATTHEW;;TATE WILLIAM J;;EARLESON WALTER E;;BRAND JEFFREY A,CATERPILLAR INC (2008-09-11),https://lens.org/156-549-917-967-455,Granted Patent,yes,106,20,4,4,0,B60K6/46;;B60W30/184;;B60K6/46;;B60L50/51;;B60L50/51;;B60L2240/421;;B60L2240/421;;B60L2240/423;;B60L2240/423;;B60L2240/441;;B60L2240/441;;B60L2240/662;;B60L2240/662;;B60W10/06;;B60W10/06;;B60W10/08;;B60W10/08;;B60W20/00;;B60W20/00;;B60W30/1884;;B60W30/1884;;B60W50/0097;;B60W2510/0623;;B60W2510/0623;;B60W2510/0638;;B60W2510/0638;;B60W2510/081;;B60W2510/081;;B60W2540/10;;B60W2540/10;;B60W2555/20;;B60W2555/20;;B60W2710/083;;B60W2710/083;;B60Y2200/14;;B60Y2200/14;;B60Y2200/142;;B60Y2200/142;;H02P29/032;;H02P29/032;;Y02T10/62;;Y02T10/62;;Y02T10/64;;Y02T10/64;;Y02T10/70;;Y02T10/70;;Y02T10/72;;Y02T10/72;;Y02T90/16;;Y02T90/16,G05D3/00,701/22;;280/65.3,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
