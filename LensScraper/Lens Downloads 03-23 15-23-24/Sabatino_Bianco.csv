The inner shaft is disposed within the outer shaft, with a proximal end of the inner shaft extending proximally from the outer shaft. The proximal end is configured to be rotated such that rotation of the inner shaft results in simultaneous rotation of the inner and outer shafts, with rotation of the outer shaft ceasing at a first value of resistance associated with the proximal adjustment assembly and rotation of the inner shaft ceasing at a second value of resistance associated with the distal adjustment assembly such that cessation of rotation of the inner shaft is independent from cessation of rotation of the outer shaft.",K2M INC,LUDWIG STEVEN;;DHUPAR SCOTT;;BIANCO SABATINO;;ABBED KHALID;;DOPPENBERG EGON;;MOORE JENNIFER;;DONOHOE JOHN;;JONES SCOTT A;;WALLENSTEIN TODD;;VINCKIER BRAD;;FLOYD JORDAN;;LANFORD GREGORY;;O'SHAUGHNESSY BRIAN;;MORRISON THOMAS,K2M INC (2019-08-29),https://lens.org/025-845-924-273-482,Granted Patent,yes,24,0,7,7,0,A61F2/4611;;B25B23/142;;A61F2/447;;A61F2/4611;;A61F2002/4615;;A61F2002/4627;;B25B23/142;;A61F2002/4625;;A61F2002/30579;;A61F2/4425;;A61F2002/30556;;A61F2/4455;;A61B2017/0256,A61F2/46;;A61B17/02;;A61F2/30;;A61F2/44;;B25B23/142,,1,0,,,"Extended European Search Report including Written Opinion for Application No. EP19161612.7 dated Aug. 5, 2019, pp. 1-7.",ACTIVE
