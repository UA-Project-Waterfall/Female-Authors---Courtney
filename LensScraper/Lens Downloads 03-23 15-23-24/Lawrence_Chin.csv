The material produced using the present invention is high in purity and is able to exhibit superconductivity at temperatures above those obtainable by liquid nitrogen. The present invention discloses techniques for fabricating ceramic superconducting materials of the type having the general chemical formula MBa2Cu3O7-x, using an aqueous coprecipitation process. According to the teachings of the present invention, the metal components of the superconducting material are first placed in solution. The ratios of the various components are carefully chosen so that the final product has the desired stoichiometric ratio. The solution pH is adjusted by the addition of a basic solution which contains only volatile components. That is, pH is adjusted in such a manner that the pH adjustment does not leave residue of any type in the final superconducting product after the product is heated, sintered, or calcined. Accordingly, ammonium hydroxide, ammonia gas and urea are generally preferred for adjusting the pH.",GEN ATOMICS,CHIN JACK;;LIANG SAMUEL S;;WOOLF LAWRENCE D,,https://lens.org/095-886-582-138-909,Patent Application,no,0,0,4,4,0,C01G3/006;;H10N60/0772,C01G1/00;;C01G3/00;;H01B12/00;;H01B13/00;;H01L39/24,D20230228    M;;23 0272    S;;31 0123    S,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

For this type of key word spotting, modifications are made to a connected word speech recognition algorithm based on state-transitional (hidden Markov) models which allow it to recognize words from a pre-defined vocabulary list spoken in an unconstrained fashion. Statistical models of both the actual vocabulary words and the extraneous speech and background noises are created.

According to the teachings of the present invention, the metal components of the superconducting material are first placed in solution. The ratios of the various components are carefully chosen so that the final product has the desired stoichiometric ratio. The solution pH is adjusted by the addition of a basic solution which contains only volatile components. That is, pH is adjusted in such a manner that the pH adjustment does not leave residue of any type in the final superconducting product after the product is   heated, sintered, or calcined. Accordingly, ammonium hydroxide, ammonia gas and urea are generally preferred for adjusting the pH.

The material produced using the present invention is high in purity and is able to exhibit superconductivity at temperatures above those obtainable by liquid nitrogen. The present invention discloses techniques for fabricating ceramic superconducting materials of the type having the general chemical formula MBa₂Cu₃O 7-x , using an aqueous coprecipitation process. According to the teachings of the present invention, the metal components of the superconducting material are first placed in solution. The ratios of the various components are carefully chosen so that the final product has the desired stoichiometric ratio. The solution pH is adjusted by the addition of a basic solution which contains only volatile components. That is, pH is adjusted in such a manner that the pH adjustment does not leave residue of any type in the final superconducting product after the product is   heated, sintered, or calcined. Accordingly, ammonium hydroxide, ammonia gas and urea are generally preferred for adjusting the pH.

A deposition control gas composed of a suitable inert gas such as argon or a mixture of inert and reactive gases such as argon and hydrogen is introduced into the CVD reactor. Deposition control gas is preferably introduced through a restrictive opening in a gas orifice surrounding the platen interior region and exits near an edge of the substrate. The restrictive opening accommodates a uniform deposition control gas flow proximate to an edge of the substrate at a pressure greater than reactor pressure near the substrate edge. The deposition control gas substantially prevents process gas access to the substrate edge and backside. In one embodiment, the restrictive opening is formed by placing a restrictive insert within a gas groove surrounding the platen interior region.

Deposition control gas is preferably introduced through a restrictive opening in a gas orifice surrounding the platen interior region and exits near an edge of the substrate.
