STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES, Ltd. July 7, 1952, No. 16985/52. Class 40 (4). [Also in Group XL (c)] In an electrical circuit arrangement for generating a pulse train under the control of a number register, the register is initially set to store one of a predetermined set of numbers, which setting results in the opening of a static electrical gate circuit through which pulses may be passed to an output circuit; pulses are then applied simultaneously to the gate circuit, and to the register, each pulse altering the setting of the register until the register stores a number which is not one of the predetermined set of numbers, whereupon the gate circuit is closed. In this way an output pulse train is produced which bears a predetermined relation to the initial setting of the register. As described, the register is initially set to store the complement with respect to fifteen of the number of output pulses required, the pulses applied to the register each step it on one, and when the register stores fifteen the gate is closed. Register (Fig. 1). This comprises a fourstage binary counter, forming the subjectmatter of Specification 735,515, [Group XL (c)], in which each stage consists of a triggered pair, e.g. L, M. In the normal condition L, N, Q, and S are discharging and the anode voltage of each is approximately - 30 volts. Thus, none of the gate tubes G1 to G4 can fire to the first impulse pulse, which fires M and extinguishes L. The second pulse fires G1, the output pulse of which fires L and O, but is ineffective on G2 (MR1 conducting). The third pulse fires M only. The fourth pulse fires G1, which fires L and G2, the output pulse from which fires N and R. Operation continues in like manner and the input pulses set the register tubes in accordance with the binary code for each successive digit. Initially a pulse train is sent into the register to cause it to store the complement with respect to fifteen of the digit to be re-transmitted under its control, i.e. the train is from fourteen to five pulses corresponding to digits one to zero. Out-pulsing gating circuit (Fig. 2). This comprises a cold cathode tube CT which functions as a gate, to the trigger electrode of which input pulses P are applied under the control of five coincidence circuits such as MR21, MR2. The individual rectifiers of these coincidence circuits are connected to the anodes of the counter tubes (L to T, Fig. 1) in such manner that if the register is storing a number between five and fourteen, inclusive, all the rectifiers of at least one coincidence circuit are non-conducting. In such circumstances the pulse P is passed via a decoupling rectifier such as MR12 to the trigger electrode of tube CT. As each pulse P is also applied to the anode of CT, this tube will then fire and give an output pulse from its cathode. This pulse is applied to the counter to step it on, and also operates a sender tube which delivers a 66 m.sec. pulse, for example a flip-flop circuit. When the counter has been stepped on to register fifteen, at least one rectifier of each coincidence circuit is conductive so that further pulses P are ineffective to operate CT. Control circuit for resetting counter and timing the inter-digital pause (Fig. 3). If it is desired to use the counter of Fig. 1 to time the inter-digital pause it is stepped by pulses X (Fig. 3), out of phase with the P pulses, the application of which is initiated in response to the first pulse passed by CT (Fig. 2), and is stopped when the counter is set to store four. Initially the tube B (Fig. 3) is discharging and a reset connection (not shown) may be provided to fire B and set the counter to zero when switching on initially. In normal operation, however, when the counter has been stepped through zero to store four, the tubes T, Q, O and M (Fig. 1) are non-conductive and rectifiers MR33 to MR36 are biased positively from the anodes of these tubes via terminals 8 to 11 respectively. The next P pulse is then applied via R9 and R10 to the trigger electrode of G5. The sole anode supply of G5 is the P pulse source, which is disabled during the initial insertion of the number into the counter, but is now enabled. G5 therefore fires and its cathode output pulse fires B and extinguishes A, and is also applied via terminal 5 (Fig. 3) and terminals 1 to 4 (Fig. 1) to the left-hand counter tubes thus setting the counter to zero. A number is then inserted into the counter, pulse supply to CT (Fig. 2) being disabled during this process, and enabled when re-transmission of the number is required. When CT commences to pass P pulses, they are applied from its cathode to terminal 6 (Fig. 3), so that the first pulse fires A. MR31 is thus rendered non-conductive so that G6 can fire to the next X pulse. G6 then passes the X pulses from terminal 7 (Fig. 3) to the drive input lead on the left of Fig. 1 to step the counter on through fifteen to four. In that condition the cycle is restarted, B firing and resetting the counter to zero ready for the insertion of the next number. The extra five X pulses used to step the counter from fifteen to four result in the counter reaching four 550 m.secs. after CT last fired, and the next P pulse 50 m.secs. later resets the counter to zero. Allowing 66 m.secs. for the last output pulse of the preceding digit, the interdigital pause is 634 m.secs.",STANDARD TELEPHONES CABLES LTD,BRANCH MAURICE CHARLES,,https://lens.org/170-147-426-051-472,Granted Patent,no,0,0,7,7,0,G11C11/28;;G11C11/28;;H03K17/54;;H03K17/54;;H03K17/52;;H03K17/52;;H03K23/82;;H03K23/82;;H04Q1/32;;H04Q1/32;;H04Q3/42;;H04Q3/42,G11C11/28;;H03K17/52;;H03K17/54;;H03K23/82;;H04Q1/32;;H04Q3/42,G4C C1128         C1128;;H3P PHR           PHR;;H4K KBNA          KBNA;;H4K K1A2          KBNA;;H4K K1A3          KBNA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Digital electric calculating apparatus. STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES, Ltd. Dec. 20, 1951, No. 29858/51. Class 106 (1). [Also in Group XL(c)] Fig. 2 shows a storage element in which the condition to be stored is represented by a positive pulse applied at I which is of sufficient amplitude to fire the trigger electrode-cathode gap only of the gas-filled cold cathode tube V2. To verify whether the stage is in the stored condition a positive pulse is applied at P to the anode of the tube via rectifier MR1, if the tube is in the stored condition the main anode/ cathode gap fires and a positive pulse is produced at the cathode. The cathode potential is prevented from becoming more negative than -50 volts by the ""catcher"" rectifier MR2, so that until the cathode voltage rises above 50 volts the impedance of the cathode load is equal to the forward resistance of rectifier MR2. When the tube is in the stored condition and is tested the anode pulse applied at P is gated through the stage, rectifier MR2 is blocked and the cathode impedance is equal to that of resistor R2. Thus the stage has effectively a variable cathode load so that it is possible to obtain a large amplitude output pulse whilst still keeping within the operating limits of the tube. In a modification shown in Fig. 3 four storage tubes VI-V4 have their cathodes connected via rectifiers to a common load R4 and a ""catcher"" rectifier MR2: Each tube has a separate input to its trigger electrode and the ""storage"" state of a tube is tested by applying a positive pulse to its anode via rectifiers at inputs P1-P4. The circuit may be used for storage in a binary code of a single decimal digit a discharging tube representing the binary digit 1 and a non-discharging tube the digit 0 so that on testing the tubes in sequence a pulse train is developed at the output 0 which represents the binary coded value of the digit. Fig. 6 shows a stage of a binary counter in which tubes B1, B2 are connected by capacitor C2 to function as a binary pair the output "" carry pulses from which are gated through an interstage coupling tube B3, when it is rendered conductive. In a modification (Fig. 7, not shown) the "" carry"" "" pulse is taken from the cathode circuit of one tube of the binary pair. Fig. 8 shows part of a counting chain comprising two tubes having a common anode load R8 in which when an incoming pulse applied to a trigger electrode fires a tube the previously fired tube is extinguished by the voltage drop in resistor R8. The driving pulse is gated to the cathode of the previous tube via rectifier MR5 as well as to the trigger electrode of the tube to be fired.",STANDARD TELEPHONES CABLES LTD,BRANCH MAURICE CHARLES,,https://lens.org/125-609-149-010-411,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,12,0,G11C11/28;;H03K17/52;;H03B21/02;;H03K17/54,G11C11/28;;H03B21/02;;H03K17/52;;H03K17/54,G4A A1CX          L;;G4A A1C1A         L;;G4A A1C3          L;;G4A A10B          L;;G4A A8A           L;;G4C C1128         C1128;;G4D DCD           CD;;H3P PX            PX(V),0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Multi-stable-state pulse distributer circuits. STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES Ltd. Feb. 26, 1958, No. 6168/58. Class 40 (6). The Figure shows a multi-stable-state pulse distributer circuit in which the individual pulses of a pulse train applied to input IP appear sequentially at outputs 01, 02 ... ON. Cold cathode gas tube V1 is initially fired by applying a negative pulse on the reset terminal RT, the other tubes V2 ... VN are extinguished by the drop in the common load resistor R2 so that at the end of the reset pulse tube V1 alone remains fired. The positive voltage at its cathode primes thyratron T1 at its control grid so that the next positive pulse at terminal IP causes tube T1 alone to fire the positive pulse at its cathode appearing at output terminal O1 This output pulse is also applied via rectifier MR2 to the grid of cathode follower tube VA which conducts applying positive voltage to the beam tetrode tubes VB, VC. These tubes conduct heavily so that there is a large voltage drop in common load resistor R2, and tube V1 is cut off when the positive pulse on the input lead IP ends. As tube T1 is also cut off the negative voltage at its anode causes tube VA and thus tubes VB, VC to be non-conductive and the anode voltage of the cold cathode tubes V1, V2 &c., is restored. The negative voltage from the cathode of tube V1 is applied to the cathode of tube V2 which fires, the positive voltage at its cathode priming tube T2 so that the next pulse causes this tube to fire and via tubes VA, VB, VC cuts off the cold cathode tube V2. When the pulse ends thyratron T2 is cut off and the next tube (V3, not shown) is fired from tube T2. Since the chain of tubes is a closed one the process repeats itself output pulses being taken from leads O1 02 ... ON sequentially. If a fault develops in one thyratron so the pulse is not passed by it tubes VA, VB, VC will not operate and the associated cold cathode tube will remain conducting indicating the existence of a fault.",STANDARD TELEPHONES CABLES LTD,BRANCH MAURICE CHARLES;;PRINCE HENRY CHARLES,,https://lens.org/187-930-869-452-509,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H04J3/042,H04J3/04,H3P PAMM          PAMM(V),0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A fail-safe circuit comprises a core A having input windings wal . .. wa3, a shift winding wa4, a bias winding wa6 and an output winding wa5 connected in a common-emitter transistor circuit T1 via a resistance R 1 to the input winding wb1 of a second core B having an output winding wb2 and a shift winding wb3 connected in series with the bias winding wa6. Core A operates as an AND circuit for pulses on wal ... wa3 which are applied simultaneously with an opposing bias pulse (see Fig. 2), all three cores having to be pulsed to overcome the bias and set the core. The immediately following shift pulse A resets the core to cause transistor T1 to conduct, thereby setting core B. The next shift B pulse resets core B to produce an output from wb2 via transistor T2 to the next stage. If two or less of the cores wa1 . wa3 are pulsed then, since the hysteresis loop is not perfectly rectangular a short duration "" sneak "" pulse may be produced when wa4 is energized, thereby partially setting core B. In the succeeding stage this will be fed to core A during the early part of the shift B/bias pulse, but, as seen from Fig. 2, the shift A pulse is still present at this time and prevents the sneak pulse from effecting the core A. The design of the circuit ensures that in the event of any winding being open or short-circuited or any of the supplies failing or any of the cores or the transistor failing no output pulse is provided.",STANDARD TELEPHONES CABLES LTD,BRANCH MAURICE CHARLES;;LANGLOIS PETER JOHN,,https://lens.org/082-630-195-484-130,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,B61L1/20;;H03K19/16,B61L1/20;;H03K19/16,H3B B200          AF;;H3B B270          AF;;H3B B271          AF;;H3B B314          AF;;H3B B350          AF;;H3B B390          AF;;H3B B393          AF;;H3B B460          AF;;H3B B488          AF;;H3B B515          AF;;H3B B523          AF,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Automatic exchange systems. STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES, Ltd. Oct. 5, 1955, No. 28332/55. Addition to 753,357. Class 40 (4). In a code translating apparatus of the magnetic ring and threaded jumper wire type the operation of a device at one end of the wire enables the application of an operating potential to a device at the other end of the wire, so causing a small current to flow in the wire and subsequently a large increase in the current through the wire is produced to pulse the output winding of the magnetic ring. As shown, the jumper determining the code is connected between the anode of a gas valve such as T1 ... T3 and the cathode of a gas valve such as TO1 ... TO4 over a rectifier X1, the trigger electrodes (say of TO1 and T1) being primed in accordance with the code to be translated. When a start potential is applied to lead ST, VI conducts to cut off V2 which conducts again after 1¢ ms. determined by C1, R5. Conduction of V2 cuts off V3 which conducts again in a similar manner after 1¢ ms. When V2 cuts off the anode current of V4 rises steadily under control of circuit C3, R8 and the potential of lead A rises correspondingly. When V3 cuts off, power valve V5 draws heavy current to cause the potential of lead A to rise rapidly. When the potential of lead A (under the influence of V4) reaches the striking potential of TO1 the latter fires and the rise in cathode potential is applied to lead D where it operates on the grid of the cathode follower V7, the resulting rise in cathode potential causing the potential on lead C to rise, so maintaining the rectifier X1 back-biased. The rise in cathode potential of V7 is further communicated to lead B via cathode follower V6. When the potential of lead C reaches a sufficient value T1 strikes and its anode potential drops to cause X1 to conduct and a small current (limited by the anode resistor of V4) to pass through the jumper. Later, when the potential of lead A rises rapidly under the influence of V5 a large current passes through lead A and consequently through the jumper to produce the requisite output pulse. Shortly afterwards V5 and V4 cut off and the current in lead A and the jumper cease. The current in lead A is restricted by a limiter connector to the left-hand winding of transformer TR1. Since with this arrangement the potentials of leads D and C always rise and fall in a similar manner, spurious outputs due to the capacities of rectifiers X1 in other jumpers are avoided.",STANDARD TELEPHONES CABLES LTD,BRANCH MAURICE CHARLES;;MILLS RONALD GERALD,,https://lens.org/120-701-091-497-182,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,56,0,H04Q3/521;;H01J2893/007;;H04Q3/42,H04Q3/42;;H04Q3/52,H4K KBC           KBC;;H4K K1A2          KBC;;H4K K1A3          KBC;;H4K K1A9          KBC,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

An automatic exchange system is arranged to provide two (or more) separately set-up connections between inlets and outlets. As described the invention is applied to cross-point (e.g. reed-relay) systems for setting up four-wire connections between incoming and outgoing junctions. In one embodiment, Fig. 1 (not shown), ordinary subscribers' lines are connected to both sides of a switching network and a single path, for local-local or local to junction calls, is used; but for calls between incoming and outgoing four-wire junctions two separate paths for the "" go "" and "" return "" paths are set up independently by a route selector operating on a one-at-a-time basis. In a second embodiment, Fig. 2 (not shown), local subscribers are connected to one side only of a switching network having on its other side interconnecting - link circuits and for local calls a two-wire connections are effected through the network from the link to the called subscriber and from the link to the calling subscriber. Four-wire connections between junctions may be established either by using a link and establishing two four-wire connections as described above between the link and the incoming junction and between the link-and the outgoing junction. In a further embodiment, Fig. 3 (not shown), in which connections have to be established between a register connectable to the incoming side of a network and a digit sender connected to -the outgoing side of the network, a four-wire connection is first established to the outgoing junction to which a sender is then connected. Then for the duration of outgoing digit sending only, a further four-wire connection is established through the network between register and digit sender.

[Also in Group XL (c)] In a circuit comprising a plurality of eitherside-stable valve pairs arranged to count impulses on a binary basis, each impulse to be counted is fed to every valve pair so that change over of such a pair can only occur during the period occupied by the impulse. In one embodiment, Fig. 1, the left-hand gas-valves VI, V3 ... of the pairs V1, V2, V3, V4 ... are normally discharging so that gates G1, G2 ... are disabled. The first pulse fires V2 to extinguish V1 thereby enabling the tube G1 to fire momentarily on receipt of the second pulse which it passes both to V1, which refires, and to the valve pair V3, V4. In this pair V4 fires, gate G2 being unable to fire since its trigger is shunted by the discharging, of V3. V4 extinguishes V3. The next pulse changes over V1 and V2, G2 not firing because its trigger is shunted by V1. The next pulse, however, changes over V1, V2 and fires G1 to pass a pulse to fire V4 and also to enable G2 (which is now prepared by the non-conducting state of V3) so that G2 transmits the incoming, pulse over its anode to the next valve pair V5, V6; and so on. In a second embodiment. Fig. 2, the incoming pulses are applied to each valve of each pair via an associated gate circuit. An incoming pulse can only be effective on a valve pair, e.g. V5, V6, provided all the left-hand valves of the preceding pairs are cutoff. Otherwise some or all of the rectifiers MR22 ... MR25 are coriducting and the incoming pulse is shunted through V1 or V3 or both. Moreover a pulse can only be effective on a valve provided its mate is conducting, e.g. for a pulse to be effective on V4 that valve must at the time be non- conducting so that MR20 is forward biased.

[Also in Group XL (b)] An arrangement for producing pulses cyclically in a set of m x n leads comprises an m x n array of gates fed by two groups of m and n leads to which they are connected in different combinations, each gate opening when a coincidence occurs between the pulses on the leads to which it is connected. In one embodiment a multivibrator SV1, SV2, Fig. 6, delivers ¢ millisecond pulses at ¢ millisecond intervals to the amplifiers AV1, AV2 and clippers CV1, CV2, whose'output after further amplification in the cathode followers CFV1, CFV2 is applied to valve AV3 whose output consists of negative pulses which are clipped by rectifier DD2 and applied to the lead L2. The pulses are also applied to the phase inverter P1V to produce positive pulses on lead L3. Positive pulses are also fed to lead L1 from CFV2. The negative pulses on L2 step the sequence tube MCT1 to produce positive pulses on its 5 output leads in succession. When the fifth cathode is energized enabling potential is supplied to the valve CDV whose grid time constant circuit holds this potential long enough for the next positive pulse applied from L3 to cause the valve to conduct and suppress TV. Thus TV provides stepping pulses for the tube MCT2 at 1/5th of the rate of the pulses applied to L1, L2, L3. The cathodes of the tubes MCT1, MCT2 are connected to an array of 50 gas-filled valves such as TG1 in different combinations. When the valve is enabled on its two grids by potentials from the two stepping tubes it is momentarily fired by an anode pulse received over L1 to produce an output pulse on its cathode. In a second embodiment the co-ordinate array of gas tubes is replaced by an array of rectifier gates Fig. 4. For forty-nine of a master series of pulses fed over RR5 one or other or both of rectifiers DD2, DD3 are conducting to shunt the pulse, but on one pulse out of fifty, different for each of the leads 1 ... 10, both are baek-biased to permit the pulse to be fed to the output amplifier VV29, W30.

Automatic exchange systems. STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES, Ltd. Jan. 16, 1953 [Dec. 17, 1951], No. 29468/51. Class 40 (4). In a call queueing system in which calls are extended for attention in the order of their arrival a periodic check is made of the incoming lines to determine which have calls requiring to be extended for attention. Three arrangements are described. In the first, which is described below, the queue is controlled by a common circuit which displays the calls in batches to the operators and ensures that no call is dealt with unduly out of turn. The second is similar to the first, but displays one call at a time. In the third, each call is allotted a serial number which is stored in a circuit individual to the associated incoming line and only one call is displayed at a time. First arrangement. When a line incoming to a manual board is seized, contact l enables a tube Tl, whereupon a pulse in a time position characterizing the line are applied to a comparator E, from a generator C through tube T1 and gate D. The first pulse is passed over lead XY and an incoming distributer G to the first free unit of a chain of storage units F, which applies the pulse over wire Y to the comparator E to prevent further pulses in the same time position seizing another storage unit. The generator C applies a marking code characteristic of and in the time position of each line to all the storage units and in combination with the pulse applied over lead XY this effects the registration of the identity of the line in the storage unit. Assuming that the maximum number of calls is being displayed, switch L indicates the storage unit associated with the first call, counter R records the number of calls extended and counter K records the number of calls of the last batch that have been displayed and switch H indicates the storage unit associated with the call next to be displayed. When a call other than the first is attended to by an operator, contact l opens and T1 ceases to pass pulses. As a result the pulses on lead Y corresponding to the attended call are fed by the comparator E to lead YX to clear the associated storage unit and to return the counter R one step. When the first call is attended to similar operations take place and also switch L hunts for the next occupied storage unit, the call associated with it becoming the first call. Switch L resets the counter K to zero. A release control circuit J causes the storage unit indicated by switch H to pass a pulse in the time position of the associated line through gate S and tube T2 to operate relay LL which causes the call to be displayed and counters R and K step forward one step. Switch H steps on causing further calls'to be displayed until counter R indicates that the maximum number has been reached. If now calls other than the headof the queue are attended to, for each call counter R steps back, a further call is released and counters R and K step forward.

Discharge-tube circuits. STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES, Ltd. Aug. 27, 1952, No. 21543. Addition to 636,700. Class 40 (6) A circuit for indicating the state of conductivity of a discharge gap comprises a coincidence gate circuit of the type described in the parent Specification connected between an output electrode of the gap and a source of pulses so that an output pulse is produced only when the gap is in a predetermined state of conductivity or non-conductivity. The Figure shows a circuit for ""examining"" the state of conductivity of a series of cold-cathode gas discharge tubes S1-S4 upon which information is stored as indicated by the conductivity or non-conductivity of any tube. A series of positive-going pulses is applied at each of the inputs PA-PD so that a positive pulse appears at the junction of resistor R3 and rectifier MR1, which together form a coincidence gate circuit as described in the parent Specification only when the corresponding tube S1-S4 is not discharging. If the corresponding discharge tube S1-S4 is discharging no ""examining"" pulse is passed to the output terminal via rectifier MR2 and capacitor C1. Thus in dependence upon the state of tubes S1-S4 ""examining"" pulses will either be present or absent at the junctions of resistors R3 and rectifiers MR1 and if tube G1 is discharging rectifiers MR2 will be conducting to pass these pulses to the output circuit. In a modification the coincidence gate circuits MR1, R3 are connected to the cathodes of the discharge tubes S1-S4 to be tested; in this case a pulse is only passed to the output when the respective tube is discharging.

Automatic exchange systems. STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES, Ltd. Feb. 10, 1950 [Feb. 14, 1949], No. 3972/49. Class 40 (4). In a system in which a common translator may be associated temporarily with a number of registers the code digits and their translations are passed to and from the translator as coded combinations of a sequence of pulses selected from a 'regularly recurring cycle of such pulses. The pulses are also used for identifying a register calling for a translator each register being associated with a particular one of these pulses. The sequence of pulses is also used to time and control the various operations of the register after the manner of a sequence switch. The translator may preselect a calling register while the translator is passing a translation to another register. As described, 50 positive pulses PI ... P50 are used of which P1 ... P48 may be used for register identification. These may be generated as described in Specification 735,508. Seizure of register and registration of digits. The register is seized in known manner whereupon impulsing relay AE operates and fires tube T2 which operates BE and extinguishes the normally conducting tube T1. Tube T3 is extinguished during each impulse and C1 then charges slowly but discharges quickly each time T3 refires so that T1 does not fire and BE remains operated. In an alternative circuit BE is held in the anode circuit of valve V1 which is biased to conduction by condenser C4 which charges rapidly over rectifier D1 but discharges slowly over resistance R4. Tube T4 is also fired by P14 or P24 when AE operates but C4 discharges over rectifier D4 at the beginning of the first impulse and cannot recharge during impulsing so that T4 is extinguished during the reception of each digit. Relay BE connects up dial tone and also H.T. to tubes in the register among which T5 is caused to fire the resulting pulse firing T109, T7 and T33 thus establishing correct initial operating conditions for their circuits. T5 also fires T120, T123 in the timing circuit, Fig. 5, which then proceeds to count off 7 impulses after which T121, T123 are cut off so permitting the transmission of the first digit of the translation as described subsequently. Pulse P24 is passed by T4 and T6 to zeroize the receiving binary counting chain T10 ... T17. The counting chain then registers the first received digit. Tubes T7 ... T9, T18 are arranged so as to absorb an initial digit of value "" 1."" The first impulse of the digit ignites T8 and extinguishes T7 which blocks T6 to prevent the subsequent transmission of pulse P24. If the digit is "" 1 "" when T4 conducts at the end of the digit it passes pulse P14 via T19, T20 to refire T7 and extinguish T8. Since T9 is not fired T21 of the "" in sequence counting chain does not fire. Tube T4 then passes pulse P24 via T6 to reset the counting chain T10 ... T17. If the digit is "" 2 "" or more T9 also fires to enable P14 to fire T21 at the end of the digit. Tube T18 fires in parallel with T9 to bring up relay DT which disconnects dial tone and starts the impulse generator. When T21 fires it produces a pulse which is applied to the triggers of tubes T28 ... T31 ... of the storage set SA, and those tubes receiving enabling bias from such of tubes T10, T12, T14, T16 as are non-conducting fire to store the digit. Pulse P24 then passes through T4 and T6 to reset the counting chain and subsequent digits are received in a similar manner and transferred to storage groups SB, SC and S1 ... S4 under control of the distributing chain T21 ... T27 which advances one step at each pulse P14, passed by T20. Connection of translator and translation of office code. At the end of the third digit T23 fires T32 and T33 is extinguished. Tube T34 is thereby permitted to pass the pulse PA characteristic of the register to the connector circuit, Fig. 16, to cut off valve V2, the resulting anode pulse being passed via R3, V4 and gated by pulse PA through one of the networks R27 ... C12. These networks prevent permanent seizure of the connector circuit by the continuous emission of pulses from a faulty register since after a short period C11 charges up and prevents the passage of further pulses. Normally a single pulse is passed and after reshaping by V5, V6 passes via V7 and lead L to all the registers and also to T35 which fires to block V2 to pulses from other registers. The pulse is gated by pulse PA to fire T36 in the appropriate register. T36 then passes pulse P48 to fire T33, T37 and T32 is extinguished. T33 prevents T34 from passing further pulses PA to the connector circuit. T37 back-biases rectifiers D22, D23 (which otherwise shunt the signal paths to the grids of V10, V11) and enable the office code and its translation to pass to and from the translator. Valve B12 conducts between pulses P49, P1 to extinguish T35 in the connector circuit and T36 in the register. Pulses P1 ... P4 are applied to storage tubes T28 ... T31 and such of these as are fired pass the pulses via V10, V12 and V13 to the translator which gates them in by pulses P1 ... P4 to fire a combination of T39, T41 ... T45 similar to that of T28 ... T31. Such of T39, T41 ... T45 as fire extinguish their normally conducting mates T38 ... T44. The stored number is then decoded into the decimal system by the arrangement of rectifiers D38 ... D41 which allows the biasing of only one of the ten leads leading to the triggers of tubes T51 to T60. The second and third digits are fed to similar storage devices (not shown) under control of pulses P5 ... P8 and P9 ... P12 which in turn translate the digits into decimal form and bias the triggers of a tube in each of the sets T61 ... T70 and T71 .... T80. Immediately prior to the sending of the digits the register sends a pulse P50 which fires T46 and extinguishes T47 to allow pulse P17 to fire T48 and extinguish T49. The drop in anode voltage of T47 causes the anode voltage of V17 to rise and this rise is passed via V18 and V19 to fire the three valves of T51 ... T80 whose triggers are biased. Thus if the office code was 326 tubes T53, T62 and T76 are fired. For each translation to be made there is provided a tube such as T81 arranged so as to fire only when biased from the cathodes of all three of its associated tubes. The anode of T81 is pulsed by a combination of pulses selected from P18 ... P42 representing the binary codes of 6 routing digits. These pulses are repeated by V14, V15 and V16 to the register where they are admitted by V11 to set storage sets SR1 ... SR6 under control of pulses P18 ... P41. At the end of the translation pulse P43 is transmitted over V16 to the register and also to T49 which extinguishes T48. Valve V17 is thereby caused to conduct, its fall in anode volts passing via V18, V19 to extinguish T51 ... T80, and so disable the translator tubes such as T81. The storage sets T38 ... T41 are reset by pulse P18. In the connector circuit the cross-connected pair B14, B15 changes over for the period between pulses P45, P47 to reduce the output of V9 thereby extinguishing T37 in the register. The connector is now conditioned for connecting the translator to a second register which may have been preselected by its pulse PA during the transmission of the routing digits from the translator to the first register. Arrangements are described where more than 48 registers are used in which the circuit of Fig. 16 is switched at a rate of 20 c.p.s. between two circuits of the type shown in Fig. 6. Outward transmission by the register. The "" end of translation "" pulse P43 received from the translator is gated in by rectifier D52 and fires T101 and T86 of the out-sequence chain T86 ... T96. The latter biases rectifier D57 to permit such of pulses P32, P34 ... P38 as are connected to fired tubes in the set T82 ... T85 to pass via tube T104 to tube T105. Pulse P25 zeroizes the counting chain T112 ... T119 and fires T 107 (which was originally extinguished when P13 fired T108) thereby biasing T105 to permit it to pass the digit pulses P32, P34 ... P38 to the counting chain, which is thus set to a number complementary with respect to 15 to that stored on T82 ... T85.. T110, fired by the train of code pulses, extinguishes T109 and prevents T111 and T107 from being fired by further pulses P25 until the first routing digit has been sent. Meanwhile P12 from T106 has fired T87 in the out-sequence chain but P13 fires T108 to prevent T105 passing the next routing digit from SR2 and to prevent T106 passing further pulses P12 to the out-sequence chain. 10 i.p.s. pulses connected by dt1 pass via tube T126 (enabled by the present state of the counting chain, Fig. 5) to the counting chain T112 ... T119 and also to tube T127 which operates relay AG to repeat the pulses to the first code selector. The setting of the counting chain to "" 15 "" causes a pulse, developed over R88, to fire T109 to disable T126 so stopping the out-impulsing. The pulse over R88 is also applied to start the counting circuit T120 ... T125 which disables tube T126 while it counts off seven pulses to provide the inter-digital pause. T126 may also be disabled by the operation of the polarized relay DD over the outgoing line to delay the sending of further impulses until the distant switching equipment is ready to receive them. Meanwhile T109 extinguishes T110 to enable T111 to pass P25 to reset the counting chain. Pulse P25 also fires T107 which extinguishes T108 to enable T105 to transmit the next digit from SR2 to the counting chain and so on. If the translation consists of less than 6 digits, when the last of these has been transmitted T110 is not fired from the "" empty "" storage units so that T126 does not fire and transmit any more digits and successive pulses P12 are gated by T106 to step the out-sequence chain until T92 thereof is fired and T102 in parallel with it. This prevents further "" skipping "" of unregistered digits in case the subscriber has bee",STANDARD TELEPHONES CABLES LTD,HARTLEY GEORGE CLIFFORD;;BRAY FREDERICK HARRY;;BRANCH MAURICE CHARLES,,https://lens.org/099-921-003-052-702,Granted Patent,no,0,0,7,7,0,H04M3/523;;H04Q3/42;;H04M3/523;;H04Q3/42,H04M3/523;;H04Q3/42,H4K KCT           KCT;;H4K K1A2          KCT;;H4K K1A3          KCT;;H4K K1L           KCT,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The guide sleeve is seated adjacent the disc space with the longitudinal opening positioned opposite the dural region of the spine to provide a working channel to the disc space. A cutting tool is then inserted through the guide sleeve to remove tissue and bone laterally extending into the interior of the guide sleeve through the longitudinal opening, but only as much as necessary for passage of the spinal implant.

Multi-stable state discharge tube circuits. STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES, Ltd. Aug. 11, 1952, No. 20148/52. Addition to 677,872. Class 40 (6) A counting chain of gas-filled discharge tubes comprises a coincidence gate circuit between each pair of consecutive tubes in the chain each gate interconnecting the anode of the first tube of a pair, the trigger electrode of the second tube and the common lead to which triggering pulses are applied so that the second tube fires only when the discharge of the first tube and a triggering pulse on the common lead occur simultaneously. Fig. 1 shows a section of a counting chain comprising cold-cathode gas-filled discharge tubes T1-T3 in which positive-going triggering pulses are applied simultaneously to all the stages from terminal P. If tube TI is initially discharging then its anode potential is low so that when a positive pulse appears at P rectifier MR1 conducts and a positive pulse is applied to trigger tube T2. When the tube T2 fires tube T1 is extinguished by the action of the commutating capacitor C2. The next trigger pulse at P advances the discharge from tube T2 to tube T3. Rectifier MR2 limits the maximum triggering pulse amplitude at P to some 130 volts and on each occasion when tube T3 fires rectifier MR5 conducts to pass the next triggering pulse from P to the output O. In a modification shown in Fig. 2, the firing of all of the tubes of the chain on switching on the H.T. supply is prevented by biasing the trigger electrode of each tube negatively via a resistor R6 and via an earthed rectifier MR6 so that normally the trigger electrode is maintained at or near earth potential. When the H.T. supply is switched on rectifier MR6 is biased to its high resistance state and spurious firing of the tube is prevented. In a further modification shown in Fig. 3 positive triggering pulses are applied at PB and negative triggering pulses at AP in synchronism. Information is inserted in the circuit by firing or not firing predetermined tubes of the chain by means not shown, and the pattern so stored is progressed one tube along the chain by each combination of a positive and negative pulse pair applied at AP and PB in synchronism.

STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES, Ltd. Oct. 8, 1948, No. 26288. [Class 40 (iii)] [Also in Group XL (c)] An electric oscillator comprises a frequency determining circuit, a source of direct current having a maximum value corresponding to the maximum value of the alternating current produced by the oscillator, means for passing the direct current through a part of the frequency determining circuit to stop the oscillator, and means for disabling the source of direct current in order to bring the oscillator into operation at a fixed point in the alternating current cycle. As shown, the oscillator comprises a pentode valve 1 having the primary 3 of a transformer connected in its anode circuit and one side of the tuned circuit consisting of secondary 4 shunted by a capacitor 9 connected through resistors 7 and 8 to the control grid, the other side being connected direct to the cathode. A valve 10 using a low anode voltage is connected across the tuned circuit and is arranged to pass a current corresponding to the maximum alternating current produced by the oscillator, this stopping the oscillator. To start the oscillator the valve 10 is biassed to cut-off as by taking the potential from the anode of a control valve rendered conductive or a relay switching the required potential from a suitable source, and the direct current through the coil 4 begins to decay building up a potential across the coil 4 which is equivalent to one half-cycle of the oscillator alternating current, the oscillator then continuing to function in the normal manner. Pulses may be produced by arranging that the grid voltage overswings violently the oscillator valve to produce a substantially square waveform which may be passed through a differentiating circuit to produce a succession of positive or negative pulses, the unwanted pulses being eliminated as by rectifiers. The oscillator may also be arranged to stop at the correct point on the cycle by arranging that the control valve is operated under the control of pulses generated by the oscillator. In an alternative arrangement, Fig. 2 (not shown), the principle is applied to a resistance-capacity oscillator.",STANDARD TELEPHONES CABLES LTD,GOULD WILLIAM FREDERICK;;BRANCH MAURICE CHARLES;;BROOKS LESLIE JAMES;;KING PETER MORRIS,,https://lens.org/101-295-178-633-984,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H04L25/45,H04L25/45,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Code-telegraphy; thermionic valve and like distributers. STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES, Ltd. Nov. 8, 1949 [Oct. 8, 1948], No. 26287/48. Class 40 (iii). [Also in Group XL (c)] In a telegraph transmitter for mark-space signal combinations, the combination is set up by firing appropriate ones of pairs of cold-cathode discharge tubes, the voltage wave representing the signal combination being generated in dependence of the particular tubes rendered conducting and upon the operation of a distributer chain of cold-cathode discharge tubes fired in regular timed sequence by a source of timing impulses. In Fig. 1, the code combination set up on five contacts 6-10 is transferred to five twocondition devices 1-5 upon closure of a contact 12. Each device comprises a pair of cold-cathode discharge tubes T1 (space) and T2 (mark) interconnected with a common anode load R4 so that the firing of one tube extinguishes the other. Initially the devices are all set with the mark tube conducting and the circuits extending through the closed contacts of the series 6-10 cause selected space tubes to fire. Simultaneously with the closing of contact 12, a contact 14 sets into operation a distributer comprising a chain of cold-cathode tubes T3-T10 so interconnected and having a common anode load R6 that the firing of one tube extinguishes the preceding tube and primes the succeeding tube. A source of 1 millisecond pulses operating at a frequency of 50 per second is applied via condensers C4 to trigger the tubes in sequence, the circuit to the first tube T3 extending through contact 14. The voltage variation representing the signal combination appears on line 15 which is given a steady marking potential unless a space is transmitted. As each distributer tube fires its cathode potential raises the bias on a rectifier X3 and allows the potential at the cathode of the space tube of the associated twocondition device to appear on line 15. In this manner, dependent on the combination of space tubes fired, mark or space potentials in accordance with the code set up on contacts 6-10 appear in sequence on line 15. A connection through rectifier X1 from the first tube T3 provides the start space signal. The twocondition devices are reset at the end of the signal with mark tubes conducting by connections extending from the pulse generator via condensers C6 and from distributer tube T9 via rectifier X4. The last tube of the distributer T10 is connected through resistance R8 to condition the first tube T3 to fire again and restart operations upon subsequent closure of contacts 12 and 14. Owing to the presence of CR networks in the cathodes of the various tubes, the voltage variation on line 15 is in the form of a series of exponential impulses. A valve relay circuit (see Group XL (c)) comprising valves V1-V5 converts these impulses into square-topped impulses which appear on mark and space lines 16, 17. Valves V3 and V4 are connected as a direct coupled "" flip-flop "" circuit and are triggered from one condition to the other by impulses from the 50-cycle/sec. source under the control of values V1 and V5 in dependence of the impulses on line 15 which are applied to the grid of valve V2. In a modified transmitter, Fig. 2 (not shown), the tubes T4-T8 of the distributer are each replaced by a pair of tubes, one tube being controlled by the mark tube of the corresponding two-condition device and the other by the space tube. The distributer is triggered in sequence as in Fig. 1 but with only one tube of each pair firing as determined by the setting of the twocondition devices. The mark tubes of the distributer pairs connect with one output line and the space tubes with another line. In this manner the mark and space elements of the transmitted signal appear on separate lines.

Each radio signal comprises a plurality of subchannels (806). The radio signal from each branch (108, 214) is digitized (904) into digital samples that are converted (908, 910) into frequency domain signals (702, 712). Each frequency domain signal (702, 712) corresponds to a subchannel and a branch (108, 214). A weighting factor is determined (916) for each branch (108, 214) and each subchannel (806) from instantaneous signal energy and noise power calculated (912, 914) from the frequency domain signals (702, 712). The frequency domain signal (702, 712) corresponding to each branch (108, 214) and each subchannel (806) is multiplied (918) by the weighting factor therefor to produce weighted frequency domain signals corresponding to each branch and each subchannel. The weighted frequency domain signals that correspond to all the branches (108, 214) of each subchannel (806) are then combined (920) to produce a diversity-combined frequency domain signal for each subchannel (806).",MOTOROLA INC,LIBERTI JOSEPH CHARLES JR;;AYERST DOUGLAS IRVIN;;BRANCH TONY RANDAL;;CARSELLO STEPHEN ROCCO,,https://lens.org/038-041-214-211-162,Patent Application,yes,3,18,2,2,0,H04B7/0857;;H04L1/02;;H04B7/0857;;H04L1/02,H04B7/08;;H04L1/02,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The resonator Q can be increased without increasing the impedance or insertion loss by storing many cycles or wavelengths in the high-Q resonator material, with much lower damping than the piezoelectric transducer material.",OLSSON ROY H;;EL-KADY IHAB F;;ZIAEI-MOAYYED MARYAM;;BRANCH DARREN W;;SU MEHMET F;;REINKE CHARLES M;;SANDIA CORP,OLSSON ROY H;;EL-KADY IHAB F;;ZIAEI-MOAYYED MARYAM;;BRANCH DARREN W;;SU MEHMET F;;REINKE CHARLES M,NATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS OF SANDIA LLC (2010-05-25),https://lens.org/133-499-524-410-691,Granted Patent,yes,7,43,1,1,0,H03H9/02228;;H03H9/02228,H03H9/54,333/187;;310/324,12,6,186-688-627-912-200;;115-535-432-660-098;;178-091-212-271-42X;;096-794-732-129-281;;036-466-125-178-20X;;082-695-813-687-283,10.1109/ultsym.1990.171417;;10.1109/memsys.2008.4443596;;10.1109/memsys.2007.4432960;;10.1109/freq.1993.367467;;10.1109/freq.2008.4623077;;10.1109/jmems.2006.889503,"Fleming, ""Microfabricated Bulk Wave Acoustic Bandgap Device,"" U.S. Appl.
