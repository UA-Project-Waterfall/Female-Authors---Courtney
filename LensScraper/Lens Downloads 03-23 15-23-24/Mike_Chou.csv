A transport means is provided to move carriers (63) which carry integrated circuit packages (61) with or without integrated circuits. An ink printing machine is used to apply a first color pattern through a first pattern symbol plate (73) onto the surface of said integrated circuit packages (63). An in line ink curing machine (77) is used to cure the ink pattern. A second color of ink is applied by a second ink printing machine onto said integrated circuit package. A second ink curing machine is then used to cure said second ink pattern. By repeating this ink color printing and curing cycle, using a separate pattern mask for each color, any desired pattern may be created on the integrated circuit package. The pattern may include trademarks, trade names, logos, advertising slogans, alphabetic and numeric characters, and machine readable patterns.

The anode and cathode plates are designed to form hydrogen and air channels that allow for uniform distribution and even flow of hydrogen and air through the channels with the channels of each particular plate having substantially identical length in order to enhance electrochemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen contained in the air with respective catalysts in the fuel cell stack. Also a sufficient amount of air is allowed to flow through the cathode plate to enhance output power of the fuel cell stack.

   A water draining structure for gas reaction plate of a fuel cell stack includes a gas inlet, a gas outlet, a plurality of wide gas channels parallelly arranged to communicate with the gas inlet, and a plurality of narrow gas channel parallelly arranged to communicate with the gas outlet, all provided on the gas reaction plate. Each of the wide gas channels is communicable with a corresponding one of the narrow gas channels. When an amount of reacting gas is guided into the gas reaction plate, it encounters a significant change in cross-section area from the wide gas channels to the narrow gas channels. A substantial pressure difference between the wide and narrow gas channels is generated, providing a force to blow off moisture in the wide and narrow gas channels.

A performing procedure of the impulse-like gesture recognition method includes steps of: receiving a sensing signal from a sensing unit; determining a prediction with at least one impulse-like label according to the sensing frames by a deep learning-based model; and classifying at least one gesture event according to the prediction. The gesture event is classified to determine the motion of the user. Since the at least one impulse-like label is used to label at least one detection score of the deep learning-based model, the detection score is non-decreasing, reaction time of the at least one gesture event for an incoming gesture is fast, rapid consecutive gestures are easily decomposed, and an expensive post-processing is not needed.",KAIKUTEK INC,WANG MIKE CHUN-HUNG;;KUO CHUN-HSUAN;;HWANG WEN-JYI;;WU GUAN-SIAN;;WU CHIEH;;CHOU WEN-YEN;;WU YU-FENG;;LI FANG;;CHANG WEN-YEN,KAIKUTEK INC (2020-10-19),https://lens.org/050-176-064-485-821,Granted Patent,yes,18,0,2,2,0,G01S7/417;;G01S7/415;;G06N3/08;;G01S7/415;;G01S7/417;;G06N20/00,G01S7/41;;G01S13/00;;G06N20/00,,3,2,071-524-422-589-699;;029-423-156-393-574,10.1109/access.2019.2938725;;10.1109/access.2020.3037062,"Paul E.
