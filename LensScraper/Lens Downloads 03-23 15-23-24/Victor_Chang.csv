Each section has a rotor mounted on the power shaft, with six evenly spaced radial vanes slidably carried thereby and being slidably and sealingly engageable with the inside surfaces of the associated section. A fuel intake duct is connected to the first section, which accomplishes fuel admission and compression strokes. A port in a partition wall admits compressed fuel into the second section, which has spark plugs for igniting the compressed fuel. The second section provides expansion and exhaust strokes. The gaseous products of combustion leave through an exhaust duct connected to the second section. The third section defines an air blower whose output is connected to the second section by a transfer duct, discharging into the exhaust region of the second section and exerting scavenging action on the gaseous products of combustion discharging through the exhaust duct.

Each PCW represents one and only one ideogram and provides the full sound and tone information required to pronounce it. Ambiguities caused by homonyms and homotones are avoided. PCL words are translated into their corresponding ideograms and vice versa by means of a stored monosyllabic dictionary. A method for unambiguously separating a polysyllabic PCL character string into separate words is also provided, which makes it unnecessary to employ a polysyllabic dictionary. Also disclosed is a method of forming an alphagrammic listing from PCL character strings by separating the strings into separate characters and listing them in alphabetical order, provided that homotones and identical ideograms are grouped together even if strict alphabetical ordering of the string would have separated them.

Generally, the method entails altering the index of refraction of an optical medium (14) through which the pulse of light is traveling at an area of the medium (14) where the front end of the pulse of light is located, such that the front end of the pulse of light travels slower than the back end, thus enabling the back end to catch up with the front end in order to shorten the length of the pulse. To accomplish this, it is proposed to generate an electric field across the optical medium (14) by a charge carrying medium (12) positioned relative to the optical medium (14), such that the index of refraction is altered by the electro-optic effect. In addition, it is possible to alter the index of refraction of the optical medium (14) by surrounding the optical medium (14) with a piezoelectric material (20) and applying an electric field to the piezoelectric material (20) such that the piezoelectric material (20) compresses the optical medium (14), thus altering the index of refraction.",HUGHES AIRCRAFT CO,CHANG DAVID B;;VALI VICTOR,,https://lens.org/162-020-530-924-028,Patent Application,yes,0,0,5,5,0,G02F1/0134;;G02F1/0134;;G02F1/035;;G02F1/035;;G02F2203/26;;G02F2203/26;;H01S3/0057;;H01S3/0057,G02F1/01;;G02F1/035;;G02F2/00;;H01S3/00;;H01S3/10,,5,5,020-855-628-847-346;;126-024-813-643-739;;041-318-182-675-401;;039-673-688-799-019;;050-966-442-345-76X,10.1364/ol.15.001023;;19770986;;10.1063/1.99181;;20490124;;10.1364/ao.26.003687;;10.1364/ol.14.000782;;19752966;;10.1109/3.135,"OPTICS LETTERS. vol. 15, no. 18, 15 September 1990, NEW YORK US pages 1023 - 1025 Q.Z.

Generally, the method entails altering the index of refraction of an optical medium (14) through which the pulse of light is traveling at an area of the medium (14) where the front end of the pulse of light is located, such that the front end of the pulse of light travels slower than the back end, thus enabling the back end to catch up with the front end in order to shorten the length of the pulse. To accomplish this, it is proposed to generate an electric field across the optical medium (14) by a charge carrying medium (12) positioned relative to the optical medium (14), such that the index of refraction is altered by the electro-optic effect. In addition, it is possible to alter the index of refraction of the optical medium (14) by surrounding the optical medium (14) with a piezoelectric material (20) and applying an electric field to the piezoelectric material (20) such that the piezoelectric material (20) compresses the optical medium (14), thus altering the index of refraction.",HUGHES AIRCRAFT CO,CHANG DAVID B;;VALI VICTOR,,https://lens.org/052-363-690-475-862,Patent Application,no,0,0,5,5,0,G02F1/0134;;G02F1/0134;;G02F1/035;;G02F1/035;;G02F2203/26;;G02F2203/26;;H01S3/0057;;H01S3/0057,G02F1/01;;G02F1/035;;G02F2/00;;H01S3/00;;H01S3/10,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The system also receives modules that are individually designed to this system specification. The system then compares the modules with the system specification to identify nonfunctioning modules that can include either missing modules or incorrect modules. The system also determines an interface for the nonfunctioning modules from the system specification, which specifies input and output requirements for these nonfunctioning modules. The system then generates the simulation module. This simulation module can function in place of the nonfunctioning module and can simulate a functionality assigned to the nonfunctioning module.

    One embodiment of the present invention provides a system that facilitates generating a simulation module for testing a system design. The system operates by receiving a system specification, which specifies correct behavior for modules within the system design. The system also receives modules that are individually designed to this system specification. The system then compares the modules with the system specification to identify nonfunctioning modules that can include either missing modules or incorrect modules. The system also determines an interface for the nonfunctioning modules from the system specification, which specifies input and output requirements for these nonfunctioning modules. The system then generates the simulation module. This simulation module can function in place of the nonfunctioning module and can simulate a functionality assigned to the nonfunctioning module.

Reflections from the upper and lower surfaces of the phosphate layer return a total reflected intensity which is a function of the optical parameters of the phosphate components and the ratio of the components corresponding to the optical parameters. In the event, for example, that a phosphate layer includes two zinc phosphate components, the measure of reflected intensity at two separate wavelengths will be different inasmuch as the optical properties of the zinc phosphate components is also a function of frequency. The measured reflected intensity and its functional dependence upon the ratio of the components within the phosphate layer can be taken together with the known values of the optical parameters of each component to compute the fraction of each component within the phosphate layer.

The invention provides an electrooptical means for scanning an optical beam or moving an optical storage or retrieval point. Beam movement is achieved electrooptically, by changing the index of refraction of an electrooptical material by controlling electric fields applied thereto. A plurality of electrodes are disposed on one surface of the electrooptic material and a ground electrode is disposed on the other. The electrodes are adapted to apply electric fields derived from a voltage source to the electrooptic material that selectively changes its index of refraction and provides for a predetermined index of refraction profile along at least one dimension thereof, thus forming a lens. By appropriately forming the electrode pattern and properly controlling the voltages applied thereto, differing lens shapes may be formed.

The sensor employs an eccentric core optical fiber fully immersed in the liquid to be measured. Light is injected into one end of the fiber. Some of the light will be lost due to evanescent wave losses. Changes in the ratio of the intensity of the input light and the reflected light are due solely to changes in the density of the liquid. Changes in the liquid density can then be used to compensate a liquid level measurement. Since the liquid temperature is related to its density, the sensor can also be used to measure changes in the liquid temperature.",HUGHES AIRCRAFT CO,CHANG DAVID B;;VALI VICTOR;;PEARSON KEITH V;;LAWRENCE ALBERT F,OL SECURITY LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY (2012-07-30);;HUGHES AIRCRAFT COMPANY A CORP.

Beam movement is achieved electrooptically, by changing the index of refraction of an electrooptical material by controlling electric fields applied thereto. A plurality of electrodes are disposed on one surface of the electrooptic material and a ground electrode is disposed on the other. The electrodes are adapted to apply electric fields derived from a voltage source to the electroopic material that selectively change its index of refraction and provides for a predetermined index of refraction profile along at least one dimension thereof, thus forming a lens. By appropriately forming the electrode pattern and properly controlling the voltages applied thereto, differing lens shapes may be formed. Since the response times of the electrooptic materials employed in the present invention are on the order of nanoseconds (10.sup.-9 sec) or less, the intrinsic response frequency of the lens system is 10.sup.9 Hz or more. The present invention thus increases the data storage and retrieval capacity of optical systems in which it is employed.",HUGHES AIRCRAFT CO,VALI VICTOR;;CHANG DAVID B;;SHIH I-FU;;YOUMANS BRUCE R,HUGHES AIRCRAFT COMPANY A CORP.

The system incorporates a gamma or X-ray source for irradiating the body with gamma rays to produce X-ray fluorescence of materials contained therein. A direc­tionally discriminate X-ray detector is positioned to intercept X-rays emitted from the body and is adapted to pass only those X-rays having a predetermined wavelength and incident from a specific direction that are characteristic of a material of interest contained in the body. The detector includes a dislocation free single crystal having substantially parallel input and output surfaces. A second crystal aligned parallel to the first crystal may be disposed at a position offset from the first crystal to receive the X-rays transmitted by the first crystal in order to discriminate between materials fluorescing within the body. In a specific embodiment of the invention, the first de­tector comprises an elongated crystal which pass X-rays in accordance with the Bor­rmann effect. A plurality of the crystals are arranged in a linear array and the con­tainer is either scanned with the array or the container passed linearly past the array. The detected X-rays are measured in intensity and the data is processed by suitable data processor to generate a video image indicative of the presence and shape of the specific materials for which the system is adapted. In yet another specific embodi­ment of the invention, a plurality of such arrays can be arranged with the input sur­faces of the crystals disposed at different Bragg angles to simultaneously detect the presence of a selected group of materials.

A feedback voltage is compared to a primary-side voltage sensed from the primary current loop to turn the switch on and off. A multiplier loop generates the feedback voltage using a multiplier.

In one embodiment, the screen is a transparent glass cylinder which is covered by a thin, transparent, conductive layer of tin oxide. In another embodiment, the electrostatic screen is a conductive, transparent tin-oxide coating with is applied either to the inside or the outside surface of a light-transmitting covering which surrounds the discharge tube. The tin-oxide layer is not continuous, in order to minimise currents induced in the conductive tin-oxide layer by the induction coil. The thickness of the tin-oxide layer is sufficient to make it conductive and to form an approximate equipotential surface, as a result of which the discharge tube and the plasma discharge are screened from intensive electrical fields, this reducing the damage to the discharge-tube wall and increasing the service life of the lamp. In addition, the tin oxide acts as an infrared reflector which guides the infrared radiation back into the discharge tube, thus leading to a higher efficiency. Other advantages of the electrostatic screen include: a lower colour temperature, further improved efficiency and a reduced formation rate of free iodine in lamps which use metal iodide fillings, thus further reducing the wall damage. <IMAGE>",GEN ELECTRIC,SOMMERER TIMOTHY JOHN;;CHANG HSUEH-RONG;;KLEIN III ARTHUR;;ROBERTS VICTOR DAVID;;WITTING HARALD LUDWIG;;FARRALL GEORGE ALBERT,,https://lens.org/108-273-296-705-931,Patent Application,no,0,4,3,3,0,H01J61/35;;H01J61/35;;H01J1/50;;H01J1/50;;H01J61/04;;H01J61/04;;H01J61/125;;H01J61/125;;H01J65/048;;H01J65/048,H05B41/24;;H01J1/50;;H01J61/04;;H01J61/12;;H01J61/35;;H01J65/00;;H01J65/04,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

In one embodiment, the shield is a transparent glass cylinder coated with a thin, transparent, conductive layer of tin oxide. In another embodiment, the electrostatic shield is a conductive, transparent tin oxide coating applied to either the inner or outer surface of an outer light-transmissive jacket surrounding the arc tube. The tin oxide layer is discontinuous so as to minimize currents induced in the conductive tin oxide layer by the induction coil. The thickness of the tin oxide layer is sufficient to make it conductive and form an approximately equipotential surface, thereby shielding the arc tube and plasma discharge from intense electric fields, reducing arc tube wall damage and increasing lamp life. In addition, tin oxide functions as an infrared reflector which returns infrared radiation to the arc tube, resulting in higher efficacy. Other advantages of the electrostatic shield include: a lower color temperature, further improving efficacy; and a lower rate of free iodine formation in lamps employing metal iodide fills, further reducing wall damage.",GEN ELECTRIC,SOMMERER TIMOTHY J;;CHANG HSEUH-RONG;;KLEIN III ARTHUR;;ROBERTS VICTOR D;;WITTING HARALD L;;FARRALL GEORGE A,GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY (1993-09-30),https://lens.org/079-687-349-549-179,Granted Patent,yes,2,26,3,3,0,H01J61/35;;H01J61/35;;H01J1/50;;H01J1/50;;H01J61/04;;H01J61/04;;H01J61/125;;H01J61/125;;H01J65/048;;H01J65/048,H05B41/24;;H01J1/50;;H01J61/04;;H01J61/12;;H01J61/35;;H01J65/00;;H01J65/04,313/489;;313/635;;313/607;;313/234;;313/313;;315/85;;315/248,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A primary-side control circuit can use either a Quasi-Resonant (QR) or a Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM) control loop to switch primary current through the transformer on and off. A feedback voltage is compared to a primary-side voltage sensed from the primary current loop to turn the switch on and off. A multiplier loop generates the feedback voltage using a multiplier. A level-shift inverter and a low-pass filter act as the multiplier by multiplying an off duty cycle of the switch by the feedback voltage to generate a filtered voltage. A high-gain error amp compares the filtered voltage to a reference voltage to generate the feedback voltage.

   The present invention describes a method and an apparatus for waiving noise violations during semiconductor integrated circuit design. The noise violations in a circuit area (e.g., an individual cell, block of cells or the like) are identified using a threshold look-up table. The threshold look-up table includes different thresholds for each circuit area. The threshold look-up table is generated using various cell related information including practical noise handling limits of each cell that can be higher than traditional noise limits. The information in the threshold look-up table helps eliminate benign noise violations and a new noise report is generated. The new noise report incorporates the practical noise handling capabilities of the cell under analysis and identifies actual noise violations in the semiconductor integrated circuit.

The clock sequences a counter that drives a digital count value to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The DAC outputs a sawtooth wave with a wide voltage swing. A subtractor scales down the voltage swing to produce a reduced-swing sawtooth wave which is used as an upper limit voltage. Comparators trigger a set-reset latch to toggle the clock when current pumps charge and discharge a capacitor beyond voltage limits. Since the upper limit voltage is the reduced sawtooth wave from the subtractor, the amount of time to charge the capacitor varies, dithering the period of the clock. The degree of dithering can be adjusted by programming the feedback resistance in the subtractor. The subtractor reduces the sensitivity of dithering to errors in the DAC, allowing for an inexpensive, less precise DAC.",LEUNG CHI TAK GERRY;;NG CHIK WAI DAVID;;KWAN HING KIT;;SO WAI KIT VICTOR;;CHANG PO WAH;;MAK WING CHEONG;;KWONG KWOK KUEN;;HK APPLIED SCIENCE & TECH RES,LEUNG CHI TAK GERRY;;NG CHIK WAI DAVID;;KWAN HING KIT;;SO WAI KIT VICTOR;;CHANG PO WAH;;MAK WING CHEONG;;KWONG KWOK KUEN,HONG KONG APPLIED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH INSTITUTE CO LTD (2010-12-23),https://lens.org/183-025-953-813-092,Patent Application,yes,2,14,2,2,0,H03L7/08;;H03L7/08,H03L7/00,331/17,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The clock sequences a counter that drives a digital count value to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The DAC outputs a sawtooth wave with a wide voltage swing. A subtractor scales down the voltage swing to produce a reduced-swing sawtooth wave which is used as an upper limit voltage. Comparators trigger a set-reset latch to toggle the clock when current pumps charge and discharge a capacitor beyond voltage limits. Since the upper limit voltage is the reduced sawtooth wave from the subtractor, the amount of time to charge the capacitor varies, dithering the period of the clock. The degree of dithering can be adjusted by programming the feedback resistance in the subtractor. The subtractor reduces the sensitivity of dithering to errors in the DAC, allowing for an inexpensive, less precise DAC.",LEUNG CHI TAK GERRY;;NG CHIK WAI DAVID;;KWAN HING KIT;;SO WAI KIT VICTOR;;CHANG PO WAH PATRICK;;MAK WING CHEONG;;KWONG KWOK KUEN DAVID;;HK APPLIED SCIENCE & TECH RES,LEUNG CHI TAK GERRY;;NG CHIK WAI DAVID;;KWAN HING KIT;;SO WAI KIT VICTOR;;CHANG PO WAH PATRICK;;MAK WING CHEONG;;KWONG KWOK KUEN DAVID,HONG KONG APPLIED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH INSTITUTE CO LTD (2010-12-23),https://lens.org/057-413-458-578-976,Granted Patent,yes,7,7,2,2,0,H03L7/08;;H03L7/08,H03B29/00;;H03K3/26,331/78;;331/111,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

A GBM tumor of a human subject is analyzed to identify the presence or absence of a somatic mutation at codon 132 in IDH1 or at codon 172 in isocitrate dehydrogenase IDH2, thereby identifying the tumor as the one that is more likely to be a secondary GBM when the somatic mutation exists or as the one that is more likely to be a primary GBM when the somatic mutation does not exist.",UNIV JOHNS HOPKINS;;UNIV DUKE,BERT VOGELSTEIN;;KINZLER KENNETH W;;D WILLIAMS PARSONS;;ZHANG XIAOSONG;;LIN JIMMY CHANG-HO;;REBECCA J LEARY;;PHILIPP ANGENENDT;;NICKOLAS PAPADOPOULOS;;VICTOR VELCULESCU;;GIOVANNI PARMIGIANI;;RACHEL KARCHIN;;SIAN JONES;;YAN HAI;;DARELL BIGNER;;KUAN CHIEN-TSUN;;RIGGINS GREGORY J,,https://lens.org/105-525-419-424-101,Patent Application,no,4,0,42,42,136,C12Q2600/112;;C12Q2600/118;;C12Q2600/136;;C12Q2600/156;;C12Q1/6886;;A61P35/00;;A61P37/04;;C12Q2600/112;;C12Q2600/118;;C12Q2600/136;;C12Q2600/156;;G16B20/20;;G16B40/20;;C12Q1/6886,C12Q1/68;;C12N15/09;;C12Q1/32;;G01N33/573,,3,1,040-988-224-915-933,pmc2820383;;19228619;;10.1056/nejmoa0808710,"TOBIAS SJOEBLOM: ""THE CONSENSUS CODING SEQUENCES OF HUMAN BREAST AND COLORECTAL CANCERS"", SCIENCE, vol.

First, we determined the sequences of 23,781 transcripts, representing 20,583 protein-encoding genes, in DNA from these tumors. Second, we searched for homozygous deletions and amplifications using microarrays querying one million single nucleotide polymorphisms in each sample. Third, we analyzed the transcriptomes of the same samples using SAGE and next-generation sequencing-by-synthesis technologies We found that pancreatic cancers contain an average of 63 genetic alterations, of which 49 are point mutations, 8 are homozygous deletions, and 6 are amplifications. Further analyses revealed a core set of 12 regulatory processes or pathways that were each genetically altered in 70 % to 100 % of the samples. The data suggest that dysregulation of this core set of pathways is responsible for the major features of pancreatic tumorigenesis.",UNIV JOHNS HOPKINS;;VOGELSTEIN BERT;;KINZLER KENNETH W;;PARSONS D WILLIAMS;;JONES SIAN;;ZHANG XIAOSONG;;LIN JIMMY CHANG-HO;;LEARY REBECCA J;;ANGENENDT PHILIPP;;PAPADOPOULOS NICKOLAS;;VELCULESCU VICTOR;;PARMIGIANI GIOVANNI;;KARCHIN RACHEL;;KERN SCOTT;;HRUBAN RALPH;;ESHLEMAN JAMES R;;GOGGINS MICHAEL;;KLEIN ALISON,VOGELSTEIN BERT;;KINZLER KENNETH W;;PARSONS D WILLIAMS;;JONES SIAN;;ZHANG XIAOSONG;;LIN JIMMY CHANG-HO;;LEARY REBECCA J;;ANGENENDT PHILIPP;;PAPADOPOULOS NICKOLAS;;VELCULESCU VICTOR;;PARMIGIANI GIOVANNI;;KARCHIN RACHEL;;KERN SCOTT;;HRUBAN RALPH;;ESHLEMAN JAMES R;;GOGGINS MICHAEL;;KLEIN ALISON,,https://lens.org/150-867-805-332-290,Patent Application,yes,0,0,14,23,1,C12Q1/6886;;C12Q2600/156;;G01N33/57438;;G01N2800/50;;G01N33/57438;;C12Q2600/156;;G01N2800/50;;C12Q1/6886,C12Q1/68,,0,0,,,,PENDING
