According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a vacuum cleaning system for the wet cleaning of surfaces such as carpets, which system comprises: a vacuum cleaning unit (10) comprising liquid distribution means (34) for introducing a cleaning liquid onto surface to be cleaned and extraction means (32) for removing cleaning liquid from the surface by entrainment of liquid into an airflow induced by a vacuum source (12), a first reservoir (53) for providing a source of cleaning liquid for use in wet cleaning, liquid transport means (36) for feeding cleaning liquid from the first reservoir (53) to the liquid distribution means (34) for the vacuum cleaning unit (10), and a second reservoir (11) into which airflow-entrained used cleaning liquid may be deposited from subsequent disposal, characterized in that the first and second reservoirs (53, 11) are spaced apart from one another and disposed in separate transportable units (51, 10), which units permit each reservoir to be manipulated and translated independently of the other, thereby facilitating emptying of the second reservoir (11) and filling of the first reservoir (53), and at least limited independent translational movement of the reservoirs over the surface to be cleaned.",NUMATIC INT LTD;;DUNCAN CHRISTOPHER ROBERT;;BOXELL ALAN JAMES,DUNCAN CHRISTOPHER ROBERT;;BOXELL ALAN JAMES,,https://lens.org/187-502-901-213-305,Patent Application,yes,7,4,2,2,0,A47L11/4044;;A47L9/009;;A47L11/34;;A47L11/4061,A47L11/34;;A47L9/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING
