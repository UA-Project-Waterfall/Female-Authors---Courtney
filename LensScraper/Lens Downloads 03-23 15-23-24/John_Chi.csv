For example, traversal speed is improved by grouping processing of primitives sharing at least one feature (e.g., a vertex or an edge) during ray-primitive intersection testing. Grouping the primitives for ray intersection testing can reduce processing (e.g., projections and transformations of primitive vertices and/or determining edge function values) because at least a portion of the processing results related to the shared feature in one primitive can be used in determine whether the ray intersects another primitive(s). Processing triangles sharing an edge can double the culling rate of the triangles in the ray/triangle intersection test without replicating the hardware.",NVIDIA CORP,MUTHLER GREGORY;;BURGESS JOHN;;KWONG IAN CHI YAN,NVIDIA CORPORATION (2020-06-23),https://lens.org/174-680-724-016-342,Patent Application,yes,0,6,6,6,0,G06T15/005;;G06T15/04;;G06T15/06;;G06T1/20;;G06T2200/04;;G06T15/06;;G06T15/06;;G06T15/08;;G06F9/5027;;G06T17/205;;G06T17/10,G06T15/06;;G06F9/50;;G06T15/08;;G06T17/10;;G06T17/20,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

This finding provides a new strategy for the development of HIV protease inhibitors effective against the wild type and drug-resistant mutants and further supports that FIV protease is a useful model for drug-resistant HIV proteases, which often are developed through reduction in size of the binding region for the P3 group or the combined P3 and P1 groups.",SCRIPPS RESEARCH INST;;LEE TAEKYU;;WONG CHI HUEY;;ELDER JOHN H,LEE TAEKYU;;WONG CHI-HUEY;;ELDER JOHN H,,https://lens.org/190-334-549-354-210,Patent Application,yes,9,13,4,5,0,A61K38/00;;C07D213/40;;C07D207/16;;C07D217/26;;C07D277/28;;C07D401/12;;C07K5/06026;;C07K5/06043;;C07K5/06052;;C07K5/0606;;C07K5/06069;;C07K5/06078,A61K38/00;;C07D207/16;;C07D213/40;;C07D217/26;;C07D277/24;;C07D277/28;;C07D401/12;;C07K5/06;;C07K5/062;;C07K5/065,,2,1,076-199-147-835-888,10.1021/bi00054a027;;8422397,"DREYER G B, ET AL.: ""A SYMMETRIC INHIBITOR BINDS HIV-1 PROTEASE ASYMMETRICALLY"", BIOCHEMISTRY, AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY, US, vol. 32, no. 03, 1 January 1993 (1993-01-01), US, pages 937 - 947, XP002916853, ISSN: 0006-2960, DOI: 10.1021/bi00054a027;;See also references of EP 1039886A4",PENDING

    With the help of X-ray structural analyses of drug-resistant HIV proteases and molecular modeling, a new type of inhibitor with a small P3 residue has been developed. These inhibitors are effective against HIV and its drug-resistant mutants, as well as FIV. Modification of existing HIV protease inhibitors effective against the wild type and drug-resistant mutants and further supports that FIV protease is a useful model for drug-resistant HIV proteases, which often are developed through reduction in size of the binging region for the P3 group or the combined P3 and P1 groups.

Grouping the primitives for ray intersection testing can reduce processing (e.g., projections and transformations of primitive vertices and/or determining edge function values) because at least a portion of the processing results related to the shared feature in one primitive can be used in determine whether the ray intersects another primitive(s).

An encapsulating sheet (13) is located in the air-tight chamber, such that it faces the flat member. The air pressure on the flat member is then made to be significantly lower than the air pressure on the encapsulating sheet, thereby to cause the encapsulating sheet (13) to press against the flat member (17). The encapsulating sheet is made of a flexible flame-resistant material that maintains its structural integrity and does not melt or ignite at temperatures of at least two hundred degrees Centigrade. For example, the encapsulating sheet may be of Kapton (a trademark), doped Mylar (a trademark) or aluminum foil.

   The present invention provides an elegant solution for processing multi-feature queries, which considers the differing access costs associated with each feature. Access cost is a critical factor in determining how individual features should be processed in terms of retrieving through sorted or random access, and, hence, in minimizing the overall query response time. The present invention operates dynamically during query processing and seeks to minimize the total query cost in terms of number of features retrieved and cost for access. It works by evaluating different combinations of feature access plans (sorted and random access) according to the number of retrieved features and forward access costs, and it selects the lowest cost plan. Experimental results on practical data show a significant speed-up in multi-features queries using the proposed solution.

The present invention operates dynamically during query processing and seeks to minimize the total query cost in terms of number of features retrieved and cost for access. It works by evaluating different combinations of feature access plans (sorted and random access) according to the number of retrieved features and forward access costs, and it selects the lowest cost plan.

The thin oxide layer minimizes bird beak formation, and eases the removal of the oxide/nitride/oxide/nitride layers. The resultant structure is both planar and bird's beak-free, and is therefore well suited to producing VLSI components having dimensions less than 0.5 microns.",HEWLETT PACKARD CO,HUI CHI-HUNG;;VOORDE PAUL V;;MOLL JOHN L,HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY PALO ALTO CA.

If the enable line 30 is activated, the multiplexer 28 writes new information data of a new data device 26 into the memory word 22. After the old contents of the memory word 22 are temporarily stored in the cache 24, the memory word 22 is cleared and the old contents are re-written into the memory word 22 through the multiplexer 28.

At a normal laser diode operating temperature, a range of pulsed current is passed through the laser diode and the lasing threshold current and slope efficiency of the laser diode are monitored. The laser diode is then subjected to a burn-in process in which it is driven at a high junction temperature for an extended time period. Subsequently the lasing threshold current and slope efficiency are again monitored by applying the same range of pulsed current at the normal operating temperature. If either the threshold current or the slope efficiency have changed by more than a predetermined amount, the laser diode is rejected.

   A computer-aided learning method and apparatus for a learning user to learn materials inexpensively. Not only does the apparatus provide the user the freedom as to where and when to learn, and the guidance as to what to learn, the apparatus also reduces a significant hurdle to learningTuition. The apparatus retrieves a user identifier entered by the user, and determines whether the user is a learning user or an institute user. If the user is a learning user, the apparatus allows the user to access information regarding learning materials. If the user is an institute user, the apparatus permits the user to access information regarding at least one learning user. The institute user might be interested to use the apparatus to recruit employees to fill job openings. A learning user pays significantly less than an institute user to access information, so as to encourage the learning user to work on learning materials. The apparatus can also track and update information regarding the users.

In an embodiment, a DBMS receives a request to execute an operation on its managed database. The request may include an object identifier and a version identifier for a version of a database object, which is required for the successful execution of the operation on the database. The required version of the database object may not exist and may be generated only after the execution of another, second, operation on the database. The first database server process initiates execution of the earlier received operation on the database. The first database server process queries the first database for the version of the particular database object and determines that the version of the database object does not exist yet, in one embodiment. Based on such a determination, a dependency lock is generated for the version of the object, and the first database server process is suspended, preventing the completion of execution of the earlier received operation on the database. Another, second database server process executes another operation on the database and causes the generation of the version of the object on the database. The dependency lock is thereby released for the version of the object, and the first database server process completes the execution of the first operation on the first database.",ORACLE INT CORP,HOANG CHI KIM;;WANG CHIH-PING;;BANDI NAGENDER;;MILLER JOHN,ORACLE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION (2019-06-03),https://lens.org/199-459-736-868-205,Patent Application,yes,0,3,2,2,0,G06F16/219;;G06F16/2343;;G06F16/219;;G06F16/2358;;G06F16/27;;G06F16/27,G06F16/23;;G06F16/21;;G06F16/27,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

In an embodiment, a DBMS receives a request to execute an operation on its managed database. The request may include an object identifier and a version identifier for a version of a database object, which is required for the successful execution of the operation on the database. The required version of the database object may not exist and may be generated only after the execution of another, second, operation on the database. The first database server process initiates execution of the earlier received operation on the database. The first database server process queries the first database for the version of the particular database object and determines that the version of the database object does not exist yet, in one embodiment.

The apparatus retrieves a user identifier entered by the user, and determines whether the user is a learning user or an institute user. If the user is a learning user, the apparatus allows the user to access information regarding learning materials. If the user is an institute user, the apparatus permits the user to access information regarding at least one learning user. The institute user might be interested to use the apparatus to recruit employees to fill job openings. A learning user pays significantly less than an institute user to access information, so as to encourage the learning user to work on learning materials. The apparatus can also track and update information regarding the users.
