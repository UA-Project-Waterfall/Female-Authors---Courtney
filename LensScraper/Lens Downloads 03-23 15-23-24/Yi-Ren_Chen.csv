In the first step of the process, the expanded-form mold cavity is installed in a mold such that plastic material can be shaped to an expanded type of original material component through the mold cavity. In the second step, a punching-hole process is performed onto the expanded type of original material component to form the produced material component. In the third step, the whole produced material component is placed into a continuous mold such that the continuous mold can heat the produced material component, which is gradually bent to form the U-shaped cable positioning stand. Therefore, the present invention can use the expanded original material component formed by the first step to make the original material component capable of being placed directly on the bottom of the die to conduct the punching-hole process. And, the grooves for clamping wires can be punched and manufactured on both left and right side plates simultaneously. In addition, a lockhole is shaped and formed on the bottom plate.

The optic sub-module contains an outer housing that is a one-piece or two-piece structure and whose front side and back side have passing-through insertion holes installed for respectively assembling the function components and fibers. A lens is installed among the fibers and function components. The feature of this invention is: an image inspector is used to let the focus of the sampling lens be adjusted to co-plane with the fiber coupling plane while assembling the function components. Directly use the image that comes from the illuminating or receiving planes and shows on the coupling plane as the inspection objectives, and conduct the alignment positioning and fixing of the function components in the outer housing. Because the image calibration inspection of the illuminating or receiving planes is on the fiber coupling plane directly, the traditional technology shortcoming that comes from calibrating the position of the function components through the fiber coupling ratio after installing the fibers is prevented, and the transmission bandwidth of the fiber, especially multi-mode fiber is optimized. The function component could be the surface-emitting laser diode and includes caped TO-can packaged laser diode or SMT type (bare chip) laser diode. The fiber includes single-mode, multi-mode or plastic fibers. The yielding rate of finished products is raised and inspection operation is simplified to be good for mass-production.",E PIN OPTICAL INDUSTRY CO LTD,DENG JAU-JAN;;JU YI-LIN;;CHEN GUO-REN,,https://lens.org/087-259-190-913-491,Granted Patent,no,0,1,2,2,0,,G02B6/255;;G02B6/42,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Moreover, a cross-linking process is made to cross-link the resin inside the composite material layer. Electrode trenches are etched, and an insulating layer is formed by using green paint in the electrode trenches to isolate different electrodes on the same surface of the device. The highly conductive composite material has more than twenty times the conductivity of the conductive composite material so as to ensure that among connected electrodes inside the plaque-shaped composite material, current mainly flows through the highly conductive composite material rather than the conductive composite material of positive temperature coefficient thermal sensitive resistance.
