   An optical scanning system and method for laser engraving a plurality of data subrasters into a substrate to form a raster of engraved data defining an image on the substrate. Each subraster has a length dimension and a width dimension. The system includes a transport assembly having an objective lens and a mirror, the mirror capable of reflecting a substantially collimated scanning beam incident thereon in a direction transverse to an axis of the incident beam such that it is directed to the objective lens. The objective lens is capable of focusing the scanning beam on the substrate to engrave a set of data in the width dimension of the subraster and the objective lens and mirror combination is capable of moving along the axis of the incident beam to allow subsequent engraving of other sets of data in the width dimension until a complete subraster is formed along its length dimension. The objective lens and mirror combination is also capable of returning to its starting position to begin engraving of a subsequent subraster of the plurality of subrasters forming the raster of engraved data. A thermoset plastic substrate is also identified as being particularly suitable for use with the aforementioned system and method.

The audit agent forwards normalized audits to the SI&W Engine. The SI&W Engine groups the normalized audits into related groupings. Gauges are used to count the number of occurrences of audited events. A statistical engine provides statistical representations of the number of events per user, per session and per node. A predetermined number of criteria are defined a particular gauge or gauge pair. There may be many criteria for a particular network. When a predetermined number of criteria within a criteria set are triggered, an indicator is triggered. More complex indicators can use combinations of lower level indicators to provide further indications of potential security threads. Thus, a hierarchical system of gauges, criteria and indicators is used to measure boundary violations and breaches of different barriers.

The opening in each reflector permits most of the sonic energy to pass to a subsequent reflective surface, while the periphery about the opening provides echo signals for determining physical conditions in the environment through which the sonic energy has passed. A system is used for determining physical conditions that are a function of time differences between signals from different reflectors, calculated with a highly efficient digital signal processing algorithm. The present invention is usable, for example, in the measurement of physical conditions inside an underground liquid storage tank. <IMAGE>",CAMPBELL SCIENT INC,CAMPBELL ERIC C;;CAMPBELL GAYLON C;;NORTON JEFFREY A;;HEERS ARTHUR F,,https://lens.org/018-056-633-415-326,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,G01D7/02;;G01F/;;G05D9/00;;G05D23/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Bit map images representing a page of data are divided into bands and compressed into the printer memory. Then, when needed by the interpreter/rasterizer, they are decompressed into another portion of that memory, or when desired to print those bands they are directly transmitted to a decompression engine. The bands of bit map image are compressed using a Lempel-Ziv algorithm that contains improvements allowing compression towards the end of the band and improves the compression speed at the beginning of the band by initializing a hash table. Further, the interpreter/rasterizer switches between compression routines depending on the available memory and the desired speed of compression. The compression routine requests supplemental destination buffers when it needs additional memory in which to compress data. Finally, the compression continues to add margin white space during the compression of the uncompressed bit images so that margin what space need not be stored in the uncompressed bit image.",COMPAQ COMPUTER CORP,CAMPBELL SCOTT O;;ADAMS GREG;;BRAATEN JEFFREY M,COMPAQ COMPUTER CORPORATION (1992-10-12);;HEWLETT-PACKARD DEVELOPMENT COMPANY L.P (2001-06-20),https://lens.org/057-148-111-305-456,Granted Patent,yes,7,89,2,2,0,G06T9/005;;H03M7/3086;;H03M7/3086;;G06T9/005,G06T9/00;;H03M7/30,395/114;;395/115,3,2,083-252-431-167-251;;012-283-374-860-493,10.1109/mc.1984.1659158;;10.1109/dcc.1991.213344,"Welch, T.A., A Technique for High Performance Data Compression. iEEE Computer , (Jun. 1984), pp. 8 19.;;Williams, R.N., An Extremely Fast ZIV Lempel Data Compression Algorithm.

The resonance frequency of the crystal is then again measured, and the difference between the resonance frequency before and after the incubation period will indicate the extent of hybridization.",UNIV SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI,FAWCETT NEWTON C;;EVANS JEFFREY A;;CAMPBELL NAOMI FLOWERS,SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI UNIVERSITY OF THE (1995-05-31),https://lens.org/153-758-261-911-281,Granted Patent,yes,3,13,2,9,0,C12Q1/6825;;G01N29/036;;G01N33/542;;G01N33/54373;;G01N2291/0256;;G01N2291/0257;;G01N29/036;;G01N2291/0256;;G01N33/542;;G01N2291/0257;;G01N33/54373;;C12Q1/6825,C12Q1/68;;G01N27/00;;G01N33/542;;G01N33/543,435/6;;435/287.2;;536/24.3;;422/68.1,4,2,131-898-591-716-40X;;031-767-872-275-289,10.1093/nar/17.16.6749;;2506529;;pmc318387;;345354,"Kathryn Ann Drozda, The use of Hybridization, Piezoelectric Crystals and Recombinant DNA Technology in the Detection of Salmonella typhimurium , masters thesis, University of Southern Mississippi Aug. 1985.;;Sommer and Tautz, Nucleic Acids Research , vol. 17, No. 16, 1989, p. 6749.;;Characterization and Clinical Identification of Enterobacteriaceae by DNA Hybridization by Don J.

The strip of each stack is spliced to the strip of the next stack to form a continuous strip through the package which can be unfolded for supply continuously to an end use machine. The package while compressed is wrapped by a packaging material which includes a bottom header plate and heat shrink bag wrapped around the package and under a bottom header plate and heat sealed to a bottom surface of the bottom header plate. The spliced connecting portions are held attached to the end plane of the package by a series of spaced tie members formed of spare strip material each of which extends across the end plane and has opposed ends of the tie member tucked between two of the strip portions of respective ones of the outermost stacks. Downstream of the supply and prior to folding a splice detector is responsive to the presence of a supply splice in the web and the control of the process is arranged to mark for rejection any package wherein the number of detected supply splices contained therein is greater than a predetermined number. The strip portions are spliced by ultrasonically heating the strip portions while in contact preferably at a butt splice while using heat sealable bridging fibers to effect a heat seal between the portions.,BKI HOLDING CORP,LAM STEVE SZE WAN;;CAMPBELL ALAN JEFFREY;;FLAMAN RANDALL,BUCKEYE TECHNOLOGIES INC (2007-06-30);;BKI HOLDING CORPORATION (2005-04-07),https://lens.org/094-250-598-466-237,Granted Patent,yes,37,1,18,20,0,B29C65/08;;B29C66/1122;;B29C66/43;;B65B9/135;;B65B53/02;;B65B63/04;;B65D71/10;;B65H21/00;;D06H5/00;;B29C66/49;;B29C66/4312;;B29C66/4322;;B29C66/73715;;B29C66/1142;;D06H5/00;;B29C66/1122;;B65B53/02;;B29C66/43;;B29C65/08;;B65H21/00;;B65B9/135;;B65B63/04;;B65D71/10;;B29C66/4312;;B29C66/4322;;B29C66/49;;B29C66/73715;;B29C66/1142,B65B63/04;;B65B9/13;;B65B53/02;;B65D71/00;;B65D71/10;;B65D85/07;;B65H21/00;;D06H5/00,53/429;;53/434;;53/435,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Further, dependency levels allow a control thread to perform control-thread-only operations while maintaining multi-thread processing capabilities.",MICROSOFT CORP,DUZAK JEFFREY J;;BECKER ANDREW;;ANDROSKI MATTHEW J;;CAMPBELL DUANE,MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (2006-05-18),https://lens.org/193-443-288-757-215,Granted Patent,yes,45,7,24,24,0,G06F9/5066;;G06F40/18;;G06F17/00;;G06F9/5066;;G06F40/18,G06F17/12,715/212;;712/28,93,29,041-064-596-880-109;;051-440-251-393-451;;024-432-102-495-404;;030-901-280-420-946;;027-441-993-833-430;;106-088-160-294-195;;015-081-547-487-265;;055-491-785-863-142;;082-574-453-795-086;;049-135-216-867-479;;064-008-863-978-230;;173-953-290-339-885;;069-956-773-058-58X;;094-042-650-548-680;;078-894-331-767-413;;061-771-058-915-499;;131-810-890-110-644;;003-785-579-906-348;;008-653-032-937-308;;089-631-095-877-497;;049-890-798-548-337;;045-924-742-358-646;;045-320-155-958-332;;128-484-015-226-471;;006-684-290-130-274;;072-829-871-039-100;;032-973-134-045-055;;001-517-002-395-383;;012-993-124-899-324,10.1021/ci9501960;;10.1016/s0969-8043(96)00083-8;;10927154;;10.1016/s0169-2607(00)00076-6;;10092032;;10.1016/s0169-2607(98)00077-7;;10.1080/00220480309595217;;10.1145/251634.251640;;10.21236/ada268765;;11388734;;10.1097/00004032-200106000-00015;;10.1117/12.294343;;10360217;;10.1016/0015-1882(94)80541-5;;10.1016/0960-1481(96)88516-8;;10.1016/s0920-3796(96)00485-1;;10.1109/vl.1996.545267;;10.1145/192161.192190;;14512292;;10.1152/ajpcell.00270.2003;;10.1109/wcre.2002.1173080;;10.1109/ias.1990.152371;;10.1049/ic:19980586;;10.1006/ijhc.1994.1086;;10.1007/978-3-642-58113-7_70;;10.1016/0961-9534(95)00027-5;;10.1108/09576069510093433;;10.1016/0098-3004(92)90059-z;;10.1177/003754979506400603;;10.1117/12.416819;;10.1109/soac.1990.82138;;15239590;;10.1016/s0965-9978(96)00044-0,"Minami, Parallel Spreadsheet Processing, Feb. 15, 1994, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Hokuriku, pp. 1-4.;;Nadiminti et al., ExcelGrid: A .NET Plug-in for Outsourcing Excel Spreadsheet Workload to Enterprise and Global Grids, , Dec. 15-18, 2004, ADCOM 2004 Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication, pp. 1-13.

The vent is configured to be installed along a hip of the roof overlying and covering a ventilation slot formed through the roof deck along the hip. The vent includes an elongated laterally flexible top panel from which baffle arrays depend. The baffle arrays are formed of a plurality of depending arcuately curved vanes that arc away from the vent. The vanes are aerodynamically shaped to redirect wind-blown rain and snow away from the vent and are configured to block the migration of rain and snow through the vent. A pair of spongy conformable filler strips is attached beneath the edge portions of the vent. The filler strips conform to the shapes of underlying shingles when the vent is installed to fill any gaps that otherwise might be formed between the vent and the shingles.

The vent is configured to be installed along a hip of the roof overlying and covering a ventilation slot formed through the roof deck along the hip. The vent includes an elongated laterally flexible top panel from which baffle arrays depend. The baffle arrays are formed of a plurality of depending arcuately curved vanes that arc away from the vent. The vanes are aerodynamically shaped to redirect wind-blown rain and snow away from the vent and are configured to block the migration of rain and snow through the vent. A pair of spongy conformable filler strips is attached beneath the edge portions of the vent. The filler strips conform to the shapes of underlying shingles when the vent is installed to fill any gaps that otherwise might be formed between the vent and the shingles. A weather filter drapes over some of the baffle arrays to allow attic air to pass but prevent ingress of blown snowflakes and raindrops.,BUILDING MAT INVESTMENT CORP;;BMIC LLC,MANASTERSKI TIM;;ZARATE WALTER;;RAILKAR SUDHIR;;AVITABILE JEFFREY;;CAMPBELL PETER,BMIC LLC (2015-01-22),https://lens.org/083-355-532-750-894,Granted Patent,yes,22,1,9,9,0,E04D13/174;;E04D13/174;;E04D13/176;;E04D13/17;;F24F13/08,E04D13/17;;F24F13/08,,3,0,,,"MID America; “Hip Master”; The Tapco Group. 2015.;;Air Vent, Inc.; “Hip Ridge Vent.”; http:www/airvent.com/professional/products/ridgeVents-hipridge.shtml.

This equalization cancels any mismatch in either capacitor (53, 54/72, 73) which would tend to affect an associated common-mode voltage. During a second time period, the two capacitors (53, 54/72, 73) are connected in series between two signal lines (42, 43). In one embodiment, the switched-capacitor circuit (50) forms a common-mode feedback sensing circuit by providing a common-mode feedback voltage to a fully-differential amplifier (41) at a common interconnection point of the two capacitors (53, 54). This embodiment draws no DC current, and thus prevents harmonic distortion of an output signal on the two signal lines when using a slew-rate limited amplifier (41). In another embodiment, the switched-capacitor circuit (61) functions as an input sampler at an input of a switched-capacitor amplifier circuit (60).",MOTOROLA INC,GANGER JEFFREY D;;MCCOLLOUGH KELVIN E;;CAMPBELL JR JULES D,MOTOROLA INC (1993-10-04),https://lens.org/178-038-296-798-786,Granted Patent,yes,5,41,1,1,0,H03F3/005;;H03F3/005;;H03F3/45479;;H03F3/45479;;H03H19/004;;H03H19/004,H03F3/45;;H03H19/00,330/258;;330/9;;330/302;;307/352;;307/353;;320/1;;363/62,2,2,025-100-195-160-966;;102-094-791-162-522,10.1109/jssc.1982.1051855;;10.1002/j.1538-7305.1979.tb02243.x,"Senderowicz, et al., A Family of Differential NMOS Analog Cir. for a PCM Codec Filter Chip , IEEE Jour. of Solid State Circuit; vol.

The vent includes an elongated laterally flexible top panel from which baffle arrays depend. The baffle arrays are formed of a plurality of depending arcuately curved vanes that arc away from the vent. The vanes are aerodynamically shaped to redirect wind-blown rain and snow away from the vent and are configured to block the migration of rain and snow through the vent. A pair of spongy conformable filler strips is attached beneath the edge portions of the vent. The filler strips conform to the shapes of underlying shingles when the vent is installed to fill any gaps that otherwise might be formed between the vent and the shingles.

Left-censored data may then be derived from previous treatment history data for each subject, the left-censored data including a clearance period and an event or censored. A time scale of the left punctured therapy data is then inverted to produce right punctured therapy data.

For consecutive variables within the one or more variables of interest, a maximum selection logarithmic rank statistic over a plurality of cutoff values within a predefined percentile range is calculated. One or more variables having a maximum selection logarithmic rank statistic below a first predefined threshold and associated cutoff values are then identified for the continuous variables.

Uma cadeia de cálculo simples pode ser reordenada em uma cadeia unificada onde fórmulas de suporte e dependentes são organizadas em uma hierarquia de árvore de cadeias-filhas. A cadeia unificada é também dividida em níveis de dependência onde as entradas em cada nível de dependência podem ser movidas para um próximo nível de dependência durante a reordenação. Se uma entrada dentro de um nível de dependência for dependente de outra entrada não encontrada dentro de sua própria cadeia-filha, a cadeia unificada é ordenada de modo que uma entrada seja apenas dependente de uma entrada em um nível de dependência anterior. Também, níveis de dependência permitem uma cadeia de controle executar operações apenas de cadeia de controle enquanto mantendo as capacidades de processamento de multicadeias.",MICROSOFT CORP,DUZAK JEFFREY J;;BECKER ANDREW;;ANDROSKI MATTHEW J;;CAMPBELL DUANE,,https://lens.org/131-497-754-882-561,Patent Application,no,0,0,24,24,0,G06F9/5066;;G06F40/18;;G06F17/00;;G06F9/5066;;G06F40/18,G06F17/00;;G06F17/21,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The present improvement includes load balancing, wherein degraded service of audio response units (ARUs) is detected. With load balancing, individual EVS ARU nodes are lumped into groups, where a group is a set of two or more functionally identical EVS audio response units (ARUs) that all support the same EVS customer applications. An inbound call for a given EVS application can be routed, based on a lookup at the data access point (DAP), to any ARU in the group. With the operating level of each ARU in a particular group being known, the percent allocations for each ARU are determined and an update is made at the DAP to route incoming calls to each ARU in the group according to the specified percentages. The load balancing process operates with a set of predefined rules for determining ARU statuses and call allocations, and also has the ability to actually throttle back calls if multiple nodes in an ARU group are degraded.",MCI WORLDCOM INC,CAMPBELL JEFFREY W;;MOLDENHAUER JUDY A;;HOLMES ALLEN;;CRABLE PHILLIP D,VERIZON PATENT AND LICENSING INC (2014-04-09);;TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT (1996-08-15),https://lens.org/174-522-832-617-731,Granted Patent,yes,13,13,1,1,0,H04M3/4872;;H04M3/5158;;H04M3/5158;;H04M3/4872,H04M3/487;;H04M3/51,379/88.18;;379/265;;379/309,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

An electrode wire can supply energy to the weld pool while being fed at a first feed rate into the weld pool. A second wire can be fed into the weld pool at a second feed rate to deposit additional material and thereby speed up the overall material deposition rate. All of the energy in the weld pool may be supplied by the electrode wire. The printer can dynamically control the first feed rate and the second feed rate during printing. A mathematical model can be used to determine the second feed rate as a function of the first feed rate, the energy put into the weld pool, and the print head travel speed. The second feed rate may optimize the material deposition rate according to the model.

The leading edge of each pulse is sharpened either by a metal foil 18 or by phase conjugation reflection means 18a, 18e including a stimulated Brillouin scattering cell 18d,18e and optionally a Faraday isolator 18b. Each pulse is directed onto an amplifier 123 comprising first and second laser amplifier rods 23a,23b in series. At least a major portion of the radiation 112 amplified by the first amplifier rod 23a is directed to the second amplifier rod 23b, where it is amplified and then directed to a surface of the solid material. Substantially uniform spatial amplitude is achieved in the radiation 112 in at least one of these ways: A pair of flashlamps 70,71 are included with each laser amplifier rod 23a,23b for pumping the rod; the axis of each flashlamp 70,71 and the axis of the first rod 23a are substantially parallel to each other and substantially in the same (first) plane; and a (second) plane containing the axis of the second rod 23b and the parallel axes of its associated flashlamps 70,71 is substantially perpendicular to the first plane; and/or the oscillator 10c provides a beam of unpolarized coherent radiation 12T in which the spatial amplitude pattern of each succeeding pulse is substantially a mirror image of the pattern in the pulse that preceded it, or is rotated about its axis by a predetermined smaller angle from the pattern in the pulse that preceded it.",BATTELLE MEMORIAL INSTITUTE,EPSTEIN HAROLD;;CLAUER ALLAN;;MUELLER BOYD;;DULANEY JEFFREY;;CAMPBELL BERNERD;;WALTERS CRAIG,,https://lens.org/185-538-127-151-636,Granted Patent,no,0,1,14,14,0,C21D10/005;;Y10S148/903;;B23K26/356;;C21D10/005;;Y10S148/903;;B23K26/356,B01J3/08;;B23K26/06;;B23K26/073;;C21D10/00;;C22F3/00;;H01S3/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
