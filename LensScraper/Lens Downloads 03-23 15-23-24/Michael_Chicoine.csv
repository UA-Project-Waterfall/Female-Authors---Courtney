Some embodiments may provide for an apparatus configured to establish consumer device presence-based transaction sessions. The apparatus and consumer device may wirelessly communicate for a variety interactions within the transaction session. For example, consumers may be allowed to provide one or more instances of consumer approval data for payment. The transaction session may be closed upon receipt of consumer approval data or may be kept open based on wirelessly polling for consumer device presence. Based on the lack of consumer device presence, the apparatus may be configured to close the transaction session and subsequently facilitate a transaction. In various embodiments, the apparatus may be a merchant device or a server. For example, the apparatus may be a server of a central system configured to facilitate transaction sessions between merchant devices and consumer devices.",GROUPON INC,CHEN MICHAEL;;SKILLINGTON ROBERT JAMES;;ROBINSON JAY WALTER;;ARTMAN TUOMAS SANTERI;;MATIAS SEPULVEDA CRISTIAN;;ZLOOF JOSHUA ISAAC;;CHICOINE LESLIE JEAN;;DIN MAHMUDUL AREFIN,GROUPON INC (2012-02-24),https://lens.org/068-376-844-300-234,Patent Application,yes,0,0,4,4,0,G06Q20/202;;G06Q20/3224;;G06Q20/325;;G06Q20/42;;G06Q20/40155;;G06Q20/02;;G06Q20/405;;G06Q20/36;;G06Q20/3825;;G06Q20/3823;;G06Q20/385;;G06Q20/327;;G06Q20/202;;G06Q20/36;;G06Q20/40,G06Q20/32;;G06Q20/20;;G06Q20/36;;G06Q20/40,,0,0,,,,PENDING
