Inspecting steel strip magnetically and photo-electrically. GILLETTE CO. Oct. 13, 1967 [Oct. 14, 1966], No.46736/67. Headings G1A and G1N. In the manufacture of razor blades the steel strip is inspected for defects during the tempering and sharpening processes, and a defect is marked with a magnetic spot for subsequent detection and rejection of the marked section. The defect sensors may also actuate counters and trigger indicator flash-lamps. Defects which may be sensed are:- (i) ""sweep"" (curvature in the plane of the strip) by a gimbaled roller carrying a mask to vary a light beam relative to a photo-electric cell (unit (18), Fig. 2, not shown); (ii) ""dish"" by a vacuum head connected to a differential-transformer-vacuum-sensor (unit (20), Fig. 2); (iii) ""burrs"" by direct electrical contact, (unit (22), Fig.2); (iv) ""width"" by mechanical contact actuating an air valve, (unit (24), Fig. 2); and after sharpening by the masking of a light beam Fig. 6 (not shown) (v) ""welds"" by a thickness feeler actuating a switch Figs. 7a, b (not shown), to provide a magnetic mark which is subsequently detected and the welds removed (vi) ""edge"" i.e. quality of the honed facet by light scattered from the facet. (vii) flaws in steel detected by a ""gauss meter"". Edge detector Fig. 5a (not shown) a parallel beam of light shines through a masking slit on to the blade edge and a photo-multiplier and associated optical system senses light scattered at an angle of 60 degrees to the parallel beam, (the half angle at the blade tip being 28 degrees). A second detector views the other facet about 8"" along the strip. The light beams are chopped by a slotted disc to provide an A. C. signal, and may be derived from a single bulb by prism reflectors Figs. 5b, 5c (not shown). Associated circuitry for processing the sensor signals, triggering the indicator flash-lamps power supplies &c. is described with reference to Figs. 8. . 10 (not shown).",GILLETTE CO,PICKEL JAMES BRENNAN,,https://lens.org/097-167-151-779-626,Granted Patent,no,0,1,9,10,0,B21D53/645;;G07C3/14;;Y10T29/49798;;Y10T29/49778;;Y10T29/51;;Y10T29/49798;;Y10T29/49778;;Y10T29/51;;G07C3/14;;B21D53/645,B07C5/344;;G01N27/80;;B21D53/64;;G07C3/14,B3A A92           A92;;G1A APB           PB3A;;G1A AR7           4;;G1A A20Y          4;;G1A A203          4;;G1A A208          4;;G1A A21Y          4;;G1A A247          4;;G1A A248          4;;G1A A269          4;;G1A A307          4;;G1A A357          4;;G1A A358          4;;G1A A369          4;;G1A A401          4;;G1A A403          4;;G1A A407          4;;G1A A42Y          4;;G1A A426          4;;G1A A428          4;;G1A A43Y          4;;G1A A436          4;;G1A A438          4;;G1A A447          4;;G1A A448          4;;G1A A457          4;;G1A A458          4;;G1A A46Y          4;;G1A A461          4;;G1A A463          4;;G1A A464          4;;G1A A467          4;;G1A A473          4;;G1A A477          4;;G1A A480          4;;G1A A482          4;;G1A A488          4;;G1A A49X          4;;G1A A500          4;;G1A A52Y          4;;G1A A521          4;;G1A A53Y          4;;G1A A530          4;;G1A A532          4;;G1A A58Y          4;;G1A A581          4;;G1A A582          4;;G1A A589          4;;G1A A59Y          4;;G1A A590          4;;G1A A599          4;;G1A A627          4;;G1A A70Y          4;;G1A A700          4;;G1A A702          4;;G1A A761          4;;G1A A763          4;;G1A A78Y          4;;G1A A782          4;;G1N NCDC          CDC;;G1N N19B2GX       CDC;;G1N N19F7D2       CDC;;G1N N19H1M        CDC;;G1N N19H1X        CDC,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Thus account is taken of residual heat in the matrix and power is supplied sufficient only to make up the losses. In a modification the number of elements activated to form a character is also taken into account. As shown Fig. 2, a print head comprises a 5 Î 5 matrix of thermally isolated semiconductor mesas 12 bonded to a ceramic chip 14 by an epoxy resin layer. A transistor 18 and heating resistor R20 (Fig. 4) are diffused on the interior face of each mesa. A buffer transistor 22 is diffused on the face of a semiconductor chip 24 in the area defined by dotted lines 26. The ceramic chip is bonded to a metallic heat sink (28) Fig. 3, not shown. A temperature sensing diode 52 is located on the ceramic chip, the offset voltage across the diode being significant of the average temp. The temp. is sampled when a negative going pulse is applied at input 27, which results in conduction of a transistor switch 64 and the potential at a point 62, and which is significant of the temperature, is applied to capacitor 64. The charge in C64 is applied as one input to an amplifier 76 and is dependent upon the offset voltage across the diode 52. A second input to the amplifier 76 is pre-adjusted by a potentiometer 86 so that the voltage at its slider equals the voltage at point 62 when diode 52 is at ambient room temp. and is modified by a feed back current from the print head via R84 so that the amplifier output will be proportional to the stored voltage. As the temp. of the head increases due to increase in printing speed or due to the characters printed, the voltage drop across diode 52 decreases, decreasing the input voltage to 76. Thus the output voltage of the amplifier output stage 78, 80 in a line 82 and necessary to balance the amplifier is also reduced. The amplifier output is further reduced by current through R86 the value of which determines the reduction in output voltage for a given increase in the temperature of diode 52. Since the amplifier output controls the collector current of the print head transistors 18, 22, the electric heating power supplied to the head is reduced. In a modification, Figs. 5, 6 (not shown), the temp. sensor is a thermistor mounted on the back face of the heat sink. Also the amplitude of the charging voltage of the capacitor is modified in dependence upon the number of elements energized to form a character, the more the number of elements the greater the applied charging voltage. The capacitor is charged during a print cycle and is discharged during a non-printing cycle. The charge and discharge of the capacitor simulates the rate at which the matrix is heated and cooled relative to the temperature of the heat sink and compensates for thermal delay from the matrix to the thermistor. The voltage applied to the non- inverting input of the amplifier is a measure of the thermistor temperature and the charge on the capacitor estimates the temperature difference between the matrix and thermistor prior to the print cycle. The supply voltage and hence power applied to drive the matrix is then set at a level related to the absolute temp. of the matrix during the succeeding print cycle and uniform print density will be achieved under all conditions.",TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INC,BRENNAN JAMES JR,,https://lens.org/164-477-215-884-946,Granted Patent,no,0,0,15,15,0,B41J2/36;;B41J2/36;;B41J2/365;;B41J2/365;;G09F9/30;;G09F9/30;;G09G3/16;;G09G3/16;;H04N3/14;;H04N3/14,B41J2/30;;B41J2/36;;B41J2/365;;G06K15/10;;G09F9/30;;G09G3/02;;G09G3/16;;H04N3/14,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A shipping pallet comprises a rectangular planar base member having two opposing ends and two opposing sides. Pivotally connected to one of the ends of the base member is a handle member that is adapted to be pivoted from a stored position, wherein the handle member is folded on top of the base member, to an operative position, wherein the handle member extends upwardly from the base member. The under surface of the base member includes a pair of elongated spaced apart pockets that extend the length of the base member on either side of the center line thereof. An elongated rail is associated with each of the pockets. Hydraulic rams or other power devices move the rails between a first position wherein they are within the pockets so that the planar base member of the pallet rests directly on a support surface and a second position where the rails extend downwardly to support the pallet thereon. The pallets and handle members are so configured and dimensioned so that the handle fits between the elongated rails of the pallet positioned directly above or within a recess of that pallet so as not to interfere with the ability to stack a plurality of pallets on top of each other.

A communications device communicates the guidance commands or sensed position and/or angle information to the vehicle.,BRENNAN SEAN NICHOLAS;;DORRIS JAMES THEODORE;;VOLVO TRUCK CORP,BRENNAN SEAN NICHOLAS;;DORRIS JAMES THEODORE,,https://lens.org/159-595-514-783-973,Patent Application,yes,3,12,8,8,0,G05D1/0282;;G05D1/0246;;G05D1/0225;;B62D13/06;;B62D15/027;;B62D15/0285;;G05D1/0282;;G05D1/0225;;G05D1/0246;;B62D13/06;;B60W30/06;;B62D15/027;;B62D15/0285;;B62D15/021;;B62D15/028,B62D15/02;;B62D13/06;;G05D1/02,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The novel memory cell is implemented with a merged transistor structure having an access transistor and a programmable transistor. The memory cell is constructed by having the control gate, formed of a first polysilicon layer, covering a portion of the channel length between drain and source to form the access portion of the merged transistors, and a floating gate formed of a second polysilicon layer overlapping a second portion of the channel length to form the programmable transistor portion of the merged transistor. Such merged transistor structure is equivalent to two transistors in series, a programmable transistor in series with an access transistor. A memory cell structure described in accordance with this invention allows a reduction of the portion of the floating gate covering the programmable transistor portion of the channel length. This results in a reduction in the floating gate to substrate capacitance (C FB ) thereby improving the programming coupling ratio and reducing the overall cell size.",NAT SEMICONDUCTOR CORP,"AMIN, ALAAELDIN A.M.;;BRENNAN, JAMES, JR.",,https://lens.org/193-834-943-916-365,Search Report,yes,3,0,7,7,0,G11C16/0425;;G11C16/0425;;H01L29/7886;;H01L29/7886,H01L21/8247;;G11C16/04;;H01L29/788;;H01L29/792,,4,2,008-561-308-978-031;;100-633-245-088-238,10.1109/melcon.1991.161839;;10.1049/ip-g-2.1992.0060,"ALAAELDIN A M AMIN: ""A novel flash erase EEPROM memory cell with reversed poly roles"", PROCEEDINGS 6TH MEDITERRANEAN ELECTROTECHNICAL CONFERENCE, 22 May 1991 (1991-05-22), LJUBLJANA,YU, pages 311 - 314;;A.A.M.

The novel memory cell is implemented with a merged transistor structure having an access transistor and a programmable transistor. The memory cell is constructed by having the control gate, formed of a first polysilicon layer, covering a portion of the channel length between drain and source to form the access portion of the merged transistors, and a floating gate formed of a second polysilicon layer overlapping a second portion of the channel length to form the programmable transistor portion of the merged transistor. Such merged transistor structure is equivalent to two transistors in series, a programmable transistor in series with an access transistor. A memory cell structure described in accordance with this invention allows a reduction of the portion of the floating gate covering the programmable transistor portion of the channel length. This results in a reduction in the floating gate to substrate capacitance (C.sub.FB) thereby improving the programming coupling ratio and reducing the overall cell size.",NAT SEMICONDUCTOR CORP,AMIN ALAAELDIN A M;;BRENNAN JR JAMES,NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION A CORP.

A gas-core Bragg optical fiber waveguide can be advantageously used in such systems to stretch the duration of pulses so that they can be amplified, and/or Bragg fibers can be used to compress optical signals into much shorter duration pulses after they have been amplified. Bragg fibers can also function as near-zero-dispersion delay lines in amplifier sections.",RAYDIANCE INC,BRENNAN III JAMES F;;VAISSIE LAURENT;;MIELKE MICHAEL,RAYDIANCE INC (2005-07-12);;COHERENT INC (2015-07-22);;RAYD LLC (2015-07-23),https://lens.org/157-189-434-416-237,Granted Patent,yes,0,3,13,13,0,G02B6/02266;;G02B6/02304;;G02B6/02357;;G02B6/02361;;G02B6/02371;;H01S3/0057;;H01S3/08013;;H01S3/235;;G02B6/02266;;H01S3/08013;;H01S3/0057;;G02B6/02304;;G02B6/02371;;H01S3/235;;G02B6/02357;;G02B6/02361,H01S3/10;;H01S3/13,372/25;;372/9;;372/30,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The choke (50) functions to position the input impedance of the high-frequency antenna at the base of the choke in a manner so that a short matching transformer may be used at the base of the choke for connection to the coaxial cable. In matching the antenna in this manner at the base of the choke, the best possible VSWR characteristics of the antenna are preserved and the radiation pattern of the antenna's main lobe extends horizontally along a horizontal axis.",ALCATEL NV,YARSUNAS GEORGE DOMINIC;;BRENNAN MICHAEL LEONARD;;HENDERSHOT JAMES RICHARD,,https://lens.org/144-173-382-232-840,Patent Application,yes,3,7,18,18,0,H01Q1/10;;H01Q5/40;;H01Q5/00;;H01Q1/10;;H01Q5/40,H01Q1/10;;H01Q1/32;;H01Q5/00;;H01Q5/15;;H01Q5/40;;H01Q9/30,,1,0,,,"H.JASIK ""ANTENNA ENGINEERING HANDBOOK"" McGRAW-HILL BOOK COMPANY , 1961,FIRST EDITION PAGE 22-5 - 22-7",EXPIRED

JERVIS B. WEBB CO. Feb. 27, 1965, No. 8533/65. Heading G3N. An overhead conveyer comprises load-carriers 16 associated with propelling chain 14, and unloading or like mechanism 18 adapted to be actuated by an electrical signal. Signal-carriers 20 are each secured to a trolley immediately in advance of a load-carrier, a recording station 22 impressing a destination code signal upon a signalcarrier by operation of unit 24 including key board 25. An erase element 26 is adapted to remove previously stored information from a signalcarrier. A magnetic code signal in a signal-carrier is sensed at read station 28, the mechanism 18 being operated in response to the passage of a signal-carrier bearing the code for that particular station. Each signal carrier 20 has a shell non- magnetic material and is coupled to the conveyer by a hanger bracket allowing relative movement transverse to the path of conveyer movement whereby surface contact is ensured between a face of the carrier and a guide plate of the recording station. Three magnetizable memory elements A, B, C, are mounted on the carrier 20 to form a specific pattern, a signal element S comprising a permanent magnet being spaced from the pattern so as to travel on a distinct path, Figs. 2-4 (not shown). The erase element 26 comprises electro-magnets which are normally excited with A.C., but this excitation may be controlled by switch 56 to prevent erasure, Fig 5 (not shown). The recording unit 22 contains three electromagnets EM-A, EM-B, EM-C, in the same pattern as the memory elements, as well as switch S-Rn adapted to respond to the passage of element S, Figs. 2, 3 (not shown). The reading station 28 comprises detectors 70, 71, similar to the switch S-RN, positioned to correspond with the memory elements A, C, carrying north and south polarities respectively. Memory unit B is unpolarized. Detector units at other reading stations are arranged in polarity and position to detect the passages of memory units having the polarities coded for those destinations, Fig. 9 (not shown). Twelve destinations are controlled from keyboard 25 which has unit-digit keys 1, 2, 3, and ten digit keys 10, 20, 30, for the energization of electromagnets EM-A, EM-B, EM-C. Actuation of key 20, for example, energizes a self-holding relay which in turn operates a further relay preventing any other ten-digit key from effecting the circuit. Connections in a diode matrix are set up to energize two relays whereby electromagnet EM-A is conditioned for north polarity and electromagnet EM-C for south polarity. When signal carrier 20 reaches recording station 22, switch SRN detects element S so that a capacitor is discharged through coils EM-A, EM-C. The re-charge current of the capacitor releases a relay to return the circuits to their original state, ready for the next recording operation, Figs. 6-8 (not shown). When the signal-carrier, magnetized with the destination code, reaches the reading station 28, units 70, 71, respond to operate the device 18.",WEBB CO JERVIS B,SCHENK ADELBERT JOHN;;KOHLS JAMES PAUL;;BRENNAN WARD THAYER,,https://lens.org/016-771-253-566-683,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B65G47/496;;B61L23/005;;B65G47/48,B61L23/00;;B65G47/48;;B65G47/49,G3N NG2           G2;;G3N N2            D;;G3N N250          D;;G3N N265A         D;;G3N N265A         G2;;G3N N352          D;;G3N N361          D;;H1N NET           NET;;H1N N330          QD;;H1N N343          QD;;H1N N360          NET;;H1N N360          QD;;H1N N367          NET;;H1N N367          QD;;H1N N639          NET;;H1N N669          NET;;H1N N669          QD;;H1N N744          NET;;H1N N744          QD,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In the two wire version, a hand-held reading unit is inductively coupled over two wires via a port located remotely from a meter register. Alternatively, a meter interface unit (MIU) may be connected directly to the register via three wires. Each register includes one or more wheel position encoders. An AC interrogation signal is applied by the reading unit to encoder circuitry at the meter which powers the circuitry and causes the position of each encoder wheel to be read. In the two wire mode, register display information (e.g. the current meter reading) is transmitted back to the reading unit by varying the load (impedance) presented by the register side of the circuit. This causes a corresponding variation of the amount of current drawn from the reading unit. The current-modulated signal is decoded by the reading unit and converted into a register reading. The system can also operate in a three wire mode and read older fourteen wire encoded registers. Other features include remote programmability of register characteristics, the ability to interrogate multiple registers which share a common data bus, verification of encoder wheel positions before accepting a reading, real-time flow rate/leak detection, pulse output, and the capability of reading compound meters (i.e. meters having two registers to separately measure high/low flow rates). <IMAGE>",SCHLUMBERGER IND INC,BRENNAN WILLIAM JAMES;;HAMILTON DAVID RALPH;;WYNN WARREN CANDLER,,https://lens.org/048-721-762-473-018,Unknown,no,0,0,22,24,0,G01D4/004;;G08C17/04;;G08C19/28;;H04Q9/00;;H04Q2209/60;;Y02B90/20;;Y04S20/30;;H04L12/00;;G01D4/004;;H04Q9/00;;G08C19/28;;G08C17/04;;H04Q2209/60;;Y02B90/20;;Y04S20/30,G01D4/00;;G08C19/00;;G08C17/04;;G08C19/28;;H04L69/14;;H04Q9/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   A device for interrupting or throttling undesired ionic transport through a fluid network is disclosed. The device acts as a fluid valve by reversibly generating a fixed bubble in the conducting solvent solution carried by the network. The device comprises a porous hydrophobic structure filling a portion of a connecting channel within the network and optionally incorporates flow restrictor elements at either end of the porous structure that function as pressure isolation barriers, and a fluid reservoir connected to the region of the channel containing the porous structure. Also included is a pressure pump connected to the fluid reservoir. The device operates by causing the pump to vary the hydraulic pressure to a quantity of solvent solution held within the reservoir and porous structure. At high pressures, most or all of the pores of the structure are filled with conducting liquid so the ionic conductance is high. At lower pressures, only a fraction of the pores are filled with liquid, so ionic conductivity is lower. Below a threshold pressure, the porous structure contains only vapor, so there is no liquid conduction path. The device therefore effectively throttles ionic transport through the porous structure and acts as a conductance valve or pressure-to-conductance transducer within the network.
