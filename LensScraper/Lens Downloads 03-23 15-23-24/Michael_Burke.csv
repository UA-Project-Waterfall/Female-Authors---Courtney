A blade is produced with a directionally solidified airfoil section and a fine grained root section and without a substantially inhomogeneous portion at the interface between the airfoil and root sections.,WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC CORP,BURKE MICHAEL A,,https://lens.org/018-159-068-004-226,Granted Patent,no,0,0,14,14,0,B22D27/045;;B22D27/045,B22D27/02;;B22D27/04;;F01D5/28,22-173,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   Both geometry and detail of an object's surface are simultaneously analyzed so as to generate a minimal set of data necessary to display the object with minimal visible errors at maximum drawing speed. All knowledge about the surface from high-level definitions (such as triangles, non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS), textures, etc.) reduced into an internal form (a surface map) is (i) optimized according to visibility rules and (ii) output as a minimized set of machine code (triangles with position, color and normals) to a processor, e.g., a specific graphic processor. Shapes and groups (areas of common lighting and material type) representing an object are first identified. Data in each group is then re-sampled as a vector-valued field in a parametric U and V grid space. The surface map is then optimized by removing data points in both the U and V directions based upon a visibility function that determines which surface data most substantially contributes to the perceived distinctiveness of the representation. After removing unnecessary data points, the points are reconnected to form polygons, which are then split into a set of triangles used to display the surface at high speed with minimal visible errors over a variety of scale factors.

In one embodiment, a conductive coil is embedded into the housing base, and a second coil is embedded into the filter element. Current is then passed through the coil in the housing base. Through induction, a current is created in the second coil in the filter element, in much the same way as a transformer functions. This inductive field may interfere with the operation of the various electronic functions, such as communications, sensing or other activities. To overcome this issue, an energy storage component, such as a capacitor, is included in the filter electronics. In this way, the power generated by the inductive field can be stored, and used when the inductive field is no longer present.",MILLIPORE CORP,GRZONKA MICHAEL T;;BURKE AARON,EMD MILLIPORE CORPORATION (2012-01-01),https://lens.org/047-304-950-714-698,Patent Application,yes,25,1,18,18,0,B01D35/143;;B01D46/429;;B01D2201/52;;B01D2201/56;;B01D2201/58;;H02J50/70;;H02J50/402;;H02J50/10;;H02J50/005;;H02J50/10;;H02J50/70;;B01D35/143;;B01D2201/52;;B01D46/429;;B01D2201/58;;B01D2201/56;;H02J50/005;;H02J50/402,H02J7/04;;H02J17/00,320/108;;307/104,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The slot divides the inventive covering layer into two parts and provides a vent opening that allows air to escape as fluid enters a cavity or sample receiving chamber formed in the test strip. In preferred embodiments, the covering layer is clear such that the user can see through it and the slot doubles as a “fill line.” The user can thus watch the fluid sample enter the test strip, progress through the capillary cavity, and then stop at the slot or fill-line. This provides positive assurance to the user that the sample size is sufficient and the test strip has been filled properly. The present invention also provides an advantageous method of mass-producing the inventive test strips without having to align the slot or vent opening laterally with respect to the test strips and without having to punch a vent opening.

The diagnostic processor can adaptively adjust an operating characteristic of the system electronics such as gain or time delay to compensate for a detected out of tolerance condition.",ADVANCED TECH LAB,BURKE THOMAS MICHAEL;;MEHI JAMES,,https://lens.org/163-290-050-915-479,Patent Application,yes,6,40,3,3,0,B06B1/0622;;B06B2201/40;;G01S7/52017;;G01S7/5205;;G01S7/52079;;G01S15/8979;;G01S15/8918;;A61B8/58;;G01S7/52079;;G01S7/52017;;G01S7/5205;;B06B2201/40;;B06B1/0622;;G01S15/8979;;G01S15/8918;;A61B8/58,G01B17/00;;A61B8/00;;B06B1/02;;B06B1/06;;G01N29/00;;G01S7/52;;G01S7/521;;G01S15/89,,1,0,,,"PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN vol. 13, no. 249 (C - 605) 9 June 1989 (1989-06-09)",DISCONTINUED

The radiation detector is automatically zeroed at ambient upon use and provides a readout of temperature rise above ambient throughout a scan of a subject. In one design, only one LED for each segment of the display is illuminated at a time. An audible signal is sounded at an increasing pulse frequency as the display is illuminated from the green segment to the red segment of measured temperature rise above ambient with a constant tone for temperature rises above about 20 degrees centigrade. In an alternative design a timing circuit allows the detector to self operate for a predetermined length of time. The detector sounds a `beep` tone before automatically shutting itself off.

The slot divides the inventive covering layer into two parts and provides a vent opening that allows air to escape as fluid enters a cavity or sample receiving chamber formed in the test strip. In preferred embodiments, the covering layer is clear such that the user can see through it and the slot doubles as a “fill line.” The user can thus watch the fluid sample enter the test strip, progress through the capillary cavity, and then stop at the slot or fill-line. This provides positive assurance to the user that the sample size is sufficient and the test strip has been filled properly. The present invention also provides an advantageous method of mass-producing the inventive test strips without having to align the slot or vent opening laterally with respect to the test strips and without having to punch a vent opening.

The circuit places constant load resistance on its source in all positions when driving a high-resistance load. The circuit is inexpensive to construct, comprising three attenuation resistors, two input resistance compensating resistors, and two single-pole double-throw switching elements for changing the series/parallel configuration of the attenuation resistors and switching the compensating resistors into the circuit. The circuit places all parasitic capacitance associated with the switches on the input side of the circuit, thereby providing uniformly low output capacitance for all voltage-divider ratios.

   The system for detecting the edge of a moving data storage medium measures the ambient noise level of the magneto-resistive read head when the magneto-resistive read head is completely off the magnetic tape media. The system for detecting the edge of a moving data storage medium sets a signal threshold that is a predetermined increase over the magneto-resistive read head output signal generated by the ambient noise. The system for detecting the edge of a moving data storage medium then moves the magneto-resistive read head on to the magnetic tape media, where an increase in the magneto-resistive read head output signal is generated due to the friction of the moving magnetic tape coming into contact with the magneto-resistive read head, causing an increased noise level. The resultant increase in the magneto-resistive read head output signal, when it exceeds the signal threshold, is indicative of the presence of the edge of the magnetic tape and can be used as an accurate measure of the edge of the magnetic tape.

    The system for detecting the edge of a moving data storage medium measures the ambient noise level of the magneto-resistive read head when the magneto-resistive read head is completely off the magnetic tape media. The system for detecting the edge of a moving data storage medium sets a signal threshold that is a predetermined increase over the magneto-resistive read head output signal generated by the ambient noise. The system for detecting the edge of a moving data storage medium then moves the magneto-resistive read head on to the magnetic tape media, where an increase in the magneto-resistive read head output signal is generated due to the friction of the moving magnetic tape coming into contact with the magneto-resistive read head, causing an increased noise level. The resultant increase in the magneto-resistive read head output signal, when it exceeds the signal threshold, is indicative of the presence of the edge of the magnetic tape and can be used as an accurate measure of the edge of the magnetic tape.
