The structure has a relatively rigid tubular housing 1 with a tubular elastic cylindrical member 2 within it where the ends of the cylindrical member 2 are attached to the interior wall of the tubular housing 1. The space between the housing wall and the elastic cylindrical member can be increased, for example by pumping fluid 8 under pressure into it, which causes the elastic cylindrical member 2 to distend and thus reduce the flow cross-section of the valve. Mechanical means may be used to effect such distention such as cords or wires with means to provide tension in the cords to cause the elastic member 2 to distend inwardly. The valve structure is particularly useful for use as a valve to control flow through an arteriovenous fistula made surgically and can also be used as an artificial sphincter.",BALATECH LTD,PAUL ANTHONY LEONARD;;DUNCAN DALGLEISH JACKSON;;EOIN BILLINGS,BALATECH LIMITED (2016-07-13),https://lens.org/123-288-202-172-94X,Patent Application,no,15,0,7,7,0,A61F2/0022;;A61F2/004;;A61F2/064;;A61M1/3655;;A61M2205/3334;;A61F2210/009;;A61F2250/0018;;A61B17/12131;;A61F2/0004;;A61F2/004;;A61M2205/3334;;A61M1/3655;;A61F2/48;;A61F2/2475;;A61F2210/009;;A61F2250/0018;;A61M27/002;;A61M39/227,A61F2/00;;A61B17/12,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
