The steps are angularly displaceable about a pintel post in progressive increments and are resiliently coupled for snap-lock engagement when in the fully extended position. A vertically extendible elongate handle is housed within the pintel post and can be locked at selected heights by a pressure clamp arrangement mounted at the upper end of the pintel post. The elongate handle can be folded about an articulated joint to a substantially horizontal position when in non-use. A sleeve member is slidable along the handle and can be positioned over the joint to provide vertical rigidity when the handle is to be used.,MODULAR IND LTD,CARMEL A PETER,MODULAR INDUSTRIES LTD (1980-09-23),https://lens.org/024-223-986-580-67X,Granted Patent,yes,6,33,1,1,0,E06C1/16;;E06C1/383;;E06C1/16;;E06C1/383,E06C1/16;;E06C1/383,182/106;;182/156;;52/187,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
