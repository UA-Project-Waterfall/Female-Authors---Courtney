In these applications, the refrigerant and lubricant must be soluble in each other (e.g., miscible) to ensure adequate lubricant circulation from the compressor, through the condenser, expansion device, and evaporator, and back to the compressor. Insufficient lubricant circulation will result in compressor failure. Low temperature solubility is particularly important to ensure lubricant flow through the cold evaporator. In addition, the lubricant and refrigerant combination should be stable in the presence of steel, and aluminum and copper containing metals.

STURMEY-ARCHER GEARS, Ltd. April 20, 1954 [May 9, 1953], No. 12983/53. Class 80 (2). A four-speed epicyclic changespeed gear particularly for the hub of a cycle comprises a primary sun gear 1a formed on a fixed axle 1 and engaging planet pinions 2 on a carrier 4 which are also in mesh with a primary annulus 5. Secured to the primary carrier 4 is a secondary annulus 4b meshing with planet pinions 23 on a carrier 25 which also meshes with a secondary sun gear 20. A sliding clutch member 15 is adapted to couple prongs 11a of an input member 11 either to dogs 4a on carrier 4 or to splines 5c on an extension of annulus 5. In a further position as well as engaging splines 5c it disengages driving pawls 6 on the annulus 5 from teeth 8a on the driven hub 9. The secondary carrier 25 is also in engagement through pawls 26 with teeth 27a on the hub 9. The secondary sun 20 is rotatably mounted and can be slid axially to engage teeth 25b on the carrier 25 and to thereby rotate therewith or to engage a toothed ring 30 engaged with the primary sun gear la to be held stationary. The sliding of clutch member 15 and sun gear 20 is effected through a selector rod 31 passing through a hole in the axle and acted upon by springs 34, 36. With the parts in the positions shown the clutch 15 couples driving member 11 to the annulus 5 for a direct drive to hub 9 through pawls 6, the pawls 26 being over-run. For an increased ratio drive, clutch 15 is moved to the left to couple carrier 4 to driving member 11 so that annulus 5 is driven at an increased speed to drive again through pawls 6. A first reduced ratio is obtained by moving clutch 15 to the right where it is coupled to annulus 5 but also disengages pawls 6 from teeth 8a. Annulus 5 therefor drives, through planets 2 and carrier 4, the secondary train 4b, 23, 20, 25 solid since sun 20 is coupled to teeth 25b of carrier 25, and the pawls 26 transmit the drive to hub 9. A second reduced ratio is obtained by moving sun 20 to engage toothed ring 30 which holds it stationary. In this case a further reduction is obtained through the secondary train from annulus 4b to carrier 25 and pawls 26 drive as before.",STURMEY ARCHER GEARS LTD,BROWN WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/026-507-313-603-926,Granted Patent,no,0,13,1,1,0,B62M11/14,B62M11/14,F2D DE10          DEK;;F2D DE11          DEK;;F2D DE46          DEK;;F2D DE50          DEK;;F2D DE52          DEK;;F2D DE72          DEK;;F2D DE75          DEK;;F2D DE78          DEK;;F2D DE82          DEK;;F2D DE83          DEK;;F2D DE85          DEK;;F2D DE86          DEK;;F2D D2D6F         D2DZ;;F2D D2D6J         D2DZ;;F2D D2D6M         D2DZ;;F2D D2D6R         D2DZ;;F2D D2D6S         D2DZ;;F2D D2D6U         D2DZ;;F2D D2D6V         D2DZ,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Insufficient lubricant circulation will result in compressor failure. Low temperature solubility is particularly important to ensure lubricant flow through the cold evaporator. In addition, the lubricant and refrigerant combination should be stable in the presence of steel, and aluminum and copper containing metals. This invention describes the combination of refrigerant difluoroethane (R-152a) and polar, oxygenated lubricants, particular polyalkylene glycols (PAGs) and polyolesters (POEs) which may be used as a ""drop-in"" replacement for R-134a.",UNION CARBIDE CHEM PLASTIC,BROWN WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/062-534-594-612-78X,Patent Application,no,0,0,7,12,0,C09K5/045;;C09K2205/24;;C10M129/74;;C10M145/26;;C10M145/36;;C10M171/008;;C10M2207/2835;;C10M2209/1033;;C10M2209/1085;;C10M2209/1095;;F25B2400/18;;C10N2020/101;;C10N2030/02;;C10N2030/12;;C10N2030/64;;C10N2040/30;;C09K5/04;;C10M129/74;;C09K5/045;;C10M145/26;;C10M145/36;;C10M171/008;;C09K2205/24;;F25B2400/18;;C10M129/74;;C10M145/26;;C09K2205/24;;C10M2209/1095;;C10M2207/2835;;F25B2400/18;;C10M145/36;;C09K5/045;;C10M171/008;;C10M2209/1085;;C10M2209/1033;;C10N2020/101;;C10N2030/02;;C10N2030/12;;C10N2030/64;;C10N2040/30,C09K5/00;;C09K5/04;;C10M129/74;;C10M145/26;;C10M145/36;;C10M171/00;;F25B1/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   Provided is a scent dispenser having two tubular, slidably engageable members. Openings in the inner tubular member allow scent to be released into the surrounding environment when the tubular members are in an extended position. An absorbent material may be contained within the dispenser to carry a preferred scent. Cooperating, nestable retaining detents, or, alternatively, a selectively removably positionable elastomeric O-ring, allow the outer tubular member of the dispenser to be held in any of a plurality of extended positions. A cord may be attached to the top of the outer tubular member to allow the user to hang the dispenser in a desired location. The scent dispenser may be provided in a bright color to allow the dispenser further to function as a highly visible marker for measuring the effective range of a hunter's weapons.

Cage lifts.-A safety gate for pit cages is capable of being collapsed and moved upwards and inwards and supported in the ' up ' position so as to give a clear floor space. The cage a is provided with two gates b of any suitable collapsible type. One end of each gate is secured to a vertical standard c fitting into a socket d in the floor of the cage, while the other end of the gate is secured to a vertical standard e also fitting into a socket in the floor, its upper end being reduced and slidably and pivotally connected to a socket f fitted in a cross-bar g of the cage. The socket f is rotatably mounted on the cross-bar p, and is provided with a rotatable cylindrical central portion f<1>. The opening through the socket is also widened at the ends to allow of the gate being tilted while withdrawing the standard c. An opening in the top of the pillar c engages the reduced end of the cross-bar g, and a locking pin g<2> is also fitted. After conveying miners, the door is opened by unlocking the pillar c, lifting it out of its socket and collapsing the gate. When not required for miners, the pillar c is lifted out of its socket, together with the collapsed gate, and is turned upwards and inwards, being held in the ' up ' position by a supporting- bracket h and locking-catch i. In a modification, the top of the standard e is provided with an elongated hole, and the end of the bar g is bent to form a hook and passes through the hole.",BROWN WILLIAM,BROWN WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/152-699-788-810-280,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,B66B17/36,B66B17/36,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

STURMEY-ARCHER GEARS, Ltd. Nov. 3, 1953 [Nov. 17, 1952; May 20, 1953], Nos. 28917/52 and 14118/53. Class 80(2) Relates to planetary changespeed gearing, for pedal bicycles, comprising a stationary sun gear 1a, planet gears 2 on a planet carrier 3 and an internally toothed annulus 5. Two pawl and ratchet couplings are provided, the first (5c, 17b. Fig. 1) between the annulus and an output member or hub 9 and the second, 6b, 6a, between the planet carrier and the output member. A slidable selective clutch member 22 couples an input member 14 either to the planet carrier or the annulus, in the latter position also rendering the first ratchet coupling 5a, 17b inoperative. According to the invention, the first ratchet coupling consists of a ring 17, separate from the selective clutch member 22, having two sets of coupling formations (17b, 17a, Fig. 1) complementary to coupling formations (5c, 12a) on the annulus 5 and output member 9, one such set of coupling formations (5c, 17b) providing ratchet coupling and the ring sliding to engage or disengage one or other of the sets of coupling formations, one set of the coupling formations being formed on the end faces of the ring and annulus. A sleeve 19 and pin 20 in a stationary axle 1 are slidable under the control of a rod 21 to move the selective clutch member 22 axially of the gear. The clutch member 22 has projections 22a engaging in slots 14a in the input member 14. The projections 22a can also be engaged either with dogs 3b on the planet carrier, by allowing the clutch member 22 to be moved to the left of Fig. 1 by a spring 24, or, as shown, with splines 5b on the annulus 5. When the clutch member 22 is moved 135 to the right as shown in the upper half of Fig. 1, it carries the ratchet ring 17 with it against the force of a spring 18 and disengages the ratchet teeth 5c, 17b. In this position, a step-down drive is obtained from the input member 14 through slots 14a, clutch member 22, projections 22a, splines 5b, the annulus and the planets 2 to the planet carrier 3 and ratchet clutch 6b, 8a. By allowing the clutch member 22 to be moved by the spring 24 to the middle position shown in the lower half of Fig. 1, direct drive is obtained,.as the input member is now connected to the annulus 5 and drive passes through the now engaged ratchet teeth 17b, 5c to the ratchet ring 17 and thence through the teeth 17a, engaging the splines 12a, to the hub 9. On allowing the ring 22 to be moved further to the left to engage the projections 22a with the dogs 3b on the planet carrier, a step-up drive is obtained from the input member 14, through the ring 22, planet carrier 3b, planets 2, annulus 5, ratchet teeth 5c, 17b, ring 17 and teeth, &c., 17a, 12a, the ratchet coupling 6b, 8a, overrunning. In one modification, a ratchet coupling having radially acting pawls 17d, Fig. 4, is provided between the ring 17 and the hub. In the extreme right-hand position of the ring 17 shown in the upper half of Fig. 4, a step-down drive is obtained through the input member 14, ring 22, annulus 5, &c. When the selective clutch member 22 is moved to the middle position shown in the lower half of this Figure, the ring 17 is moved to the left by the spring 18 and dogs 17g thereon engage dogs 5e on the annulus to give. direct drive. In the extreme left-hand position of the clutch member 22, the projections 22a thereon engage pinion pins 3a on the carrier for a step-up drive. In a further modification, radially acting pawls 30, Fig. 8, on a pawl ring 28 replacing the ring 17, are disengaged from teeth 31a in the hub 9 when the ring is moved to its extreme right-hand position for step-down drive. The ring 28 has lugs permanently engaging dogs 29a on the annulus 5.",STURMEY ARCHER GEARS LTD,BROWN WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/096-890-789-370-578,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,B62M11/14,B62M11/14,F2D DE10          EK52;;F2D DE11          EK52;;F2D DE34          EK52;;F2D DE46          EK52;;F2D DE52          EK52,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In these applications, the refrigerant and lubricant must be soluble in each other (e.g., miscible) to ensure adequate lubricant circulation from the compressor, through the condenser, expansion device, and evaporator, and back to the compressor. Insufficient lubricant circulation will result in compressor failure. Low temperature solubility is particularly important to ensure lubricant flow through the cold evaporator. In addition, the lubricant and refrigerant combination should be stable in the presence of steel, and aluminum and copper containing metals.

Change-speed gear. STURMEY-ARCHER GEARS, Ltd. July 16, 1953 [Aug. 2, 1952], No. 19616/52. Class 80 (2) [Also in Group XXXI] A combined change-speed gear and brake hub for the. rear wheel of a bicycle of the kind embodying epicyclic gearing with uni-directional type forward drive coupling between a part of the gear and the brake hub, and a brake having a brake actuating member and means for coupling said member to a part of the gear for actuation by pedalling backwards is characterized by having lost-motion coupling means between the forward drive coupling such as the pawl carrying rings 29 or 8 (Fig. 1) and the part of the gear such as the annulus 28 or planet carrier 5, whereby forward release movement of the brake-actuating mechanism relative to the hub is possible in spite of engagement of such forward drive coupling. Driving mechanism. In the construction shown in Fig. 1 the sprocket 26 drives a member 23 having axial slots 23a in which a selector dog 33 is slidably actuated by a rod 37. To obtain an increase gear the dog 33 is brought into engagement with an extension 4a of a pin mounting a planet pinion 3 on a carrier 5. The pinion 3 drives an annulus 28 which has a lost motion coupling with a pawl ring 29. The drive is transmitted through pawls 30 and ratchet teeth 21a to the end 21 of the hub shell 20. A direct drive is obtained by engaging the dog 33 with splines 28c in the annulus 28. A reduced gear is obtained by moving the dog 33 beneath the pawls 30 to tip them out of engagement with the ratchet teeth 21a, the splines 28c remaining in engagement with the dog 33. The annulus 28 will now drive the planet pinion 3 and the planet carrier 5 at a reduced speed. The carrier 5 has slots 5b in which are engaged dogs 7a of a cam member 7. A pawl ring 8 carrying pawls 9 and having internal splines 8a surrounds the cam 7. The dimensions of the dogs 7a and splines 8a are selected to give a lost-motion coupling between the cam 7 and the pawl 8. The drive from the planet carrier 5 is transmitted to the hub shell through the cam 7, pawl ring 8, pawls 9 and ratchet teeth 18b in a member 18 splined to the hub shell 20 at 18a. Braking mechanism. The cam member 7 is formed with ramps 7b for balls 11 which are also engaged in complementary ramps 12a in a conical-edged plate 12. Slots 12b in the plate 12 are engaged by dogs 8b in the pawl ring 8. A split internal expanding ring 13 is provided and has a conical inner surface complementary to the plate 12. A further conical-edged plate 14 is provided having an abutment lug 14a which engages with a slot 13b in the ring 13 to prevent relative rotation. A bearing member 15 has lugs 15a complementary to notches 14b in the plate 14 and further lugs 15b complementary to notches 16a in a torque arm 16. Action. When free wheeling or pedalling backwards the hub shell 20 rotates relatively to the gearing in the direction of the arrows shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The frictional drag of the ratchets 21a on the pawls 30 absorbs the lost motion between the pawl ring 29 and the annulus 28. When driving at a reduced gear, with the selector dog 33 underlying the pawls 30, the lugs 7a engage the splines 8a in the position shown in. Fig. 2 and the parts 7 and 12 are relatively in the position shown in Fig. 4 with the balls 11 in the deepest parts of the ramps. When free wheeling or driving with the dog 33 in either of the other two positions, the ratchet teeth 18b over-run the pawls 9 and the frictional drag of the pawls turns the pawl ring 8 to take up some of the lost motion between the splines 8a and lugs 7a. The plate 12 will rotate with the pawl ring 8 and the balls 11 will rise in their ramps and cause axial movement of the plate 12 to bring it into contact with the inner conical face of the brake ring 13. Backward rotation of the pedals will rotate the planet carrier 5 in the same reverse direction, and with it the cam 7. The frictional grip of the conical face 13a on the plate 12 prevents backward rotation of the plate 12 so that the balls 11 produce axial movement of the plate 12 towards the plate 14. The two plates force the brake ring 13 into contact with the member 18 to apply the brake. On pedalling forward the planet carrier 5 and cam 7 are rotated forwardly to release the brake. The pawls 9 are only brought into driving engagement with the ratchet teeth 18b after the lost motion between the splines 8a and lugs 7a (Fig. 2) is taken up by forward rotation of the cam 7. Similarly, the lost motion between slots 28b in the annulus 28 and internal projection 29a on the pawl ring 29 (Fig. 3) must be taken up before the pawls 30 will drive the ratchet teeth 21a. If the bicycle is wheeled backwards, the pawls 9 will be picked up by the ratchet teeth 18b since in an epicyclic gear the planet carrier always moves slower than the annulus. The plate 12 will be carried backwards at the same speed as the hub shell and since the cam 7 drags behind until 8a engages 7a it will also be carried backwards at the same speed and the brake will not be applied.",STURMEY ARCHER GEARS LTD,BROWN WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/011-251-350-315-463,Granted Patent,no,0,1,6,6,0,B62L5/04;;F16D41/30;;B62L5/04;;F16D41/30,B62L5/04;;F16D41/30,F2D DE10          EK52;;F2D DE11          EK52;;F2D DE34          EK52;;F2D DE46          EK52;;F2D DE52          EK52;;F2D DE6           EK52,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A liquid pump comprises a hollow body, 1, 15, Fig. 1, a relatively fixed part 4 having a truncated conical external periphery within the body, an opposed and relatively eccentric surface 9 on the interior of the body, an annular rotor 5 rotatable about the part 4 and having a complementary conical internal surface, a number of angularly spaced cylinders 6 formed in the rotor and each containing a piston 7 provided with a slipper 8 at its outer end for engaging the opposing surface 9, a circumferentially elongated inlet port 12 and a diametrically opposed circumferentially elongated outlet port 11 in the periphery of the part 4, and drive transmitting means for rotating the rotor 5, the arrangement being such that, in use, the slippers 8 will be maintained in contact with the opposing surface 9, and the forces acting on the pistons 6 will tend to cause the rotor to move axially towards the wider end of the part 4 to maintain a liquid seal therebetween. Liquid entering an annular chamber 16 through a tangential inlet 17 is passed to the inlet port 12 by an impeller 20 to reduce the risk of cavitation in the chamber 16. The impeller and the rotor 5 are driven by a shaft 19, the rim 21 of the impeller having slots located by teeth extending from the rotor 5. In an alternative embodiment, Fig. 3 in which the impeller is omitted, a carbon seal 33 is held against the rotor by the resilient tongues 35 of a washer 34.

Projecting upwardly from the base assembly at longitudinally spaced locations are a plurality of leaf springs with upper portions that support a trough assembly. The base and trough assemblies have masses, with the centers of these masses being spaced apart along an upwardly extending axis. The trough assembly is driven transversely of the upwardly extending axis by a driver. The assembly masses create inertia forces acting at the mass centers, and these forces form a force couple urging a rotational motion on the feeder as a whole. The leaf springs are arranged to deflect along non-parallel paths to guide the trough assembly in both curvilinear translation and rotation with respect to the base. This rotation opposes the rotational urge created by the inertia force couple to thereby eliminate rotational motion of the trough with respect to the foundation, so that the trough moves only in curvilinear translation with respect to the foundation.",FMC CORP,BROWN WILLIAM R,,https://lens.org/027-900-512-121-708,Granted Patent,yes,4,20,16,16,0,B65G27/08;;B65G27/08,B65G27/08;;F16F15/06,198/763,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Spring wheels with flexible rim with link connexion to drums having spring resistance to rotary motion.-Consists of further constructional details in the wheels described in Specifications 2262/10 and 30,038/10, characterized by a flexible tread supported on bell-crank levers connected either directly to springs or to spring-controlled inner rims. The tread band is built up of concentric spring steel bands 11, 15, 17, 18, Fig. 9, spaced by alternating blocks. The two series of brackets 2 to which the bell-crank levers 1 are pivoted rest on bands bridged by strips carrying a single central series of blocks 14 with the object of supporting the tread centrally. The rubber or leather tread 21. Fig. 13, is carried by a metal band 18, which may be detachably secured to a metal band 17 by stud-like keys 30, Fig. 14. The keys are passed through registering slots 29 and, after turning through a right-angle, are locked by a plate 31, which itself is locked by another plate 32. The edges of the tread are secured to the side covers 35, which are secured to the wheel frame at 40. The sides of the wheel are closed by inner and outer covers 42, 49, with inspection-doors. A flexible joint 44 permanently secured to the edges of the tyre cover has an adjustable wire edge 47 seated in the edge of the inner cover. The outer cover bears against packing 48. Helical springs 54 are placed between the outer arms of the bell-crank levers and the innermost tread band. A spring-controlled jointed-lever connexion is arranged between the levers 1 and the wheels 5 in order to reduce the recoil. The main springs 6, Fig. 1, controlling the wheels 5 are enclosed within casings and are connected by a link 8 to an adjustable point on a lever 7 pivoted at one end to the main wheel body and at the other end to a link 9, the object being to increase the strain on the spring with the displacement so as to obtain a uniform elastic resistance. The recoil of the inner wheels is clamped by the spring system 77. An adjustable initial tension of the helical spring 6, Figs. 6 and 7, is obtained by fitting between the coils thereof a thin helical spring 80, to which are secured packing - pieces 81. The main spring is duplicated at 83. The lubricating-system consists of an oil reservoir 92, Figs. 1 and 12, with a pump 110 and supply pipes 95, 97, 99 leading to the various moving elements. The supply of oil to the bell-crank lever pivots is controlled by centrifugally-acting valves 111, Figs. 9 and 11. A weight 120 on a rod 121 acts so as to open more or less through the sliding tube 116 the aperture 117 in the chamber 111. The pump rod 102 engages a squared spindle on the dipper 104, so that the dipper can be turned to reach the oil in any position of the reservoir.",BROWN FREDERICK WILLIAM,BROWN FREDERICK WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/061-196-723-924-304,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,B60B9/06,B60B9/06,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

In these applications, the refrigerant and lubricant must be soluble in each other (e.g., miscible) to ensure adequate lubricant circulation from the compressor, through the condenser, expansion device, and evaporator, and back to the compressor. Insufficient lubricant circulation will result in compressor failure. Low temperature solubility is particularly important to ensure lubricant flow through the cold evaporator. In addition, the lubricant and refrigerant combination should be stable in the presence of steel, and aluminum and copper containing metals. This invention describes the combination of refrigerant difluoroethane (R-152a) and polar, oxygenated lubricants, particular polyalkylene glycols (PAGs) and polyolesters (POEs) which may be used as a ''drop-in'' replacement for R-134a.",UNION CARBIDE CHEM PLASTIC,LOWELL BROWN WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/061-687-745-133-999,Patent Application,no,0,2,2,12,0,,C09K5/10;;F25B1/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

May 20, 1952. No. 12773/52. Class 39 (1). In a multi-cavity magnetron tuned by axially movable plungers, one for each cavity, strapping is provided at the ends of the plungers extending into the cavities. The tuning structure is dimensioned to resonate in the # mode at a frequency different from the operating frequency of the magnetron; the strapping prevents resonance of the tuning structure in modes other than the # mode. The anode segments 12 are provided with notches 35 to allow the strapped plungers 32 to enter the cavities. The strapping may consist of a pair of concentric rings 33, each connected to alternate plungers, the rings lying in notches in the plungers, or below the plungers, but connected to them by small extensions on the lower ends of the plungers. In another arrangement, all the plungers may be connected together by a single strap set in notches in the lower outer corners of the plungers.

A pair of opposed wiper pads disposed in a horizontal attitude are mounted in spaced vertical relationship within the container for longitudinal movement toward each other, to engage the vertical string. A double-acting pneumatic cylinder actuates each pad. Each cylinder is mounted in the plane of the pad, said cylinder being connected at its front end with the rear portion of the wiper pad and being pivotally connected at its rear end with a support member. The front end of the cylinder is thus adapted to rotate in a horizontal plane about its pivot connection, to accommodate transverse movement of the attached wiper pad. The container side walls are spaced from the wiper pad edges to permit such transverse movement to take place. Arrays of anti-friction rollers support each of the pads. The spacing of the walls, pivoting capability of the cylinder in a horizontal plane, and provision of the anti-friction means combine to permit transverse movement of the wiper pads. The head ends of the cylinders are interconnected by a line to enable air, displaced from one cylinder, to move to the other, to permit of longitudinal movement of the pads. The head ends of the cylinders are also connected with a pulsation tank, so that if both cylinders are simultaneously contracted by passage of an enlargement through the pads, there is little change in wiping pressure.

Scalding poultry. GAINESVILLE MACHINE CO. Inc. Nov. 29, 1965, No. 50527/65. Heading A2U. In scalding poultry the poultry F is conveyed through cabinet C in which the breast portion of the poultry is sprayed directly with water at one temperature by nozzles 28 on pipe section 25 and the other portions with water at a different, higher, temperature by nozzles 28 on pipe sections 22, 23, 24. The hot water sprayed on the other portions flows on to the breast portion and mixes with the cooler water sprayed directly on the breast such that the breast portion is treated with water at a temperature which will not cause the discolouration of the breast during the subsequent plucking process. The water drops from the poultry into a tank below the cabinet C, where it is heated by thermostatically controlled heater 35 and is pumped by electrically operated pump 36 directly to pipe sections 22, 23, 24 and indirectly via valve 37 where it is mixed with cooler water, to pipe section 25.

The laser ignition device has an injector housing with passages for flowing gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen to injector elements which mix the hydrogen and oxygen in a combustion chamber. A laser ignition system assembly is inserted through the housing. The propellants in the housing keep the housing and the laser ignition system assembly cool. A laser beam entering the laser ignition system assembly via a fiber optic cable passes though a lens for diverging the laser beam and a second lens for converging the beam. A portion of the laser ignition system assembly extends beyond the injector housing face plate into the combustion chamber of the rocket engine. A multi-faceted pyramid reflector at the tip of the laser ignition system assembly in the combustion chamber splits the converging laser beam into beamlets which emerge from the laser ignition system assembly parallel to the ignition face plate and ignite the propellant a plurality of points in the combustion chamber adjacent to the injector elements. A purging gas may be introduced inside of the laser ignition system assembly to help cool the laser optic therein and helps keep the laser optics clean.

Cette technique utilise deux antennes radar synthétique et un altimètre de visée placés sur un avion. L'avion se déplace dans un ensemble de trajectoires de vol sensiblement parallèles, chaque vol se situant directement au-dessus de la bande de terrain visée par le radar à ouverture synthétique d'un vol voisin. Lors de chaque vol, au moins une antenne transmet à maintes reprises des signaux radar dont les échos sont reçus à la fois par les première et seconde antennes. Ceux-ci sont traités de manière conventionnelle par radar à ouverture synthétique afin d'obtenir une carte topographique sans correction de l'angle de roulis. Les données de carte topographique non corrigée provenant d'un vol sont comparées aux données altimétriques acquises lors d'un vol voisin. Ceci permet d'utiliser les données altimétriques afin de déterminer l'angle de roulis lorsque les données correspondantes du radar synthétique ont été acquises. Cette mesure de l'angle de roulis est ensuite utilisée pour corriger la hauteur et la distance terrestre de points avoisinants sur la carte topographique non corrigée.

During each flight the at least one antenna repeatedly transmits radar signals whose return echoes are received by both the first and second antennas. Conventional synthetic aperture radar processing yields a terrain map uncorrected for roll angle.

The rolls are rotated by a motor 32 and belt drive 40. A stack of containers C is fed horizontally from a trough 55 through an electrically-heated unit 42 by soft rubber rolls 48 inclined to the axis of the unit and driven from the motor by a belt 53. The flange-receiving end of the groove in the roll 18 is slightly deeper than the remainder, and the receiving ends of the rolls 17 are reduced slightly in diameter to ensure the proper entry of the flange into the groove. The remainder of the groove is of constant depth and some of the convolutions progressively decrease in axial width to curl the flange.

[Cognate Application 17,577/10.] Metallic spring bodies and cores; block tyres. -A flexible laminated steel rim is supported by bell-crank levers, the inner ends of which engage tangentially the rims of drums rotating on the hub against the resistance of helical springs. In the form shown, three drums a<1>, a<2>, a3, Figs. B and C, are mounted on ball bearings. Each is fitted with a compound spring s', s<2>. At one end a lever b is pivoted centrally on a block b<1> adjustable through a bar e<9> fixed to the wheel body r<6>, Fig. A. The ends of the springs are connected by links to the ends of the lever. The spring s<2> is pivoted at its other end to a bar, fixed to the body and carrying a lever l<1>. The other end of this lever bears against a stop e<10>, which keeps the springs in tension, and pivoted to it is a bar connected to the spring s<1> and pivoted centrally on a lever e<2>. One end of the lever rests on a stop e<11> fixed to the body; the other end is connected by a pivoted link l to a spoke f of the wheel. The lever l is adjustable at both ends, and the arrangement is such that the leverage increases as the springs extend, with the result that the rate of increase of resistance is reduced and a long spring range is obtained. In order to damp the recoil of the wheel, an air brake is fitted. A cylinder n<4> is carried by the body. A lever n<6> divided into a long and short arm is pivoted at n<8>, and its ends are connected to a piston n<3> and a spring. To the centre of the long arm is pivoted a forked bar n<7> engaged by a stop on a spoke f. Further, a stop e' is provided for a spoke. The bell-crank levers e are pivoted centrally on rods u<1>, Fig. D, mounted in the body. The inner ends are connected by sliding tangential links c', c<2>, c<3> to the wheels. The outer ends are pivoted to brackets v<8>, which have rounded faces resting on the inner surface of the rim t. The brackets are pivoted laterally to clamps v<7> engaging the notched sides of the rim. Riveted to the clamps v<7> through a flexible cover j are plates m<1> with inwardly-turned edges which hold india-rubber block tyres m. The plate is formed with a central boss v<1>, and the block is further held by a screw v<3> passing through an embedded plate v<2>. The aperture of the plate and the screw are locked by means of serrations. Fitted in a groove in each block is a chain v<6>, the ends of which are respecively looped over, and hooked to, eyes fixed to the end of the plate m<1>. The wheel body consists of spokes r<6> stayed by plates r<5>. The sides are fitted with disks of metal or celluloid in which are panels removable for inspection of the interior. Stops e<4>, e<5>, e<6> are provided for the lever e and rim. In order to increase the spring resistance when the vehicle turns a corner, a block x<3>, Fig. 9, carried by a spring-controlled lever x<4> is thrown across the wheel and jams between a bar x and the end of the lever b, so as to put the spring s<2> out of action.",BROWN FREDERICK WILLIAM,BROWN FREDERICK WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/149-279-596-032-278,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,B60B9/06,B60B9/06,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Cranes.-Relates to friction gearing for cranes &c., characterized by the use of a stepped friction cone to vary the velocity ratio. This stepped cone c is mounted on the driving-shaft b, and is adapted to be engaged by an internally gearing drum d secured to a shaft h, which has a squared portion i<2> sliding inside a shaft i, universally jointed to the driven shaft a. Axial motion is given to the drum d through a bearing j, which is hinged at r to a rod q, actuated by a link p, bevel-gearing, and a rotatable handle n. The rod q slides inside a tube k pivoted at o<1>, and is rigid with a hollow lever l. In changing speed, transverse motion is given to the drum d by turning the lever l and tube k about the pivot o<1>. The gearing surface of the drum d is an elastic layer backed by a pneumatic tube f. Frictional engagement is maintained by a spring v acting through a quadrant m. An auxiliary wheel y may be rotated in the position shown in dotted lines at y', to produce the reverse. A modification is described, in which the shaft a is not in line with the shaft b, and the shaft h is mounted in a frame so that it rotates around the shaft a, keeping parallel to it. This frame slides longitudinally on the shaft a, and the drum d is geared to the shaft a. In the Provisional Specification, means are described for producing the reverse, comprising toothed gearing, a countershaft, and an idler pinion put into mesh by sliding axially or by turning on an eccentric bearing.",BROWN JOHN WILLIAM,BROWN JOHN WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/039-808-248-639-201,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Motor road vehicles.- Two wheels placed side by side and mounted in a framework attached to the vehicle are connected to each other and if necessary to a driving- wheel by a coupling which allows radial motion but no relative rotation, so that blocks on one tyre are kept in alinement with recesses in the other tyre, the object being to avoid an obstacle affecting the wheel as a whole. The wheels w<2>, w<1>, Fig. B, are supported on short axles a3, a<4>, carried by vertical members a<6>, Fig. A, of a frame f attached to the vehicle at a<1> through springs s, Fig. B. The live axle a<2> carries a disk wheel w<4> and is connected by a coupling, shown separately in Fig. 3, to a disk on the axle a<3> which is supported in the bearing member a<6>. The bars a<6> are connected to the framework f by parallel motions and by springs so that finally the wheels are resiliently supported, have independent vertical motion always parallel to the frame f, but always rotate together. As a further means, the wheels are connected inside their rims by four parallel motion devices m, Fig. 1, shown separately in Fig. 5, set horizontally in one wheel and connected to another four, set vertically on the other wheel, by means of universal joints m' connected also to four extensions on the coupling shown in Fig. 3, placed between the wheels. This consists of a floating cross c to which is pivoted on one side at e', e, two pairs of parallel motions n, n<1>, n, connected to one wheel at n<2>, n<3>, Fig. 1, and on the other side a similar set placed to act perpendicularly and connected to the other wheel. The springs, which separate the frame f from the axle supports a<6>, are supported by extensions a<10> on the latter, Fig. A, and are arranged so that all do not come into action at once, but with increased effect after a little compression has occurred. In Fig. C, the central spring is shorter than the others which hold rods s<7> formed with collars s<8> so that one half only of each spring becomes effective finally. In Figs. 11<A> and 11<B>, the springs are in pairs, so that one member comes into action after the other. They are connected to the frame at their outer ends and to the bars a<6> by the central fixtures. These springs may be replaced by pneumatic cushions. In Fig. A, additional parallel motions m<6>, m<7> are placed on extensions a<7> of the bar a<6>, or these motions may be dispensed with and the members a<7> extended to embrace the ends of the frame for the same purpose. In Fig. 7, the axle of the wheel w<1>, which has wire spokes, is formed with an annular web fitted into a recess in the hub b<2> provided with balls. The axle a<3> of the wheel w<2> is separated by balls from a bearing b in the member a<6> which is connected by parallel motions and springs to the frame f again separated by ball bearings from a cylindrical member u<1> connected to the axle a<3> by the coupling described, and fitted with a sprocket-wheel u<2>. In Fig. 12, each axle is tapered and fitted with bushes k<1>, k<2>, having tapered boxes, which may be adjusted to tighten the wheels on the axles. Driving is accomplished by providing the wheel w' with a cog-wheel r gearing with a pinion r' driven through a coupling fitted against a disk on its axle r<3>.",BROWN FREDERICK WILLIAM,BROWN FREDERICK WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/057-324-033-116-907,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Sept. 28. Motor road vehicles.-Comprises means for driving a spring wheel for vehicles and velocipedes consisting of two wheels placed side by side on separate axles enclosed in and separated by springs from a light steel framework secured to the axle, in such manner as to allow play of the springs. Each wheel has independent radial motion and a tyre formed of alternate gaps and projections, the object being to prevent any obstacle from affecting the wheel as a whole. The framework, Figs. A and B, has a lower horizontal part f<1> and an upper part f<2> passing over the top. On a driving-wheel there are additional stays f<7>, f<8>, Fig. B, fixed to the end of the main axle a<1> through which a live axle passes. The driving-wheel w may be chain - driven or attached to the live axle, and to keep the vertical motion independent a modified Oldham coupling or equivalent means is placed between the driving- wheel and a disk w<1> on the axle a<3> carrying the wheel w<3>, and also between the two wheels. The axles a, a<3> are supported in vertical bars x, x<1>, which are connected to the framework at each end by a parallel-motion device, shown in Fig. G, consisting of a plate v and pivoted links v'. Helical springs s, or carriage springs, are placed between the upper part of the framework and plates r secured behind the bars x, x<1>, which are also connected to the end of the framework by pivoted guiding-links c', c', Fig. A. The adopted form of coupling for transmitting driving motion between the wheels is shown in Fig. F. Pivoted links e<4>, e<5> connect the wheel at one side to a floating plate l<3> which is connected to the wheel at the other side (not shown) by the pivoted levers e<6>, e'. The tread projection on one tyre coincides with the gap in the other tyre, and may overlap to extend the whole width. Each projection may be of rubber secured by a plate and radial bolt, or may be of iron with rounded ends and rubber fillings let into recesses in the parts which first meet the ground and held by radial bolts. Figs. 10 and 11 show an additional way of connecting the two wheels by levers g<1>, g<2> which allow radial motion, limited according to the preceding. Fig. 9 shows a driving-wheel of a motor-bicycle. The hub m is recessed to revolve outside a tube n which has a vertical arm n<1> bearing on a spring and is fixed to the end of a controlling-arm pivoted at the bottom bracket. The driving-wheel w<9> is fixed on the inner end of a tube n<3> which revolves within a bearing n<2> fixed to the frame. The outer end of the tube n<3> drives the axle a through the medium of a coupling such as described. Fig. 14 shows an alternative form of parallel motion, and Fig. 5 an alternative coupling described in the Provisional Specification. Links l are pivoted at one end to one wheel and at the other slotted end to a crossbar P. Links l<3> are pivoted to the cross-bar and to the other wheel at their slotted ends. There is also an application e, e<1> of the Oldham coupling, the object being to get independent vertical motion along with the rotation.",BROWN FREDERICK WILLIAM,BROWN FREDERICK WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/066-411-555-375-211,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Cette technique utilise deux antennes radar synthétique et un altimètre de visée placés sur un avion. L'avion se déplace dans un ensemble de trajectoires de vol sensiblement parallèles, chaque vol se situant directement au-dessus de la bande de terrain visée par le radar à ouverture synthétique d'un vol voisin. Lors de chaque vol, au moins une antenne transmet à maintes reprises des signaux radar dont les échos sont reçus à la fois par les première et seconde antennes. Ceux-ci sont traités de manière conventionnelle par radar à ouverture synthétique afin d'obtenir une carte topographique sans correction de l'angle de roulis. Les données de carte topographique non corrigée provenant d'un vol sont comparées aux données altimétriques acquises lors d'un vol voisin. Ceci permet d'utiliser les données altimétriques afin de déterminer l'angle de roulis lorsque les données correspondantes du radar synthétique ont été acquises. Cette mesure de l'angle de roulis est ensuite utilisée pour corriger la hauteur et la distance terrestre de points avoisinants sur la carte topographique non corrigée. Ainsi, la correction de l'angle de roulis sur la carte topographique est plus précise que celle obtenue par mesure directe de l'angle de roulis.",ENVIRONMENTAL RES INST,BROWN WILLIAM M,,https://lens.org/090-880-967-582-702,Patent Application,no,0,0,8,8,0,G01S13/9023;;G01S13/9023;;G01S13/87;;G01S13/87,G01S13/87;;G01S13/90,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Wire. - In an apparatus for winding wire, especially large wire, there are provided special constructions for the reel, for the winding-onmechanism, for the tension device, and for the stopmotion. Two disks 5, 4, Fig. 1, having radial slots and curved slots respectively are superposed, and vertical rods 8 supported by rods 9 are mounted in the slots to form a framework, which can be expanded and contracted. The reel thus formed is loose on a shaft 10, and the wire passes over it, between vertical rollers 12, and over a series of guide-pulleys and a tension pulley to the bobbin. One of the guide-pulleys is mounted on the traversing shaft 19, Fig. 6, which receives motion from the shaft 24 through-the toothed and screw-and-nut gearing shown. The shaft 24 carries a double tapered plug 23, which can be put into gear with one or other of the oppositely rotating pulleys 22 by the shifting of the lever arm 25. In one form of apparatus, shown in Fig. 9, the shifting is performed by inclines 31 engaging a roller 30 on the arm 25, a projection 28 on which engages in slots. The projection is first freed from the slot by the engagement of a roller 62 with the spring 29 which maintains the projection in the slot. In the modification shown in Fig. 6, the traversing shaft presses springs 43 against the arm 25, thereby also pressing a projection 37 on the arm against projections 39 on a pivoted rod 38. When the rod 38 is depressed against the action of a weight by a roller 41 on the shaft 19 engaging knobs 40, the arm 25 is set free to be thrown over under the action of one of the springs. The starting-lever 45, Fig. 7<A>, is supported on a piece 46 which may be removed when the tension is excessive by the engagement of a projection on the slip-jack or tension-pulley device with a bent lever 44. This allows a lever 50 to be depressed under spring action to stop the rotation of the bobbin by a friction device and by a cord 57, Figs. 1 and 7<A>, to operate a lever brake 11 and stop the reel. When the slip-jack falls, it operates a bell-crank to operate in turn the brake lever 11 and a brake on the guide-pulley of the traversing shaft, thus compensating in tension for the slip-jack.",BROWN WILLIAM GIBB,BROWN WILLIAM GIBB,,https://lens.org/123-259-106-547-18X,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

In preparation for reactor refueling, the reactor coolant is depressurized and the temperature reduced to ~ 140.degree.F. Hydrogen is purged from the system and the coolant repressurized to about 400 psi to permit operation of a reactor coolant circulating pump. A solution containing oxygen, preferably hydrogen peroxide, is injected into the reactor coolant which is then circulated through the reactor. The thus oxygenated coolant effects prompt and nearly complete release, at least 95% complete, of radioactive corrosion products, especially cobalt 58, from the reactor internal surfaces. The coolant is then circulated through a demineralizer which removes such products by ion exchange processes, at the completion of which, the reactor is opened to commence replacing fuel assemblies in the reactor.",WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC CORP,BROWN WILLIAM W,,https://lens.org/018-471-663-623-386,Granted Patent,no,0,0,22,22,0,G21C19/30;;Y02E30/30;;G21C19/30,G21F9/28;;G21C19/30;;G21C19/307;;G21F9/00,359-37,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The technique uses two synthetic radar antennas and a ranging altimeter placed on an aircraft. The aircraft is moved in a set of substantially parallel flight paths where each flight is directly over the strip of terrain viewed by the synthetic aperture radar of an adjacent flight. During each flight the at least one antenna repeatedly transmits radar signals whose return echoes are received by both the first and second antennas. Conventional synthetic aperture radar processing yields a terrain map uncorrected for roll angle. Altimeter data from an adjacent flight determines the first order corrected aircraft roll angle when the corresponding synthetic radar data was taken. This roll angle is used to correct the height and ground range of nearby points in the uncorrected terrain map. A second order corrected roll angle is determined using the first order corrected terrain map to identify the first return point of the altimeter measurements. The measured altitude is then realigned to the first return point to produce a second order corrected roll angle and a corresponding second order corrected terrain map. The result is a terrain map corrected for aircraft roll angle.,ENVIRONMENTAL RES INST,BROWN WILLIAM M,ERIM INTERNATIONAL INC (1999-08-11);;ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF MICHIGAN (1991-08-29),https://lens.org/072-497-195-510-666,Granted Patent,yes,32,52,1,1,0,G01S13/87;;G01S13/9023;;G01S13/9023;;G01S13/87,G01S13/87;;G01S13/90,342/25;;367/88,1,0,,,"Studies of Multi Baseline Spaceborne, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radars, Li et al, Proceedings of IGARSS 87 Symposium, May 18 21, 1987.",EXPIRED

In the Figure, A, A<1>, A<2> are the switch devices of the contactdevices a, a', a<2>, B the feeder, R a track rail, C the collector, F an auxiliary shoe, and E the car motor. The shoe C is supposed to just have left the stud a and to be moving in the direction of the large arrow. If now, from any cause, a heavy surface leakage occurs from the conductor a to the rail R or other conductor, an arc may tend to be maintained at the switch A. As soon, however, as the auxiliary shoe F touches the stud a, another path is offered to the current, and the arc is then extinguished. Any suitable device may be placed in the conductor G in order to locate the boxes where leakage occurs.",BROWN WILLIAM MILTON,BROWN WILLIAM MILTON,,https://lens.org/080-007-476-037-890,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The clutch comprises a number of pump cylinders mounted in a casing containing the liquid, the plungers being reciprocated by planetary pinions engaging a spur-wheel on the driven shaft. Figs. 1 and 2 are a sectional and end view of the clutch. The engine shaft 1 carries a disk 2 having a cylindrical flange 3 closed at its ends by plates 4, 5. The disk 2 is provided with a number of bosses 6 within which are mounted shafts 7 provided on the one side with cranks 8 and on the other side with pinions engaging a gear-wheel on the driven shaft. The cranks 8 are connected to the plungers of four pump cylinders 15 secured to the disk 2, the valve openings of the cylinders being controlled by the reciprocation of a sleeve 18. As the valves are closed, the resistance to the plungers gradually increases, thus diminishing the speed of the pinions 9 and increasing that of the driven shaft 11.",WILSON WILLIAM BROWN,WILSON WILLIAM BROWN,,https://lens.org/129-978-365-097-362,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The technique uses two synthetic radar antennas and a ranging altimeter placed on an aircraft. The aircraft is moved in a set of substantially parallel flight paths where each flight is directly over the strip of terrain viewed by the synthetic aperture radar of an adjacent flight. During each flight the at least one antenna repeatedly transmits radar signals whose return echoes are received by both the first and second antennas. Conventional synthetic aperture radar processing yields a terrain map uncorrected for roll angle. The uncorrected terrain map data from one flight are compared with the altimeter data taken during an adjacent flight. This permits the altimeter data to be used to determine the roll angle when the corresponding synthetic radar data was taken. This roll angle measure is then used to correct the height and ground range of nearby points in the uncorrected terrain map. The result is a terrain map corrected for roll angle in a manner more accurate than can be obtained by direct measurement of the roll angle.,ENVIRONMENTAL RES INST,BROWN WILLIAM M,ERIM INTERNATIONAL INC (1999-08-11);;ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF MICHIGAN (1991-08-29),https://lens.org/007-573-495-645-858,Granted Patent,yes,37,43,8,8,0,G01S13/9023;;G01S13/9023;;G01S13/87;;G01S13/87,G01S13/87;;G01S13/90,342/191;;342/25,1,0,,,"Studies of Multi Baseline Spaceborne Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radars ; Li et al., Proceceedings of IGARSS 87 Symposium, May 18 21, 1987.",EXPIRED

When this occurs, the hauling ropes 17, 34 pull the blocks 14 further apart and cause the cable 20 to draw the torpedo 21 horizontally along the net until it is under the submarine, and it is then exploded. The exploding mechanism in the torpedo is operated by a Bowden wire and hinged levers; pulley arms and checking a.rms also are described together with the method of releasing the torpedo cab. e from the pulley arms. Torpedoes are arranged on both sides of the net, and means are provided to ensure the torpedo on the off side of the net being inoperative when the near side of the net is struck by the submarine. The horizontal wires of the net may be hinged in the middle and have hooks 36 and spring arms 37, Fig. 9, for holding the stay rope &c. 38 of the submarine.

June 5. [Cognate Applications, 15,292/13 and 25,259/13.] Reel and web apparatus. - Posters are progressively displayed at an aperture by a motor, which is intermittently stopped and started by a set of parallel switches n<2>, o<1> in a lead of t h e motor. A slatl at the end of a poster first operates a rod m and bell-crank m<1>, opens a switch n<1>, n<2> and then proceeds to engage one of the levers o and open a switch o<1>, thereby stopping the motor. The heavy bar n<1> slowly falls under the res t r a i n i n g influence of a fan n<5>, closes the switch n<2> and starts the motor again. When all the posters have been displayed, studs at either end of the band a of posters throw over a reversing- s w i t c h. The switches o<1> may be broken with a consequent closing at a contact o<2> of the circuit of electric lamps for illuminating the displayed poster. The levers o have flattened ends so that the momentum of the apparatus may not carry the slats beyond the levers o, but may stop and prevent contact o<1> from being made before the motor starts again. The posters may be joined up by means of slats t, Fig. 5, at each end, to which spring wires t' are attached with their ends snapped into metal strips t<2>, embracing the slats l. Each web-roller may have its shaft provided with means for preventing it from being driven except in one direction; this consists of a loose driven sprocket-wheel, Fig. 4, with oppositely-directed clutches f<3>, f<4>, adapted to engage a pin j on the shaft during driving operations at the shaft, and engaging a clutch part h, secured to the shaft by a clamp i during unwinding operations, so as to restrain the half-clutch f<3> from engaging the pin j.

Brown, W. M. April 28. Electric railways a n d tramways.- Relates to a switch for use on cars to which current is supplied on the surface contact system and for closing a circuit from a battery on the car through the magnet which serves to make the l i n e connection. The battery circuit is then opened, but, should the line current fail, the battery circuit is automatically closed for a short period, the switch finally turning to the off position. Figs. 1 and 2 show a construction suitable for use with the system described in Specification No. 28,225, A.D. 1897. An arm carrying a contact 4 adapted to bridge contacts 5, 6 is fitted on a spindle 2 operated by a handle 3. Normally it is maintained in the position shown in dotted lines by a spring 7, but, on turning the handle, the circuit is closed between the contacts 5, 6 and the line current closed. A magnet 9 is in this circuit and serves to hold the arm in the position shown by means of an armature 11. Should the current fail the arm swings back and makes contact at 5, 6, being held there for a period by the speciallyarranged dash-pot 12.

Ltd. 6 Jan., 1970 [13 Jan., 1969], No. 1990/69. Heading B3D. A device for removing projections, such as weld flash, from the inside of a tube 7 comprises a rotor 4, means 18 for rotatably mounting the rotor coaxially within the tube, one or more abrasive elements 14 mounted on the rotor so as to be movable in a radial direction, and resilient means 12 biasing the element or elements towards the axis of the rotor against centrifugal force, and controlling the distance of the element or elements from the axis when the rotor is rotated. As described, the elements are in the form of abrasive pebbles 14 mounted on cups 15 formed with stems 16 radially guided in the rotor 4. The cups are rigidly connected to leafsprings 12 having their ends secured to the rotor by caps 13, the springs urging the abrasive pebbles towards the axis of the rotor. The device is supported in the tube by a pair of seals 18 which are rotatably mounted on the device and act as bearings therefor, the seals containing cutting fluid which is supplied from absorbent material in an annular cup 17 during rotation of the device. A shaft 3, which is adjustable in length by being telescopic or having removable or additional sections is connected to the device and supported by discs 6 in the tube. The outer end of the shaft is connected to the chuck 2 of a variable speed electric motor 1 carried by a plate 19 reciprocated along guides 21 by a crankdrive 28 from a motor 29. The speed of the motor is adjusted so that the centrifugal force acting on the pebbles against the springs 12 causes the pebbles just to engage the tube. The motors are driven intermittently under the control of a timing device 30 to allow cutting fluid to flow to the pebbles. In another embodiment, the cutting fluid is disposed in an-annular reservoir in the device. The tube may be cooled externally by fitting a reservoir of cooling liquid around the tube.",APV CO LTD,BROWN WILLIAM JAMES,,https://lens.org/071-580-074-365-109,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,B24B5/40,B24B5/40,B3D D1J           D1J;;B3D D2A15         D1J;;B3D D2E1          D1J,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
