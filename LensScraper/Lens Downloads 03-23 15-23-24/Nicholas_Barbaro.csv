This integration enables key management security rules written to include the ECU's trusted physical location and trusted time in determining if and with which key a message should be encrypted or decrypted. Only appropriate messages for a bounded geographic area would be decrypted and received by the ECU. The trusted positioning system allows extending functionality to allow position-enhanced authentication capabilities. Outgoing messages are cryptographically bound with the ECU's trusted position information as well as an accurate time stamp.,PFAB ADAM W;;LEVAKE ANDREW J;;BARBARO NICHOLAS A;;ROCKWELL COLLINS INC,PFAB ADAM W;;LEVAKE ANDREW J;;BARBARO NICHOLAS A,ROCKWELL COLLINS INC (2013-03-14),https://lens.org/081-724-707-583-257,Granted Patent,yes,5,5,1,1,0,H04W12/04;;H04L9/088;;H04L2209/80;;H04L2209/84;;H04W12/64;;H04L63/0428;;H04L2209/84;;H04L9/088;;H04L2209/80;;H04W12/04;;H04W12/64,H04L29/06,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Cameras analyze the local real-world environment to produce a detailed terrain map which is used to more accurately locate the virtual training elements. The cameras also track the movement of the trainee by recognizing terrain features and deriving such movement based on changes from one scan to the next, and potentially based on GPS and inertial management unit data. A centralized computer system correlates terrain maps from a plurality of trainees and defines real-world locations for virtual training elements, then transmitting the virtual training elements to the plurality of trainees.",ROCKWELL COLLINS INC,LEVAKE ANDREW J;;PFAB ADAM W;;BARBARO NICHOLAS A,ROCKWELL COLLINS INC (2016-08-31),https://lens.org/031-601-168-544-465,Granted Patent,yes,6,0,1,1,0,G09B9/003;;G09B9/003;;G09B5/02;;G09B5/02,A63F13/00;;G09B5/02;;G09B9/00,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

An onboard computer system identifies critical events and translates such events into a force feedback pulse applied to one or more of the force feedback elements, warning the pilot of the critical event while at the same time suppressing more conventional critical event warnings that may distract a pilot. Additionally, force feedback elements are incorporated into a vest, bodysuit or body armor. A mobile, personal computer system applies a force feedback pulse to one or more of the force feedback elements to indicate an event that might otherwise require an audible signal.",PFAB ADAM W;;BARBARO NICHOLAS A;;LEVAKE ANDREW J;;ROCKWELL COLLINS INC,PFAB ADAM W;;BARBARO NICHOLAS A;;LEVAKE ANDREW J,ROCKWELL COLLINS INC (2013-06-03),https://lens.org/094-004-439-590-755,Granted Patent,yes,8,3,1,1,0,G08B6/00;;G08B6/00,H04B3/36;;G08B6/00,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
