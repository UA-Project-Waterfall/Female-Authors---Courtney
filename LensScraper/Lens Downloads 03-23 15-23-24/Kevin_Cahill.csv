A solenoid assembly is mounted upon the valve member for moving the valve member away from the valve seat. A mounting arrangement is interposed between and connects the valve body and the solenoid assembly in a rotary, frictional engagement.

According to the method, a request is received at a document management system for an item stored in a library. In response to the request, access rights to the item for the requestor are determined and usage rights are generated based upon the access rights. An encrypted file is then created that contains the item and the usage rights for the item. The location of the item in the library may also be included in the protected file. When an attempt is made to store the item back in the library, a comparison is made between the location where the item was previously retrieved from (as specified within the item) and the requested location in the library for saving the item.

A thickness of the first blade is smaller proximate the outer edge of the first plate than at the mounting pad to create a first gap between the first blade and the first plate at the outer edge of the first plate.",HORTON INC,CAHILL KEVIN;;STRAUSS ERIC;;BURCHETT DOUG;;DIDANDEH HOOSHANG;;SHOGREN CHARLES MARK,HORTON INC (2015-04-30),https://lens.org/176-972-617-354-298,Granted Patent,yes,224,4,26,26,0,F04D29/329;;F05D2260/941;;F05D2300/603;;F05D2300/61;;F04D29/023;;F04D29/388;;F04D29/646;;F04D29/384;;F04D29/34;;Y02T50/60;;F04D29/329;;F04D29/34;;F04D25/08;;F05D2260/941;;F04D29/329;;F05D2260/941;;F05D2300/603;;F05D2300/61;;F04D29/34;;F04D29/023;;F04D29/388;;F04D29/646;;F04D29/384,F04D29/34;;F04D29/02;;F04D29/32;;F04D29/38;;F04D29/64,,4,0,,,"US 8,251,661, 08/2012, Kilian et al.

The compliant element is tuned based on a load carried by the user.,SPRINGACTIVE INC,HOLLANDER KEVIN;;CAHILL NATHAN;;KINNEY DARREN;;CLOUSE PRESTON;;HOLGATE ROBERT;;CHURCHWELL RAYMOND,SPRINGACTIVE INC

The pulsed laser output has sufficient total fluence to initiate ablation within at least a portion of the targeted surface material and the pulse width is short enough such that the region and the non-targeted material surrounding the material are substantially free of slag.,GSI LUMONICS CORP;;GU BO;;EHRMANN JONATHAN S;;SVETKOFF DONALD J;;CAHILL STEVEN P;;SULLIVAN KEVIN E,GU BO;;EHRMANN JONATHAN S;;SVETKOFF DONALD J;;CAHILL STEVEN P;;SULLIVAN KEVIN E,,https://lens.org/093-372-395-443-835,Search Report,yes,5,0,14,16,0,B23K26/0676;;B41M5/24;;G06K1/126;;H05K1/0266;;H05K3/0026;;B23K26/0624;;B23K26/40;;H01L23/544;;H01L2223/54406;;H01L2223/54413;;H01L2223/54426;;H01L2223/54433;;H01L2223/54453;;B23K26/361;;B23K26/355;;B23K2103/50;;B33Y80/00;;B23K26/361;;B23K26/40;;G06K1/126;;B33Y80/00;;B41M5/24;;H01L23/544;;B33Y80/00;;G06K1/126;;H05K1/0266;;H05K3/0026;;B41M5/24;;B23K26/0676;;B23K26/0624;;H01L2223/54406;;B23K26/40;;H01L2223/54426;;H01L23/544;;H01L2223/54433;;B23K26/361;;H01L2223/54413;;H01L2223/54453;;B23K26/355;;B23K2103/50,G06K7/10;;B23K26/00;;B23K26/04;;B23K26/14;;G01Q30/02;;G01Q60/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The methods may include moving the media sheet along the media path and past a media width sensor that includes a shaft with a first upstream paddle positioned away from a reference location of the media path and a second downstream paddle positioned in closer proximity to the reference location. The first paddle is positioned a first distance from the first sensor, and the second paddle is positioned a second distance from the first sensor. As the media sheet moves along the media path, a first signal may be received when the media sheet contacts the first sensor, and a second signal when the media sheet is at the media width sensor. The distance the media sheet travels between contacting the first sensor and being at the second sensor may be determined. The method may also determine whether the media sheet contacted the first or second paddle based on the media sheet travel distance. Based on which paddle was contacted, it may then be determined whether the media sheet is wide or intermediate. The method may also include determining the media sheet is narrow if there is no receipt of two signals.",MADDUX THOMAS PAUL;;JARNAGIN CLARK EDWIN;;CAHILL DANIEL P;;SCHOEDINGER KEVIN D;;MICKAN DAVID JOHN,MADDUX THOMAS PAUL;;JARNAGIN CLARK EDWIN;;CAHILL DANIEL P;;SCHOEDINGER KEVIN D;;MICKAN DAVID JOHN,LEXMARK INTERNATIONAL INC (2007-08-24),https://lens.org/101-057-995-166-462,Patent Application,yes,0,9,1,1,0,B65H7/02;;B65H2511/12;;B65H2511/212;;B65H2513/50;;B65H2801/06;;G03G15/5029;;G03G2215/00734;;B65H2220/09;;B65H2553/61;;B65H7/02;;B65H2511/12;;G03G2215/00734;;G03G15/5029;;B65H2511/212;;B65H2801/06;;B65H2513/50;;B65H2220/09;;B65H2553/61,G03G21/00;;B65H7/02,271/3.13,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   A system for semiconductor wafer marking is provided. The system includes: (a) a first positioning subsystem for positioning a laser marking field relative to a wafer, the positioning along a first direction; (b) an alignment vision subsystem; (c) a laser marker including a laser for marking a location within the marking field with a laser marking beam; (d) a calibration program for calibrating at least one subsystem of the system; and (e) a controller.
