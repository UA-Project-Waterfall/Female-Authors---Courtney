The adsorbent particles are then electrochemically regenerated and recycled in the liquid to form an additional layer of oil contaminant on each particle. Subsequently, the particles are removed from the liquid and are regenerated by electrochemical oxidation. The method may comprise the delivery of contaminated liquid to a treatment reservoir 2 containing the adsorbent particles in the form of a bed of particles at the base of the reservoir. The bed of particles is then, preferably, agitated or fluidised to distribute the adsorbent material in the liquid and adsorb the contaminant therefrom. After ceasing the agitation and allowing the bed to settle, the adsorbent may be regenerated by passing an electric current through the bed which releases carbonaceous gases and water. The decontaminated water can then be removed from the tank. Preferably, the adsorbent material comprises unexpanded intercalated graphite. At least one of the oil contaminant and the aqueous liquid may be radioactive.",ARVIA TECHNOLOGY LTD,BROWN NIGEL WILLIS;;ROBERTS EDWARD P L,,https://lens.org/153-158-350-944-756,Patent Application,no,5,0,9,9,0,B01D15/02;;B01D17/0202;;B01J20/20;;B01J20/3416;;B01J20/3441;;C02F1/283;;C02F1/4672;;C02F9/00;;C02F2101/006;;C02F2101/32;;C02F2303/16;;C02F2001/007;;B01D15/02;;B01D17/0202;;B01J20/20;;B01J20/34;;C02F1/283;;C02F1/4672;;C02F1/28;;C02F1/40;;C02F9/00;;C02F2101/006;;C02F2101/32;;C02F2303/16,C02F1/28;;B01J20/34;;C02F1/40,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE
