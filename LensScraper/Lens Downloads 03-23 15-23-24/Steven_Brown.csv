    A system and method for providing dynamic configuration Read Only Memory (ROM) using double image buffers for use with serial bus devices. The dynamic configuration ROM may be updated while linked to the serial bus and with little or no risk of publishing inconsistent configuration ROM information to other nodes on the bus. The dynamic configuration ROM comprises first and second configuration ROM images, one set to active, the other set to update. The dynamic configuration ROM publishes the configuration entries from the active configuration ROM image. Modifications to the configuration ROM are stored in a database. The update configuration ROM image is constructed from entries made to the database. After the construction of the update configuration ROM image is completed, the dynamic configuration ROM switches the states of the ROM images and transmits a serial bus reset signal. Subsequently, the configuration entries from the newly active configuration ROM images are then published to the other nodes on the bus.

This assembly consists of an optical Raman probe and a penetrometer compatible optical probe housing. The probe is intended for in-situ chemical analysis of chemical constituents in the surrounding environment. The probe is optically linked via fiber optics to the light source and the detection system at the surface. A built-in broadband light source provides a strobe method for direct measurement of sample optical density. A mechanically stable sapphire window is sealed directly into the side-wall of the housing using a metallic, chemically resistant, hermetic seal design. This window permits transmission of the interrogation light beam and the resultant signal. The spectroscopy probe assembly is capable of accepting Raman, Laser induced Fluorescence, reflectance, and other optical probes with collimated output for CPT deployment.",UNIV CALIFORNIA,KYLE KEVIN R;;BROWN STEVEN B,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THE (1997-07-21);;LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL SECURITY LLC (2008-06-23),https://lens.org/160-783-627-096-751,Granted Patent,yes,7,34,1,1,0,G01J3/02;;G01J3/021;;G01J3/0291;;G01J3/44;;G01N21/65;;G01N21/658;;G01N2021/651;;G01J3/44;;G01J3/02;;G01J3/021;;G01N21/658;;G01N2021/651;;G01N21/65;;G01J3/0291,G01J3/02;;G01J3/44;;G01N21/65,356/301,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A flow switch for a high pressure washing system or other flow-related system is disclosed. The flow switch switches from an open to a closed position in the presence of adequate flow in a water or other fluid-carrying pipe. The flow switch includes a housing with a tubular bore, an inlet port and an outlet port which allow fluid to flow through the housing. Within the housing is a plunger with an attached plunger magnet. The plunger is responsive to fluid flow. A sensor is situated proximate to the housing. A sensor magnet is placed in position near the sensor and opposes the plunger magnet. A third magnet (the alignment magnet) is placed proximate to the housing. When there is no flow within the housing, the plunger is at its rest position as the alignment magnet attracts the plunger magnet to correctly align and position the plunger within the housing. When a threshold rate of flow is present, the force from the flow overcomes the attractive force of the alignment and plunger magnets and the plunger is moved to its secondary position. In this position, the plunger magnet trips the sensor when it repels the sensor magnet. In some embodiments, a display unit visually indicates that the microswitch has been triggered.

    A data processing and analysis system, and a method of using the same, for discovering implicit relationships in data. The method is executed in a computer system capable of receiving input data comprised of expert knowledge, empirical data, and user-defined constraints for any application domain. The system and method provide any pre-processing the input data may require, and perform feature selection and extraction on the input data. Further, the system and method generate a graphical representation of the implicit relationships in the input data, indicating relationships between both class variables and feature variables. Also generated is a classifier that provides a semantic and statistical justification of its classification results which further provides: statistical relevancy of the data set, including an indication of the undersampled regions of the data space; a data analysis specific to a desired level of confidence; and a sound decision theoretical foundation for classification thresholding. The system and method generate a classifier capable of classifying a sample with respect to any variable, handle missing data values, and provide a complete data analysis.

The rotor preferably includes a reusable aluminum support casing and a disposable plastic cartridge. The plastic cartridge includes a trap with partition walls to prevent wave formation in the rotating liquid contained in the trap. The cartridge includes an annular inlet through its top end, a winding flow path through the cartridge and an outlet at the bottom enc. The centrifuge housing includes an isolated sealed rotor chamber. Using the venturi effect, air is evacuated from the rotor chamber to provide a partial vacuum to reduce air drag on the rotor. Resilient rubber vibration isolators are used to reduce vibrations and engine induced shock loads from reaching the rotating element. A side oil inlet is provided in the cartridge to receive unfiltered oil at a location offset from the axis of rotation. Oil is feed in through the top of the centrifuge cartridge and discharged out the bottom. The rotor is carried by bearings on a stationary central support shaft. Maintenance is performed through a removable lid on the top end of the rotor. A restriction plug is used to control flow into the rotor.

   An environmentally friendly dual lube venturi filter cartridge which has no metallic components. A plastic centertube having a venturi section supports a bypass filter element on standoffs molded into the centertube. An outer concentric full flow filter element surrounds the bypass filter. The full flow filter is supported on a plastic centertube which creates a gap between it and the bypass filter. A first bypass filter endcap both seals the bypass filter and provides standoffs for allowing full flow oil around the bypass filter. The standoffs thus split the full flow which progresses through the primary filter in two paths, a primary path around the bypass filter and into the centertube, and a bypass path through the secondary filter and the venturi. Plastic upper and lower endcaps carry grooves for simple sealing gaskets, a radial seal gasket on the bottom which seals against both the endcap which carries it and a flange in the housing, and an axial seal gasket at the top.

    A circuit and method for sensing the inductor current flowing to a load from a switching power supply without using a sense resistor in the path of the inductor current. In a synchronous buck converter topology, the inductor current is derived by sensing the voltage drop across the synchronous MOSFET of the half-bridge and reconstructing the current using a sample and hold technique. A ripple current synthesizer is employed to reconstruct inductor current outside the sample and hold window. The sampled product I _{ Load } R _{ DSon } is used to update the ripple current estimator with dc information every switching cycle. The resulting voltage waveform is directly proportional to the inductor current. The inductor current synthesizer of the present invention can also be used in boost converter, flyback converter and forward converter topologies.

    A comparison circuit for comparing the desired voltage levels of electronic components and for disabling the supply of power to those components if the desired voltage levels are not equivalent. The comparison circuit receives the desired voltage level indication signals and provides a signal indicating whether the desired voltage levels are equivalent. If the desired voltage levels are not equivalent, the comparison circuit provides a signal indicating non equivalency to a power supply, wherein the power supply is disabled from supplying power so as not to damage the computer components from receiving power at a non allowable voltage level. The comparison circuit also provides an output signal indicative of an equivalent voltage level to the desired voltage levels if the desired voltage levels are equivalent. A power supply converter supplies power to the components at a voltage level as indicated by the output signal. The comparison circuit can be implemented in a computer system such as a multiprocessor computer system where each processor module provides a desired voltage level indication signal to the comparison circuit.

   A comparison circuit for comparing the desired voltage levels of electronic components and for disabling the supply of power to those components if the desired voltage levels are not equivalent. The comparison circuit receives the desired voltage level indication signals and provides a signal indicating whether the desired voltage levels are equivalent. If the desired voltage levels are not equivalent, the comparison circuit provides a signal indicating non equivalency to a power supply, wherein the power supply is disabled from supplying power so as not to damage the computer components from receiving power at a non allowable voltage level. The comparison circuit also provides an output signal indicative of an equivalent voltage level to the desired voltage levels if the desired voltage levels are equivalent. A power supply converter supplies power to the components at a voltage level as indicated by the output signal. The comparison circuit can be implemented in a computer system such as a multiprocessor computer system wherein each processor module provides a desired voltage level indication signal to the comparison circuit.

A plastic centertube having a venturi section supports a bypass filter element on standoffs molded into the centertube. An outer concentric full flow filter element surrounds the bypass filter. The full flow filter is supported on a plastic centertube which creates a gap between it and the bypass filter. A first bypass filter endcap both seals the bypass filter and provides standoffs for allowing full flow oil around the bypass filter. The standoffs thus split the full flow which progresses through the primary filter in two paths, a primary path around the bypass filter and into the centertube, and a bypass path through the secondary filter and the venturi.

    A compaction and transfer apparatus adapted to measure the length and/or weight of a waste log during compaction and transfer thereof, is provided. The apparatus comprises a compaction chamber, a closure device, a compaction ram, and a movement and/or weight detector. The compaction chamber is adapted to receive waste material. The compaction chamber has a discharge opening. The closure device is selectively movable into and out of the discharge opening to control the size of the discharge opening. The compaction ram is movable through the chamber to press the waste material against the closure device and thereby provide compaction of the waste material. The movement detector preferably is mounted on the closure device. The movement detector is adapted to detect movement of the waste material through the discharge opening, which movement corresponds to the length of the waste log extending out of the discharge opening. The weight detector is adapted to detect a total weight of the waste material in the compaction chamber and any portion of the waste log which extends out through the discharge opening. Preferably, the weight and/or length is used in controlling the compaction and transferring operation so that capabilities of a trailer are not exceed. Also provided are methods of measuring the length and/or weight of a waste log during a compaction and transfer operation.

Standard and control samples, each having a known concentration of the analyte, are assayed and a response, an amount of experimental indicator emitted for each sample, is detected. The unknown sample is also assayed and its response is detected. A prior probability density is supplied for the unknown concentration, along with a model for a standard curve relating an expected response to a concentration of the analyte. A posterior density, having a median, for the unknown concentration is generated based on the supplied prior density, the supplied model, and the responses for the standard samples, the control samples and the unknown samples, by applying Bayes' rule. The median of the posterior density may be provided as the measure of concentration of analyte in the unknown sample, with an accuracy defined by the standard deviation of the posterior density. The standard curve preferably accounts for relative error due to experimental variation by using a random variable to represent variations on the analyte concentration scale due to variability in the preparation of samples in the laboratory.

    A circuit and method for sensing the inductor current flowing to a load from a switching power supply without using a sense resistor in the path of the inductor current. In a synchronous buck converter topology, the inductor current is derived by sensing the voltage drop across the synchronous MOSFET of the half-bridge and reconstructing the current using a sample and hold technique. A ripple current synthesizer is employed to reconstruct inductor current outside the sample and hold window. The sampled product I _{Load} R _{DSon } is used to update the ripple current estimator with dc information every switching cycle. The resulting voltage waveform is directly proportional to the inductor current. The inductor current synthesizer of the present invention can also be used in boost converter, flyback converter and forward converter topologies.

   A filter cartridge which is environmentally friendly in that it is made up of components which are all incinerateable. The ends of a filter element are sealed using potting compound and plastic endcaps. The upper endcap, which is closed, has a pressure relief aperture associated therewith to prevent bowing. In a plugged filter condition the high-downward pressure introduced on the upper endcap is compensated by providing the cartridge with centering ribs which bottom on an associated ledge in the housing to provide a positive stop for the top endcap, preventing it from being driven down into and through the filter element. Rubber gaskets are associated with the respective endcaps, and are reliably secured to the endcaps by being snap fit into grooves molded into the plastic of the endcaps. The lower endcap utilizes a simple radial seal gasket which is both highly effective and also positioned to avoid structural crushing forces on the cartridge. A keying system prevents the installation of improper filters.

When there is no flow within the housing, the plunger is at its rest position as it is repelled by the sensor magnet. When a threshold rate of flow is present, the pressure from the flow overcomes the repellant force of the magnets and the plunger is moved to its secondary position. In this position, the plunger magnet trips the sensor. In some embodiments, a display unit visually indicates that the microswitch has been triggered. In some embodiments a third magnetthe alignment magnetis placed proximate to the housing. The alignment magnet attracts the plunger magnet so when flow is absent, the plunger is correctly aligned and positioned within the housing.
