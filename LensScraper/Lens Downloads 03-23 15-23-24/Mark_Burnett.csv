   A software controlled device comprises a central processing unit (CPU) and a memory unit. The CPU comprises a digital signature algorithm and a private key; wherein the memory unit stores run-time binary code. A digital signature is derived during manufacture from the digital signature algorithm, the private key and the run time binary code, then stored in the CPU and, in use, the CPU recalculates the digital signature and compares it with the stored digital signature, such that if the two signatures are not identical, the run-time code will not execute. A method of preventing fraudulent use of an electronic device comprising a central processing unit (CPU) and a memory unit is also provided. The method comprises passing run-time binary code and a private key through a digital signature algorithm during manufacture to derive a digital signature; storing the derived digital signature in the CPU; and in use, recalculating the digital signature and comparing it with the stored digital signature, such that if the two signatures are not identical, the run-time code will not execute.

SOLUTION: A CPU has a digital signature algorithm and a private key, and the memory unit stores a run time binary code. A digital signature is derived from the digital signature algorithm, the private key and the run time binary code when manufactured, and it is stored in the CPU. The CPU calculates the digital signature again when using it, compares it with the stored digital signature, and avoids carrying out of the run time code when the two signature are not identical to each other.",ROKE MANOR RESEARCH,BURNETT ALAN MARK,,https://lens.org/039-949-477-094-072,Patent Application,no,0,1,5,5,0,G06F21/71;;G06F21/71,G06F12/14;;G06F21/71;;G09C1/00;;H04L9/32,,0,0,,,,PENDING

    A pre-injury contact warning device for a front door of an automatic dishwasher or oven, the front door being openable to a generally horizontal very low position above the floor. In one embodiment, the device includes a housing attachable to a surface of the front door. A warning signal emitter sensorially perceptible by a person receives electric power from a miniature storage battery mounted within the housing. An angle-sensitive switch mounted in the housing is operably interconnected between the warning signal emitter and the storage battery. The switch is open and the warning signal emitter off when the front door is closed, while the switch is closed and the warning emitter on when the front door is open. The warning signal emitter, when on, is sufficiently sensorially perceivable to warn or alert the person nearby the dishwasher that the front door is open and to be avoided. Other embodiments are provided which are operatively dependent upon other forms of sensory perception, e.g. sound and touch or feel. This invention may be incorporated at the time of appliance manufacture or as an aftermarket attachment.

The website then encrypts the received machine specific information and sends the encryption back to the setup user's computer for incorporation in the cookie file located on the computer's hard drive. When a user attempts to sign in to access the account, the website acquires the cookie file located on the sign-in user's computer and machine specific information about the sign-in user's computer. The cookie is decrypted to reveal the machine specific information acquired during setup, and this information is compared to the machine specific information acquired from the sign-in user's computer to generate a probability that the sign-in user is the setup user.

    Steam turbine buckets have radially projecting tenons received in openings of covers. The covers are provided with a profiled surface, with recesses or radially outwardly projecting teeth, or both, to form a gap between the cover and a stationary component having increased pressure drop with resulting decreased leakage flow and reduced potential for solid particle erosion. In the profiled cover surface, the outer surface of the tenon and outer surface of the cover are machined to form the recesses or teeth, affording a flush cover/tenon design with improved sealing efficiencies and reduced solid particle erosion.

   A bucket cover to be attached to the tip of a turbine bucket has an aperture with an engageable geometry for receiving a tenon extending from the bucket and retaining the bucket cover to the bucket. The cover has an outer planar surface, an inner planar surface to abut against the bucket and an aperture extending between its surfaces. The aperture is defined by a sidewall that has multiple surfaces of varying cross-sectional size so as to structurally engage a tenon that is deformed during assembly. The sidewall of the aperture has a concave curved portion adjacent the outer planar surface leading to a narrow throat portion that corresponds generally to the size and shape of an undeformed tenon. In a method of making a turbine blade attached to a bucket cover, after a tenon is received in the aperture, the tenon is deformed by application of compressive force so that the tenon fills the aperture of the cover. The deformed tenon engages the various surfaces of the aperture sidewall to secure the cover on the bucket. The button head that is formed on the outer planar surface of the cover by excess tenon material is removed along with a thin layer of the outer planar surface of the bucket in order to provide a smooth, flush outer surface.

    A bucket cover to be attached to the tip of a turbine bucket has an aperture with an engageable geometry for receiving a tenon extending from the bucket and retaining the bucket cover to the bucket. The cover has an outer planar surface, an inner planar surface to abut against the bucket and an aperture extending between its surfaces. The aperture is defined by a sidewall that has multiple surfaces of varying cross-sectional size so as to structurally engage a tenon that is deformed during assembly. The sidewall of the aperture has a concave curved portion adjacent the outer planar surface leading to a narrow throat portion that corresponds generally to the size and shape of an undeformed tenon. In a method of making a turbine blade attached to a bucket cover, after a tenon is received in the aperture, the tenon is deformed by application of compressive force so that the tenon fills the aperture of the cover. The deformed tenon engages the various surfaces of the aperture sidewall to secure the cover on the bucket. The button head that is formed on the outer planar surface of the cover by excess tenon material is removed along with a thin layer of the outer planar surface of the bucket in order to provide a smooth, flush outer surface.

Each packing ring segment includes a brush seal insert and a plurality of labyrinth seal teeth along a concave sealing face thereof. Each segment is formed of a pair of components which, in assembly, have a split line through a slot receiving the brush seal insert. The brush seal insert includes a pair of narrow strips or rods welded to outer ends of the bristle pack and is bendable to a range of diameters. By forming forward and backing surfaces defining the slot integral with the components, the width of the bristle slot and the gap between the bristle pack and the forward surface can be readily manufactured and obtained.

    In a steam turbine, a combined brush and labyrinth seal is provided between a diaphragm web and axial projecting platforms on bucket dovetails at a location spaced radially outwardly of the outer diameter of the rotor. The downstream axially adjacent bucket dovetails also have platforms serving as complementary sealing surfaces to labyrinth teeth formed on the web. By locating the combined labyrinth and brush seal radially outwardly of the outer diameter of the shaft, thermal bowing of the rotor is eliminated. By providing backup labyrinth seals at the same radial location, axial thrust loads are eliminated in the event of brush seal failure.

    In a steam turbine, a combined brush and labyrinth seal is provided between a diaphragm web and a radially outwardly projecting platform between axially adjacent wheels on the rotor. The brush seal is located upstream of the labyrinth seal teeth. The platform has at least one and preferably a pair of flanges or fins projecting in opposite axial directions adjacent radial outer ends of the platform. Non-uniform heat distribution resulting from the frictional contact between the bristles of the brush seal and a sealing surface on the platform along the rotor surface affecting rotor dynamics is thereby eliminated or minimized.
