Spring wheels with flexible rim with link connexion to drums having spring resistance to rotary motion.-Consists of further constructional details in the wheels described in Specifications 2262/10 and 30,038/10, characterized by a flexible tread supported on bell-crank levers connected either directly to springs or to spring-controlled inner rims. The tread band is built up of concentric spring steel bands 11, 15, 17, 18, Fig. 9, spaced by alternating blocks. The two series of brackets 2 to which the bell-crank levers 1 are pivoted rest on bands bridged by strips carrying a single central series of blocks 14 with the object of supporting the tread centrally. The rubber or leather tread 21. Fig. 13, is carried by a metal band 18, which may be detachably secured to a metal band 17 by stud-like keys 30, Fig. 14. The keys are passed through registering slots 29 and, after turning through a right-angle, are locked by a plate 31, which itself is locked by another plate 32. The edges of the tread are secured to the side covers 35, which are secured to the wheel frame at 40. The sides of the wheel are closed by inner and outer covers 42, 49, with inspection-doors. A flexible joint 44 permanently secured to the edges of the tyre cover has an adjustable wire edge 47 seated in the edge of the inner cover. The outer cover bears against packing 48. Helical springs 54 are placed between the outer arms of the bell-crank levers and the innermost tread band. A spring-controlled jointed-lever connexion is arranged between the levers 1 and the wheels 5 in order to reduce the recoil. The main springs 6, Fig. 1, controlling the wheels 5 are enclosed within casings and are connected by a link 8 to an adjustable point on a lever 7 pivoted at one end to the main wheel body and at the other end to a link 9, the object being to increase the strain on the spring with the displacement so as to obtain a uniform elastic resistance. The recoil of the inner wheels is clamped by the spring system 77. An adjustable initial tension of the helical spring 6, Figs. 6 and 7, is obtained by fitting between the coils thereof a thin helical spring 80, to which are secured packing - pieces 81. The main spring is duplicated at 83. The lubricating-system consists of an oil reservoir 92, Figs. 1 and 12, with a pump 110 and supply pipes 95, 97, 99 leading to the various moving elements. The supply of oil to the bell-crank lever pivots is controlled by centrifugally-acting valves 111, Figs. 9 and 11. A weight 120 on a rod 121 acts so as to open more or less through the sliding tube 116 the aperture 117 in the chamber 111. The pump rod 102 engages a squared spindle on the dipper 104, so that the dipper can be turned to reach the oil in any position of the reservoir.",BROWN FREDERICK WILLIAM,BROWN FREDERICK WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/061-196-723-924-304,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,B60B9/06,B60B9/06,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

A steering motor drives gear 12 meshed with gear 18 to cause the steering effect. The front wheels 20 are driven by a motor 30 via differential 32 and clutches 26, 28 are located in the respective half shafts 22, 24. When the steering angle exceeds a predetermined amount, eg 45 degrees, in either direction, the corresponding clutch is actuated to disconnect drive to the wheel which is nearer to the centre about which the truck is turning. Thereafter the outside one of the wheels 20 is driven and the other three are free to turn in either direction or remain stationary as the vehicle is manoeuvred by the driver. The drive may be hydrostatic with a motor in the rear part driving a pump feeding a motor at each driven wheel. At the threshold steering angle, a spool valve cuts the supply to the inner wheel motor. Alternatively, the drive may be electric with an electric motor for each driven wheel, the inner motor being switched out of circuit at the threshold angle. <IMAGE>",TRANSLIFT MATERIAL HANDLING,BROWN FREDERICK LESLIE,,https://lens.org/131-622-188-128-74X,Patent Application,no,3,10,4,4,0,B66F9/10;;B62D12/00;;B62D53/02;;B66F9/105,B62D12/00;;B62D53/02;;B66F9/075;;B66F9/10,B7H HA            HA620;;B7H HXG           HXGREM;;B7H H101          HXGREM;;B7H H102          HXGREM;;B7H H103          HXGREM;;B7H H204          HXGREM;;B7H H205          HXGREM;;B7H H211          HXGREM;;B7H H215          HXGREM;;B7H H307          HXGREM;;B7H H620          HA620;;B7H H741          HA620;;B7H H744          HA620;;B7H H751          HA620,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Motor road vehicles.- Two wheels placed side by side and mounted in a framework attached to the vehicle are connected to each other and if necessary to a driving- wheel by a coupling which allows radial motion but no relative rotation, so that blocks on one tyre are kept in alinement with recesses in the other tyre, the object being to avoid an obstacle affecting the wheel as a whole. The wheels w<2>, w<1>, Fig. B, are supported on short axles a3, a<4>, carried by vertical members a<6>, Fig. A, of a frame f attached to the vehicle at a<1> through springs s, Fig. B. The live axle a<2> carries a disk wheel w<4> and is connected by a coupling, shown separately in Fig. 3, to a disk on the axle a<3> which is supported in the bearing member a<6>. The bars a<6> are connected to the framework f by parallel motions and by springs so that finally the wheels are resiliently supported, have independent vertical motion always parallel to the frame f, but always rotate together. As a further means, the wheels are connected inside their rims by four parallel motion devices m, Fig. 1, shown separately in Fig. 5, set horizontally in one wheel and connected to another four, set vertically on the other wheel, by means of universal joints m' connected also to four extensions on the coupling shown in Fig. 3, placed between the wheels. This consists of a floating cross c to which is pivoted on one side at e', e, two pairs of parallel motions n, n<1>, n, connected to one wheel at n<2>, n<3>, Fig. 1, and on the other side a similar set placed to act perpendicularly and connected to the other wheel. The springs, which separate the frame f from the axle supports a<6>, are supported by extensions a<10> on the latter, Fig. A, and are arranged so that all do not come into action at once, but with increased effect after a little compression has occurred. In Fig. C, the central spring is shorter than the others which hold rods s<7> formed with collars s<8> so that one half only of each spring becomes effective finally. In Figs. 11<A> and 11<B>, the springs are in pairs, so that one member comes into action after the other. They are connected to the frame at their outer ends and to the bars a<6> by the central fixtures. These springs may be replaced by pneumatic cushions. In Fig. A, additional parallel motions m<6>, m<7> are placed on extensions a<7> of the bar a<6>, or these motions may be dispensed with and the members a<7> extended to embrace the ends of the frame for the same purpose. In Fig. 7, the axle of the wheel w<1>, which has wire spokes, is formed with an annular web fitted into a recess in the hub b<2> provided with balls. The axle a<3> of the wheel w<2> is separated by balls from a bearing b in the member a<6> which is connected by parallel motions and springs to the frame f again separated by ball bearings from a cylindrical member u<1> connected to the axle a<3> by the coupling described, and fitted with a sprocket-wheel u<2>. In Fig. 12, each axle is tapered and fitted with bushes k<1>, k<2>, having tapered boxes, which may be adjusted to tighten the wheels on the axles.

Motor road vehicles.-Comprises means for driving a spring wheel for vehicles and velocipedes consisting of two wheels placed side by side on separate axles enclosed in and separated by springs from a light steel framework secured to the axle, in such manner as to allow play of the springs. Each wheel has independent radial motion and a tyre formed of alternate gaps and projections, the object being to prevent any obstacle from affecting the wheel as a whole. The framework, Figs. A and B, has a lower horizontal part f<1> and an upper part f<2> passing over the top. On a driving-wheel there are additional stays f<7>, f<8>, Fig. B, fixed to the end of the main axle a<1> through which a live axle passes. The driving-wheel w may be chain - driven or attached to the live axle, and to keep the vertical motion independent a modified Oldham coupling or equivalent means is placed between the driving- wheel and a disk w<1> on the axle a<3> carrying the wheel w<3>, and also between the two wheels. The axles a, a<3> are supported in vertical bars x, x<1>, which are connected to the framework at each end by a parallel-motion device, shown in Fig. G, consisting of a plate v and pivoted links v'. Helical springs s, or carriage springs, are placed between the upper part of the framework and plates r secured behind the bars x, x<1>, which are also connected to the end of the framework by pivoted guiding-links c', c', Fig. A. The adopted form of coupling for transmitting driving motion between the wheels is shown in Fig. F. Pivoted links e<4>, e<5> connect the wheel at one side to a floating plate l<3> which is connected to the wheel at the other side (not shown) by the pivoted levers e<6>, e'. The tread projection on one tyre coincides with the gap in the other tyre, and may overlap to extend the whole width. Each projection may be of rubber secured by a plate and radial bolt, or may be of iron with rounded ends and rubber fillings let into recesses in the parts which first meet the ground and held by radial bolts. Figs. 10 and 11 show an additional way of connecting the two wheels by levers g<1>, g<2> which allow radial motion, limited according to the preceding. Fig. 9 shows a driving-wheel of a motor-bicycle. The hub m is recessed to revolve outside a tube n which has a vertical arm n<1> bearing on a spring and is fixed to the end of a controlling-arm pivoted at the bottom bracket. The driving-wheel w<9> is fixed on the inner end of a tube n<3> which revolves within a bearing n<2> fixed to the frame. The outer end of the tube n<3> drives the axle a through the medium of a coupling such as described. Fig. 14 shows an alternative form of parallel motion, and Fig. 5 an alternative coupling described in the Provisional Specification. Links l are pivoted at one end to one wheel and at the other slotted end to a crossbar P. Links l<3> are pivoted to the cross-bar and to the other wheel at their slotted ends.

Sept. 29, 1917. Submarines, trapping, &c. - Comprises nets having torpedoes which are drawn into position by means of specially arranged cables and pulley blocks. Fig. 1 shows in elevation a net supported by floats 62, and Figs. 2 and 4 show in plan and crcss-section respectively the position of the net after being .struck by a submarine 16, the net being drawn away from the base cable 1. When this occurs, the hauling ropes 17, 34 pull the blocks 14 further apart and cause the cable 20 to draw the torpedo 21 horizontally along the net until it is under the submarine, and it is then exploded. The exploding mechanism in the torpedo is operated by a Bowden wire and hinged levers; pulley arms and checking a.rms also are described together with the method of releasing the torpedo cab. e from the pulley arms. Torpedoes are arranged on both sides of the net, and means are provided to ensure the torpedo on the off side of the net being inoperative when the near side of the net is struck by the submarine. The horizontal wires of the net may be hinged in the middle and have hooks 36 and spring arms 37, Fig. 9, for holding the stay rope &c. 38 of the submarine. A modification is described in which the bottom of the net is drawn up when required by electrically-driven screws.

[Cognate Application 17,577/10.] Metallic spring bodies and cores; block tyres. -A flexible laminated steel rim is supported by bell-crank levers, the inner ends of which engage tangentially the rims of drums rotating on the hub against the resistance of helical springs. In the form shown, three drums a<1>, a<2>, a3, Figs. B and C, are mounted on ball bearings. Each is fitted with a compound spring s', s<2>. At one end a lever b is pivoted centrally on a block b<1> adjustable through a bar e<9> fixed to the wheel body r<6>, Fig. A. The ends of the springs are connected by links to the ends of the lever. The spring s<2> is pivoted at its other end to a bar, fixed to the body and carrying a lever l<1>. The other end of this lever bears against a stop e<10>, which keeps the springs in tension, and pivoted to it is a bar connected to the spring s<1> and pivoted centrally on a lever e<2>. One end of the lever rests on a stop e<11> fixed to the body; the other end is connected by a pivoted link l to a spoke f of the wheel. The lever l is adjustable at both ends, and the arrangement is such that the leverage increases as the springs extend, with the result that the rate of increase of resistance is reduced and a long spring range is obtained. In order to damp the recoil of the wheel, an air brake is fitted. A cylinder n<4> is carried by the body. A lever n<6> divided into a long and short arm is pivoted at n<8>, and its ends are connected to a piston n<3> and a spring. To the centre of the long arm is pivoted a forked bar n<7> engaged by a stop on a spoke f. Further, a stop e' is provided for a spoke. The bell-crank levers e are pivoted centrally on rods u<1>, Fig. D, mounted in the body. The inner ends are connected by sliding tangential links c', c<2>, c<3> to the wheels. The outer ends are pivoted to brackets v<8>, which have rounded faces resting on the inner surface of the rim t. The brackets are pivoted laterally to clamps v<7> engaging the notched sides of the rim. Riveted to the clamps v<7> through a flexible cover j are plates m<1> with inwardly-turned edges which hold india-rubber block tyres m. The plate is formed with a central boss v<1>, and the block is further held by a screw v<3> passing through an embedded plate v<2>. The aperture of the plate and the screw are locked by means of serrations. Fitted in a groove in each block is a chain v<6>, the ends of which are respecively looped over, and hooked to, eyes fixed to the end of the plate m<1>. The wheel body consists of spokes r<6> stayed by plates r<5>. The sides are fitted with disks of metal or celluloid in which are panels removable for inspection of the interior. Stops e<4>, e<5>, e<6> are provided for the lever e and rim. In order to increase the spring resistance when the vehicle turns a corner, a block x<3>, Fig. 9, carried by a spring-controlled lever x<4> is thrown across the wheel and jams between a bar x and the end of the lever b, so as to put the spring s<2> out of action.",BROWN FREDERICK WILLIAM,BROWN FREDERICK WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/149-279-596-032-278,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,B60B9/06,B60B9/06,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

MINISTER OF TECHNOLOGY. 27 Jan., 1967 [31 Jan., 1966], No. 4117/66. Heading H4A. A conical electromagnetic horn has an oval cross-section in a plane at right angles to its central axis. The oval cross-section is symmetrical about its major axis and about its orthogonal minor axis, and may be elliptical. A means such as a rectangular waveguide is connected to the apex of the horn, to which it couples plane polarized waves having their electric field vectors disposed substantially at 45 degrees to the aforesaid major axis. It is stated that the radiation diagrams of the horn measured in two planes at right angles to each other are nearly the same and are substantially independent of the frequency of excitation, and that side lobes are reduced. Adjustment is possible by deforming the conical horn to alter the aspect ratio (major axis/minor axis) of its cross-section.",MINI OF TECHNOLOGY,BROWN WILLIAM FREDERICK,,https://lens.org/047-440-735-265-507,Granted Patent,no,0,2,2,3,0,H01Q13/02;;H01Q13/02,H01Q13/02,H1Q QDS           DS;;H4A A3W           -;;H4A A4X           -;;H4A A6G           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The gears then move, by a worm drive, the leading wheels of the vehicle into the required curve position and when the position is attained the follower disengages the gear. A second follower is connected to the front wheels and as they move engages another set of gears so that the rear wheels are set to an equal curvature as the front but in an angle opposite to that of the front in respect to the line of the vehicle and this follower disengages this gear as this position is attained. The rate of drive to both sets of gears is made variable and proportional to the angle of steering set by the driver so that the steering set of the wheels is attained in the same travel distance for all circles of steering and the gears and worm drive will be arranged so that this distance is the same as that between the leading and trailing wheels. <IMAGE>",BROWN FREDERICK JOHN,BROWN FREDERICK JOHN,,https://lens.org/162-540-753-139-405,Patent Application,no,0,0,2,2,0,B62D7/1527,B62D7/15,B7H HFA           HFA;;B7H H4F1          H4;;B7H H4GX          H4;;B7H H4X           H4;;B7H H851          HFA;;B7H H871          HFA;;B7H H873          HFA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Wheels with two or more rims or tyres side by side; securing on and detaching from axles; tyres, elastic other than pneumatic. - Relates to the type of wheel described in Specifications Nos. 19,592 and 23,755, A.D. 1905, in which twin wheels are placed side by side in a framework fixed to the main axle. Each revolves on a separate axle supported by springs, and they are connected by a coupling so that they move up and down independently but rotate together. According to the present invention, the periphery of each wheel is a convex curve alternately of less and greater curvature, and the two wheels are so arranged that the prominent parts t, Fig. A of one wheel come opposite to the flatter-parts v of the other. The treads t are of iron, wood, or hard india-rubber ; the parts v are of soft elastic material, and may be hollow or stuffed with a soft core ; the parts v<1> are of intermediate hardness. The wheel is fitted. with a metal rim r, Fig. E, and projections r' are brazed to it to hold the treads t fixed within plates r<2> secured by radial bolts r<3>. The part v may be held by a steel plate or band r<4>, Fig. F, or may be cemented, and may be recessed on its periphery. Each wheel has preferably four treads t, although there may be five or six. In the form shown in Fig. J, axles a<4>, a<5> are supported by bars a<6> separated from the frameworkf by springs s<1>, s<2>, Fig. K, and connected thereto by bars m<5> giving parallel motions in vertical alinement, and by others attached to horizontal arms on the bars a<6>. These bars may be replaced by pin-and-slot connexions. The axle a<4> is formed with an inner flange holding the wheel on ball bearings, and is screwed into a boss on the bar a<6> so as to be removable. The wheels are coupled by an Oldham coupling placed centrally, as also are the disks w<5>, w<6>, as described in the above-mentioned Specification. The axle a<1> carries ordinary carriage springs s, and is bent up and over at a<12> so as to rest on the frame f. Plates f<1> connect the axle to rods f<2> diverging to the frame. The mud guard g is bent to the form shown to accommodate the part a<12>. Figs. G and H show the arrangement of a steering- wheel, in which the end of the axle a<12> is pivoted to the centre of the top of the frame, and the plates f hold a pivot engaging the centre of the bar u linked to the centres of the ends of the frame. The bar u<1> is continued across the front of the vehicle to the corresponding part of the other frame ; or, as shown, a bar u<4> may be added, the object being to enable the frame to turn about a centre u<3> under the pivot a<12>. The steering- mechanism may be attached to the bar u. Preferably, springs s<1>, Fig. K, are used in combination with the springs s<2>. In the arrangement shown in Fig. 5, two toggle levers e<2>, pivoted to the bar a<6> and frame, press the blocks e apart as the bar rises. As shown in Fig. K, the bar is pivoted to the toggle lever e<2>, which is pivoted to the frame and to a rod e<3>, pivoted to the frame through a link e<1> and to a plate pressing on the spring. Fig. N shows a similar arrangement in which the lever e<3> is pivoted at one end to the framework.

Brown, F., and Stedman, F. J. Oct. 6. Oxygen.-In an apparatus for producing oxygen and other gases by the action of heat on a chemical body, separate charges of the body are moved automatically and successively above the flame. A base-board A has fixed on it guide uprights A', along which run rollers A<4> connected to a second board A', rising and falling as the collapsable gas bag B, which is provided with a central rubber band B<1>, is filled or emptied with gas. The top board carries the generating-apparatus, consisting of a box C, having at one end a tube C<8>, into which a number of the cartridges or cakes of the chemical are placed, and from the lower part of which they are moved forwards over the lamp D by a cam mounted upon the shaft E. This shaft is operated to move the cam by means of a lever G adjustably mounted upon the shaft, the end of the lever resting upon or in the puide A<7> in such a manner that, as the generating-apparatus rises in consequence of the holder filling with gas, the cam is moved away from the cartridge, a spring H ensuring this movement, while, as the generating-apparatus falls, the lever causes the cam to move inwards and force the next cartridge over the flame. A rod C<12> rests upon the cartridges, and is marked with indicating-numerals, so that the operator can see how many cartridges are still unused. The used cartridges are pushed forwards to the receptacle C<1>. The generated gas passes through the tube C<7> to the gas holder, and leaves the holder by the outlet A<5>. Instead of a cam, a plunger, rack and pinion, lever or levers, spring or springs, or other means may be adopted for feeding the cakes forwards, and the feeding-tube may be differently arranged. The feeding - mechanism may be operated by clockwork or other means.",BROWN FREDERICK;;STEDMAN FREDERICK JOSEPH,BROWN FREDERICK;;STEDMAN FREDERICK JOSEPH,,https://lens.org/026-595-925-537-248,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

    A vertical take-off and landing aircraft having a wing fitted, in the preferred embodiment, with two nacelles one port and one starboard, each nacelle having two tiltmotors in tandem, one forward and one aft of the wing. A conventional rudder and high set tailplane is fitted or, in another embodiment forward canards or in yet another embodiment the aircraft is a flying wing. 

    Forward tiltmotors can be tilted up past the vertical and the aft pusher tiltmotors can be tilted down past the vertical so that the aircraft can maintain a steep descent with the propeller discs horizontal and a low angle of attack of the wing. 

    Each engine is fitted with a two bladed variable pitch propeller that feathers to stop vertically, other embodiments have cyclic pitch propellers. The tiltmotors, have a sideways cant in the tilted positions to reduce engine side loads in translation. 

    All the tiltmotors are equipped with emergency electric motors that can be used to shift the center of lift in hover and assist in gust control. 

    A small wing is provided with very large flaps that are moved in synchronization with the tiltmotors to allow a clear downdraft and also act as a dive brake. 

    A tricycle undercarriage has long nacelle legs to provide ground clearance for the aft propellers and is equipped with side-load sensors for weathercock control. 

    An auto-pilot controls all phases of flight and has a manual back-up control system. 

    Special programs control weathercock effects on landing and take-off, and operation of the emergency electric motors.

A coin f, Fig. 3, on passing down the shoot b<1>, turns the toothed wheel d through one tenth of a revolution, and so operates the pointer c, Fig. 4. On the tenth coin being inserted, a pawl g engages a wheel h with ten teeth, mounted on the spindle h' of the pointer c<1>. Hundreds are recorded by the pointer c<2> on the spindle i<1>, which carries a toothed wheel i operated by the pawl h<2> on the spindle h<1>. A spring pawl d<2> prevents the wheel d from being accidentally rotated, and ensures its stopping in the correct position, the wheels h, i being similarly controlled if required. In the arrangement shown, when the hundredth coin is inserted, the projection n<1>, Fig. 5, of the cam n on the spindle h<1> raises the arm m and disengages the catch j from the lid a<1> against the action of the spring l, thus causing the lid to fly open under the influence of a spring, preferably arranged at the hinge.",JONES FREDERICK;;BROWN JOSHUA,JONES FREDERICK;;BROWN JOSHUA,,https://lens.org/167-980-153-131-62X,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

A conventional rudder and high set tailplane is fitted or, in another embodiment forward canards or in yet another embodiment the aircraft is a flying wing. 

   Forward tiltmotors can be tilted up past the vertical and the aft pusher tiltmotors can be tilted down past the vertical so that the aircraft can maintain a steep descent with the propeller discs horizontal and a low angle of attack of the wing. 

   Each engine is fitted with a two bladed variable pitch propeller that feathers to stop vertically, other embodiments have cyclic pitch propellers. The tiltmotors have a sideways cant in the tilted positions to reduce engine side loads in translation. 

   All the tiltmotors are equipped with emergency electric motors that can be used to shift the center of lift in hover and assist in gust control. 

   A small wing is provided with very large flaps that are moved in synchronization with the tiltmotors to allow a clear downdraft and also act as a dive brake. 

   A tricycle undercarriage has long nacelle legs to provide ground clearance for the aft propellers and is equipped with side-load sensors for weathercock control. 

   An auto-pilot controls all phases of flight and has a manual back-up control system. Special programs control weathercock effects on landing and take-off, and operation of the emergency electric motors.

The molecular proportion of formaldehyde to urea may be as much as 4 to 1. The urea and formaldehyde may be reacted first and the product reacted with the glyoxal or the monourein formed by reacting urea and glyoxal (from which glyoxal diurein and impurities have been removed) may be reacted with formaldehyde, or the components may be reacted together simultaneously. The impregnating liquor may have a pH of 6 to 8. Catalysts specified are tartaric and boric acids and magnesium and ammonium di-hydrogen phosphates. The resin may be formed in an atmosphere of superheated steam or the fabric may be treated with steam after resin formation. The fabric may be embossed, glazed, creased or otherwise mechanically treated before forming the resin. The fabric may be composed wholly or partly of cotton, linen or regenerated cellulose and may be subjected subsequently to a swelling or shrinking treatment with caustic soda, as described in Specification 437,361, and may then be further treated with a resin, which may also be a resin from at least 2.5 mols. of formaldehyde, 1 mol. of urea and at least 1 mol. of glyoxal. In Example (3) (B), a stearamidomethylol melamine softener is added to the treating solution. Specification 744,991 also is referred to.ALSO:A resin (formed in situ upon cellulosic textiles) is formed from at least 2.5 mols. of formaldehyde, 1 mol. of urea and at least 1 mol. of glyoxal. Resin formation is promoted by heating in the presence of an acid catalyst, tartaric and boric acids and ammonium and magnesium di-hydrogen phosphates being specified. Textile impregnating solutions have a pH of 6 to 8 and may comprise a reaction product formed by reacting the components simultaneously, or by first reacting the urea with the formaldehyde and subsequently reacting the product with glyoxal or by reacting the monourein obtained from urea and glyoxal (from which glyoxal diurein and other impurities are removed) with formaldehyde. Molecular proportions of up to 4 of formaldehyde to 1 of each of the other components are specified. The examples describe the formation of resin-containing impregnating solutions. In Example (5) a crystallized glyoxal monourein having a melting point of 146 DEG C. is obtained from glyoxal and urea and is dissolved in a formaldehyde solution to which calcium hydroxide is added to give a pH of 8.3. After standing, calcium is precipitated by adding oxalic acid until a pH of 7 is obtained.

In a more specific implementation, the module further includes a switch connected to the first coupler. The switch is a single-pole double throw switch. Each coupler is a 90-degree coupler that provides the combined energy output by each amplifier to a first or a second output port based on the position of the switch. The first coupler has first and second inputs, each input connected to a throw of the switch. The inclusion of a variable phase shifter allows for the module to be used to drive an element of a phased array antenna. For high power applications, multiple such inventive modules may be used to drive the elements of one or more phased arrays, pointed in different directions, to provide a desired coverage pattern. In this application, each module is adapted to switch energy at low power levels to drive one or more apertures at high power levels. The modules can also be configured as receive only or with circulators as transmit/receive modules. The inventive method provides a technique for switching power at high levels to and from phase array and other antennas and a technique for providing area coverage using multiple phase array antenna arrangements.",BROWN KENNETH W;;AHRENS FREDERICK,BROWN KENNETH W;;AHRENS FREDERICK,RAYTHEON COMPANY (2007-03-06),https://lens.org/143-415-524-011-211,Patent Application,yes,9,16,7,7,0,H01Q25/005;;H01Q25/005;;H01Q21/0025;;H01Q21/0025;;H01Q21/061;;H01Q21/061;;H03F1/0277;;H03F1/0277;;H03F3/24;;H03F3/24;;H03F3/602;;H03F3/602;;H03F3/68;;H03F3/68;;H03F2200/192;;H03F2200/192;;H03F2200/198;;H03F2200/198,H01Q3/26,342/374,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The electrically conductive handle eliminates the previously used dedicated electrical contacts. The current interrupter has a spring (29), known as a charging spring, to enhance its opening sequence. The charging spring in conjunction with the guide springs in the interrupter provides an added opening force allowing the internal contacts of the current interrupter to open faster, thus reducing the amount of internal arcing experienced by the current interrupter. The interrupter has a driving bracket a portion of which is electrically conductive. As the handle moves along the conductive portion of the driving bracket, the contacts remain closed even as the handle approaches that point on the bracket past which the contacts will separate.

Class 75(3) [Also in Group XXXVI] In a holder for powerful incandescent lamps the lamp pins are gripped in blind holes in four part collets 7 owing to wedging action between the tapered external surfaces of the collets and the tapered bores of the insulating blocks 6 which are loosely held in housing 3 to allow limited lateral movement of the collets. The collets, which are connected to supply cables, are urged into the bores in blocks 6 by springs 12 and are lifted out to permit the insertion of the lamp pins into the blind bores by turning handle 11 to lift an actuating plate through cam 10 on shaft 9. For large lamps a neck clamp 18 consisting of a resilient ring split at one point and wrapped in heat resisting material 20, such as asbestos fabric, is provided. The ring is closed to grip the neck of the lamp by pivoted levers 22 operated by a second cam 23 on shaft 9. According to the Provisional Specification the neck clamp may consist of a pair of arcuate members.",MOLE RICHARDSON ENGLAND LTD,BROWN FREDERICK WILLIAM;;KING REGINALD,,https://lens.org/152-378-864-537-38X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H01R33/97,H01R33/97,F4R R326          BG;;F4R R41Y          BG;;F4R R421          BG;;F4R R422          BG;;F4R R433          BG;;H2E ECCX          ECCX;;H2E EDCM          EDCM;;H2E E102          EDCM,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Automatic telephone exchanges. STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES Ltd. 5 May, 1967, No. 20922/67. Heading H4K. A subscriber who wishes future calls to him to be diverted at the exchange to a predetermined other subscriber first dials from his own subset for a common transfer circuit and on receiving second dial tone or a proceed to send signal dials in a digit identifying the other subscriber. The transfer circuit transmits a signal back over the network to the line circuit of the calling subscriber which enables a socalled subscriber's transfer circuit associated with the calling subscriber's line, so that as the common transfer circuit offers the identity of the other subscriber to all subscriber's transfer circuits belonging to lines having the transfer facility the identity is only registered in the calling subscriber's transfer circuit currently being enabled. A particular relay is thereby operated in this transfer circuit, which relay self holds when the enablement signal ceases and which disconnects the subscriber's outlet of the final selector or switching stage and connects it to the line of the other subscriber. A calling subscriber receives transfer tone when the other subscriber's identity is set in the transfer circuit and he then hangs up. To end the transfer arrangement a subscriber sends a cancellation signal to the common transfer circuit which then operates a relay in the subscriber's transfer circuit which releases the operated relay, release being delayed if a transferred call is in progress. The transfer facility is described with reference to a cross-bar exchange and a step-by-step mechanical switching exchange.",STANDARD TELEPHONES CABLES LTD,BRAY FREDERICK HARRY;;BROWN COLIN ROY,,https://lens.org/014-411-958-525-45X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H04Q3/00,H04Q3/00,H4K KFB           KFB;;H4K K1Q1          -;;H4K K1R2          KFB;;H4K K1T8          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Brown, A., Lomax, H., and Lomax, F. Nov. 28. Stoppers; refilling, preventing.-A bottle or like vessel for containing spirits &c. is formed with two seats b, c for the valves d, e, and with a bridge-piece h below the seat c. The valve d has a stem f, which passes through a central aperture in the valve e, and through an aperture in the bridge-piece h. The valve d is secured by two spring-pressed or pivoted arms or spurs, such as i, Fig. 7, which fold up to permit the insertion of the stem f through the bridge-piece, and then open out, as shown. The bridge-piece is closed on its underside, to prevent the entrance of liquid through the central hole, and to protect the liquid from contact with the metal of the valves &c. The valve d is formed with a boss d<x>, Fig. 5, which limits the movement of the valve e, and the valve e has a boss e<x>, Fig. 6, which enters a recess in the bridge h. The valves permit the liquid to be poured out, but prevent refilling. In a modification, the distance between the valves is increased. The bridge h is preferably made integral with the neck of the vessel, but it may consist of a metal or other plug k, Fig. 9, inserted in the neck, and secured in the same manner as the stem f.",BROWN ALBERT;;LOMAX HENRY;;LOMAX FREDERICK,BROWN ALBERT;;LOMAX HENRY;;LOMAX FREDERICK,,https://lens.org/019-915-466-668-527,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Davies, A. E., and Brown, F. M. April 6, 1918. Order apparatus; mine signalling systems. - An electrically-operated signalling device for use in connexion with colliery winding engines comprises a magnet 1 and a solenoid 2 both in the same circuit which is closed by a switch 4 operated by hand or by the pull rope. A pointer 8 is loosely mounted on a fixed axle 11 and is connected to a ratchet wheel 7 provided with a stop 9 and spring controlled so as normally to bring the stop 9 against a stop 10 on the axle 11. A second solenoid 13 has a core 15 which, when the ratchet wheel 7 is moved by a pawl 6 on a lever 5 attracted by the magnet 1, falls in between the stops 9, 10, and prevents the pointer 8 returning to zero till the solenoid 13 is excited by the closing of its circuit by starting of the engine or by hand. The solenoid 2 has a cross-bar 18 on its plunger 17 which is controlled in its fall by a dash-pot 21. A projection 23 on the cross-bar 18 trips a lever 24 when rising and lifts a retaining pawl 26, and by a pin 27 thereon also the actuating pawl 6, clear of the wheel 7, thus allowing the pointer to fall back to the No. 1 indication. The parts are designed so that, on closing the switch 4, the wheel 7 is moved one tooth before the projection 23 rises to lift the pawls 6, 26, and when this occurs immediately afterwards the core 15 has already fallen to prevent return of the wheel 7 and pointer 8 to zero. Subsequent closings of the switch 4 belonging to the same signal will take place before the projection 23 has time to fall below the trip lever 24, and so are recorded. In the event of the signal not being answered, sufficient time will have elapsed before it is considered necessary to repeat the signal for the projection 23 to fall below the lever 24, and on making the first contact of the repetition the pointer will be released to fall back to the No. 1 position and subsequent contacts will be added on as before. Starting of the engine, or otherwise, excites the solenoid 13 and raises the core 15 and with it a hooked &c. rod 28 which lifts the pawls 6, 26, so allowing the pointer to return to zero. The ratchet wheel 7 may be geared to the pointer 8 to increase the movement of the latter. A series of lamps may be used to give the signal, and rotary contacts are described whereby lamps are successively lit, the earlier ones in the series either being extinguished or remaining lit as the signal proceeds.",DAVIES ALBERT EDWARD;;BROWN FREDERICK MATTHEW,DAVIES ALBERT EDWARD;;BROWN FREDERICK MATTHEW,,https://lens.org/144-591-283-700-305,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,B66B19/06,B66B19/06,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The reaction mixture contains 2 to 7 mols. CaO per mol. of P2O5. The aluminium phosphate is converted to calcium phosphate, and the aluminium sulphate formed is reduced to give sulphur and/or sulphur dioxide. The sulphur released may be recovered in elemental form by admitting an inert gas, e.g. nitrogen, or as sulphur dioxide by blowing in air or oxygen. In examples, alumino-phosphate rock (e.g. wavellite from Senegal), coal and calcium sulphate (preferably hemi hydrate) are mixed in proportions of 3.3 mols. CaO and 3 mols. coal per mol. of P2O5, and the mixture ground to 85 mesh. The mixture is then granulated with steam and dried at 60 DEG to 80 DEG C.

Automatic exchange systems. STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES, Ltd. Nov. 16, 1949, No. 29310. [Class 40 (iv)] In a keysender, digits are set up on groups of static electrical switches and transferred automatically one after another as complements to a binary counter comprising pairs of static electrical switches, the digits then being counted out by the counter. Start key KST energizes relay ST to apply anode potential to the cold cathode storage tubes AT1-4, RT1-4, &c. and to the even tubes of a counting chain CRT1-8, a pulse network PN1 firing the even tubes of the counter. Depression of a digit key KO-9 applies positive potential from contact st2 to leads connected by rectifiers to the trigger electrodes of one or a combination of the storage tubes AT1-4, BT1-4, &c. according to a code, the potential being blocked by the rectifiers except in the case of the first set of storage tubes AT1-4, which receives a pulse from the point P1 in response to the operation of a sequential operation distributing circuit (not shown) actuated by depression of the first digit key. The related storage tubes fire, and in like manner the other digits are set up on subsequent groups of storage tubes. When storage is complete, depression of start send key KSS energizes DS to ionize all storage tubes in the group following that used for the last digit, if all groups have not been used. Release of key KSS energizes relay DSR, which restores the sequential operation distributing circuit (not shown) and connects anode potential to the odd tubes of the counter CRT1-8. DSR also releases DS to cause the distributing circuit to apply a positive pulse to point P1 to cause all inert tubes in the first storage group to fire and pass positive pulses to ionize the related odd tubes in the counting chain, which operates on the binary system so that the complement with respect to 16 of the digit is entered. Operation of counting chain. Ionization of an odd tube extinguishes the associated even tube. Transfer of any digit fires either CRT5 or CRT7 to cause pulse network PN2 to fire tube TRT and energize TR, which operates IG when impulse springs A open. IG operates IP, which via pulse network PN1 applies positive pulses to the first pair of tubes in the counter as pulses go out over contacts B, the counter responding in known manner until all even tubes are ionized, when CRT8 fires tube SZT to operate SZ. Relay IG then falls back to stop the impulses at ig2, and by means not shown actuates the sequential operation circuit so that the second digit is transferred and transmitted in similar manner. Release' of IG also applies positive potential over a time delay network to fire tube IDT so extinguishing tube SZT and releasing SZ. After the last digit is transmitted, an attempt to transmit a non-existent digit fails because neither CRT5 not CRT7 is ionized and release of SZ operates CL to light the finish send lamp, start key KST is released and the sender returns to normal. The invention may be applied to registers and may use thermistors, hard tube trigger circuits, cathode-ray tubes or transistons instead of the gas-filled tubes.",STANDARD TELEPHONES CABLES LTD,BRAY FREDERICK HARRY;;BROWN LESLIE RONALD,,https://lens.org/102-923-297-099-949,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H04Q1/50,H04L25/04;;H04Q1/50,G4A A1CX          L;;G4A A1C1A         L;;G4A A1C3          L;;G4A A10A          L;;G4A A10B          L;;G4A A10C          L;;G4A A10EX         L;;G4A A11B          L;;G4D DCD           CD;;H4K KBNA          KBNA;;H4K K1A13         KBNA;;H4K K1A2          KBNA;;H4K K1A3          KBNA;;H4K K1A8          KBNA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Mathie, F. J. B., and Farrow, R. May 12. Vucuum cleaning-apparatus; bellows.-Relates particularly to that class supported by two or more wheels and adapted to be moved backwards and forwards on the carpet or similar surface, the bellows of the apparatus being operated from the wheels. For cleaning upholstery, a hand nozzle is coupled to the suction pipe, the floor nozzle being held out of action. The light supporting - frame a, mounted on the wheels, carries the handle 4 and bail 5. The wheels carry crank - pins 6, Fig. 1, to which are coupled links 7 so that motion is transmitted to a cross-bar working in slots 9. The bellows p are secured to the crossbar and are opened and closed as the cross-bar reciprocates. The forward end carries the dustremoving chamber d, which may have a hemispherical lower end and a removable cover c. The dust chamber contains a removable canvas bag to receive the dust from the suction nozzle g, which may be supported on the arm h pivoted in such a way that the nozzle adapts itself to inequality in the carpet, the flexible hose j also assisting in this movement. To adjust the nozzle laterally, it is made in two parts, pivoted together and adjustable by means of a bolt and nut and slot connexion. To secure the leather of each of the bellows to the corresponding end disk or plate r, the disk is beaded over at its edge to allow the leather q to curl over and to be secured by semicircular hollow clamps s, the ends of the enveloping clamps being secured by bolts which pass through tightening-up lugs. The outlet valve passage u of each bellows is larger in area than the inlet t. The adjacent ends of the bellows are connected by a bolt and boss connexion v. The front air chamber w communicates with the dust chamber d through apertures x which are protected by an inner screen y. The front and rear air chambers are connected by the air passage 2, and each communicates with the inlet air valves t. The bellows are enclosed by the casing 3. Fig. 4 shows a modification in which the disks of the bellows are made of wood, with grooved edges in which the leather is secured by wire rings 19 with couplings 20. The connecting air passage 2 in this case supports the disks through a sliding sleeve 21, a distance-piece 22 preserving the space between the bellows. Motion is communicated to the bellows from the rear wheels b through crankpins 6, links 7, studs 24, bowls 25, and links 26. Front wheels are dispensed with, so that substantially the whole weight of the apparatus tends to keep the nozzle g on the floor. The dust chamber d is arranged horizontally, the cover c being at the front end and secured by clips 13. The cover is formed with the passage 14 preferably elongated to admit of lateral shifting of the nozzle.",MATHIE FREDERICK JAMES BROWN;;FARROW ROBERT,MATHIE FREDERICK JAMES BROWN;;FARROW ROBERT,,https://lens.org/163-104-114-650-843,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,A47L5/04,A47L5/04,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The reflector and lens are positioned so as to direct light from the light source onto an unlit side of the housing. The light fixture is normally suspended from the ceiling or attached to a wall. A greater portion of the light from the light source is reflected off the ceiling or wall, whereas a smaller portion of the light from the light source is reflected off the reflector and onto the housing. After the smaller portion is reflected off the housing, the smaller portion and the larger portion are traveling in generally the same direction, thereby reducing the contrast between the housing and the ceiling or wall. The present fixture housing is very shallow, preferably less than about 3"" deep. It includes one or more side rails, with each side rail being utilized to reflect the light from the light source onto the housing with a first reflector and to alter other diffuse lighting characteristics with a lens, perforated metal, or a second reflector.",PRECISION ARCHITECTURAL LIGHTI,COMPTON FREDERICK A;;BROWN JEFFREY L,PRECISION ARCHITECTRAL LIGHTING (1997-02-26),https://lens.org/066-805-789-342-932,Granted Patent,yes,23,21,1,1,0,F21V13/04;;F21V13/04;;F21S8/033;;F21S8/033;;F21S8/06;;F21S8/06;;F21V5/02;;F21V5/02;;F21V7/0008;;F21V7/0008;;F21V7/0016;;F21V7/0016;;F21V7/0025;;F21V7/0025;;F21V11/14;;F21V11/14;;F21V15/013;;F21V15/013;;F21V23/02;;F21V23/02;;F21W2131/402;;F21W2131/402;;F21Y2103/00;;F21Y2103/00;;F21Y2113/00;;F21Y2113/00,F21S8/00;;F21S8/06;;F21V5/02;;F21V7/00;;F21V11/14;;F21V13/04;;F21V15/01;;F21V23/02,362/300;;362/260;;362/223;;362/299;;362/328;;362/339;;362/291;;362/224;;362/225;;362/18;;362/147,6,0,,,ANSI/IESNA RP 1 1993; Offices with Visual Display Terminals (VDT Schrns) ; (pp. 34 14).;;Peerless; 9 3 Rounded Lightscreen Indirect ; (undated) (4 p.).;;Ledalite; Perfform System Guide ; (undated) (1 p.).;;LiteControl; Classica ; (undated) (3 p.).;;Rolux; Lam Flurescent Indirect ; Series RO 1 94; (8 p.).;;Peerless Lighting Corporation (1986) ; Peerless Lighting/6 Round; Other Softshine Optical Systems ; (3 p.).,EXPIRED

Hydrogen diffusion elements. JOHNSON, MATTHEY & CO. Ltd. March 8, 1963 [April 17, 1962], No. 14810/62. Heading B1L. [Also in Division F2] A hydrogen diffusion element comprises a tube of hydrogen-permeable material in which is located so as to extend along the bore thereof, at least one stiffener whose lateral rigidity is retained under stress of temperature and pressure thus preventing deformation of the tube but permitting passage of hydrogen. The tube may be made of Pd or Pd alloy, e.g. 25% Ag-Pd. The stiffener which may be made of stainless steel or nickel, may be an elongated coil spring, a twisted metal tape, a perforated tube, a plurality of metallic or ceramic rods, a multiplicity of small diameter metal shot or a plurality of intertwined or consecutively arranged wires or tapes. A pervious ceramic rod or tube may also be used as a stiffener and the rod may have a diameter less than the internal diameter of the diffusion tube and be carried by a header mounted in the open end of the diffusion tube. A hydrogen diffusion apparatus, Fig. 2, is constructed out of a number of these diffusion elements 1 closed at one end 2 and containing stiffener springs 3. The tubes are mounted in the base 6 of a cup 5. Gaseous mixtures containing hydrogen enter under pressure at 4d and pass along the tube 4b and into the casing 4. Hydrogen diffuses into the interior of the tubes 1 and passes out through 8. The remaning gas passes out from the apparatus at 4e. In specific embodiments, various temperatures and pressures are exemplified in relation to a stainless steel coil, the highest values being 700 ‹C. and 800 p.s.i.g. respectively.

Gas turbine plant. BRISTOL AEROPLANE CO., Ltd. April 23, 1952 [April 23, 1951], No. 9442/51. Class 110 (3). [Also in Group XXXIV] A gas turbine plant burning liquid fuel has means for circulating liquid fuel in a circuit in heat exchange relation with parts requiring heating and cooling respectively and means for replenishing the fuel in the circuit with fresh fuel from the fuel storage means to make up for normal losses of fuel from the circuit and to prevent the return of fuel to the storage means. Fuel from a tank 5 is supplied by a booster pump 6 to the main engine fuel pump 9 through a filter 7. Fuel is bled from the conduit between the filter 7 and pump 9 and passed through a non-return valve 10, a heat exchanger 13 and a chamber 11 for separating the air and vapour from the fuel to a further pump 17. The fuel is heated in the heat exchanger 13 by the hot lubricating oil from the engine. The valve 10 closes in the flow direction if the flow exceeds a predetermined amount. The flow of hot fuel from the pump 17 is divided into three paths 19, 20 and 21. One path 19 passes through the heating jacket of the filter before joining the inlet of the heat exchanger 13 at 23. The other two paths 20, 21 pass to two annular distributing chambers 24, 25 disposed around the air intake to the compressor 27. From the chamber 25, the fuel flows through the guide blades 28 to another annular chamber 29 and from thence into the jacket space 30 of a doublewalled intake bullet fairing 31. The fuel flows from the chamber 24 through spaces 32 of the leading edge fairings 33 of the intake spider to the space 30. The combined flow from the space 30 passes through the space 35 of a hollow intake spider arm and the conduit 36 to the point 23. To control the rate of heat transfer throttle valves 37, 38 are provided, these valves may be controlled by manual, thermostatic or ice-detecting means. When thermostatic control is provided, the thermostat may be placed in the heating or cooling part of the engine, depending on which is the more critical. Additional heat exchangers 39, 40 may be employed. These heat exchangers may use hot gas as a heating medium or may bring the fuel into contact with the hot external or internal parts of the engine. In this case, the heat exchanger 13 may be omitted. There is a possibility of the fuel being overheated where additional heat exchangers are used. In this case, some of the hot fuel may be returned to the fuel system through a conduit 41, a throttle valve 42 and a venturi 43 and the valve 10 over-ridden so that it may pass more fuel. The matrix of the heat exchanger 13, the pump 17 and driving motor 18 may be assembled to form a unit which may be mounted on the wall of the lubricating oil storage tank above the oil level. The motor 18 may be a turbine driven by air bled from the compressor. The invention may be applied to a plant with several engines.",BRISTOL AEROPLANE CO LTD,PITTS GEORGE FREDERICK;;BROWN ARTHUR HARRY OLIVER,,https://lens.org/156-511-258-071-693,Granted Patent,no,0,9,1,1,0,B64D33/08;;B64D37/02;;F02C7/047,B64D33/08;;B64D37/02;;F02C7/047,F1G G10C          G10C;;F1G G11           G11;;F1G G14           G14;;F1G G6            G6;;F2A ALD           ALD;;F2A AL912         ALD,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

March 12, 1959 [April 3, 1958], No. 10934/58. Class 46. [Also in Group XXVI] A liquid fuel supply system for a gas turbine comprising a fuel filter and downstream of it a unit, e.g. a fuel supply control unit, in which ice formation is liable to cause malfunctioning, has means arranged on sensing of ice formation in the filter, to heat the unit prior to the heating of the filter for de-icing purposes whereby water formed by melting of ice in the filter flows through the unit without freezing therein. Fuel from a tank 16 is delivered by a booster pump 17 into a fuel pipe 18 containing a fuel heater 19 heated by air tapped from the engine compressor 10 by a conduit 20. The air flow is controlled by a valve 21 operated by a solenoid 21a. The fuel leaving the heater 19 normally passes through a valve 29, a main filter 24 high pressure fuel pump 22, control mechanism 25 and shut off cock 26 to the engine. The system also comprises an auxiliary fuel filter 27. When ice clogs the filter 24, the pressure drop across it increases and causes the collapse of the bellows 34 so that switch 35 is closed. This energises the solenoid 21a which opens valve 21 and allows hot air to be supplied to the heater 19. At the same time the motor 31 is operated to rotate cam 30. This allows spring 29b to urge valve member 29a to the left so that fuel is supplied to the control unit 25 through the auxiliary filter 27. After a period of ninety seconds the cam 30 starts to move the valve member 29a to the right so that for about fifteen seconds both filters are fed with heated fuel. Thereafter, fuel is fed to the filter 24 only. During the periods when hot fuel is fed to the filter 24, the ice in the filter is melted and due to the previous heating of the control unit, the resulting water flows through the control mechanism without freezing. The motor 31 also rotates a cam 30a which closes a holding switch 35a for one revolution of the motor. In a modification, Figs. 2 and 3 (not shown), the control unit and filter have control valves and connecting ducting arranged so that in one setting of the valves the heater is arranged between the filter and the control unit and in the second setting, the filter is arranged between the heater and the control unit.",ROLLS ROYCE,MORLEY FREDERICK WILLIAM WALTO;;BROWN DAVID MORRIS,,https://lens.org/040-642-452-529-665,Granted Patent,no,0,9,1,1,0,B01D35/12;;F02C7/224,B01D35/12;;F02C7/224,B1D DNA           B1DNA;;B1D DNRE          DNRE;;F1G G10B          G10E2Z;;F1G G10C          G10E2Z,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Pressure-relieving devices for fluids. JOHNSON, MATTHEY & CO., Ltd. Aug. 9, 1955 [Aug. 30, 1954], No. 25156/54. Class 135. A vacuum support for a domed disc 3 which is adapted to burst on the attainment of a predetermined pressure on the concave side thereof consists of a domed member 2 shaped to fit exactly the member 3 and provided with apertures 5 to allow access of the pressure to the member 3, the member 2 having radial slits 7 so that if, after bursting of the disc 3, the holes 5 present such a resistance to flow as to prevent adequate release of pressure the member 2 opens up to allow unrestricted flow. The member 2 is formed initially with a slightly more domed contour than is required in the finished member so that after the formation of the holes 5 and the radial slits 7 the member can be pressed downwardly to the required shape in which process the edges of the radial slits are pressed into tight engagement with each other. This process is facilitated by the truncating of the apex of each of the sectors 6 formed by the radial slits. A thin piece of foil, e.g. silver, 12, soldered in position, retains the sectors in mutual alignment and ruptures to allow the member 2 to open. An arcuate slit 7a is associated with each radial slit to facilitate bending of the sectors 6.

The reel 3 has a square aperture (Fig. 3, not shown) whereby it is mounted on the square section end portion 9 of a fitting 13, this fitting being keyed to, and slidable in, the hollow end of a shaft 8 driven by a sprocket 22 through a one-way clutch 23. The fitting 13 is connected to a spring-biased spindle 12 having an end 26 engageable by a tool (not shown) whereby pulling on the end 26 causes the end portion 9 to be withdrawn from the reel aperture and the reel to drop through a discharge port 39 after removal of a sliding bolt 40. A drum 75 has wound thereon a compressed gas hose 85a supporting a thermocouple cable cutting device 85 as disclosed in Specification 953,233, this device being received in a vertical passage 52 in the body 1. The passage 52 has a lamp 59 and an observation port (Fig 2, not shown) and is connected to the chamber 2 by a passageway 57. The drum 75 is driven by a handle 76 and rotates the sprocket 22 through a chain 80 and a chain-wheel mounted on the drum axis, the drive to the sprocket including a friction clutch. In use the winch is clamped on a shield box 83 located over a reactor charge tube 84 and the end of a selected thermocouple cable 86 from a fuel element is threaded through the device 85 and the passageway 57 and coiled on the reel 3. The device 85 is lowered by the drum 75 to cut the cable 86 adjacent the fuel element, the clutch 23 preventing rotation of the reel 3. The device 85 is now raised and simultaneously the cable 86 is wound on the reel, the arrangement being such that the cable 86 is wound in faster than the hose 85a so that the cable is wound tightly on the reel, the friction clutch preventing overstressing the cable.

Packing slow combustion fuzes and detonators. IMPERIAL CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES. Ltd. Oct. 17, 1951 [Dec. 22, 1950], No. 31265/50. Class 9(i) [Also in Group IX] Apparatus for packaging safety fuze cord in contiguous flat coils to form a hollow cylinder between end discs with a wrapping of flexible sheet material around the curved surface is shown in Fig. 1. The fuze cords 13 are fed along a tray 2 resting on the inclined surface of a block 1 and pass between upstanding tapered teeth 4 of a comb fitting into a groove in the tray. The sides of the tray converge towards a flexible belt 5 attached to the forward end. On this belt lies a strip 3 of paper or fibre-board. The belt 5 passes over the roller of a tensioning device 6 such as a compression spring or a weight after passing beneath a mandrel consisting of a hollow metal drum 10 having a flange at one end against which rests an annulus: 11. In this annulus is a slot 12 aligned with a recess 14 in the reeling drum. Each fuze cord is attached to a detonator 15 which is placed in the recess-14. A spring clip 8 holds the wrapping strip 3 in position and dowel pins 16 secure the annulus to the flange of the drum. A pair of guide rollers is bolted to the tray and the belt, which is also attached to the block 1. The forward end of the tray is of tapered thickness so that the upper surface of the belt is aligned with the main surface of the tray. The clip 8 is operated by means of a pressure bar 9. As the drum revolves the fuze cords 13 are coiled around it, Fig. 4, a removable recessed disc 17 holding the coils in position. The end disc 17 is slotted similarly to the annulus 11 to facilitate insertion of the detonators into the recess in the drum and is secured to the drum by dowel pins. The drum, which is supported by a bearing 19, is connected to a driving belt 20. On completion of the winding the wrapping 3 is secured by a strip 21 of adhesive material, the package is removed from the drum and end cover discs 22 are attached by strips 23 of adhesive material, Fig. 6.",ICI LTD,BROWN HAROLD FREDERICK;;PHILLIPS HECTOR MACDONALD MARS,,https://lens.org/178-822-380-006-859,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,B65D85/02,B65D85/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Creed, F. G., Coulsen, W. A., Brown, H. T., and Brown, N. P. Dec. 12. Typewriters; type, setting.-Relates to apparatus of the kind described in Specification No. 22,653, A.D. 1902, for operating typewriting or type-setting mechanism by means of perforated tape. The holes in the tape effect the re-arrangement of a number of sliding combs, each such arrangement permitting a bar to enter the recesses in the combs and connect a key-lever of the machine with an actuating-lever. The tape is guided between two vertical plates a, b, each having ten pairs of holes which coincide with the holes d' in the tape d, Fig. 9. The plates a, b are carried by a frame i, which is reciprocated horizontally by a cam k on the driving-shaft m. A perforated plate p, Fig. 7, secured to one of the plates a, b by a spring, enables the tape-guide to be cleared of any matter that accumulates therein. The feed-holes d<3>in the tape are engaged by a pinwheel r having on its shaft a pinion which can be engaged by a feed-rack sliding in a fixed vertical guide v, Fig. 8. A shutter 17 is held by a spring- actuated lever against the lower end of the feedrack. Opposite to the tape-guide a, b are plates 25 in which slide ten pairs of selector pins 27, each of which actuates one of a number of selector plates 21, pivoted on a vertical rod 22 and held in normal position by springs 24. To each pair of selector plates corresponds a stop plate 20, adapted to be moved by a spring 29 into the guide v in order to arrest the descent of the feed-rack. The horizontally-sliding combs 36 of the typewritercontrolling, mechanism are urged to the right by springs 38, and are controlled by a lever 40 and a cam on thedriving-shaft. The tape is passed up between the plates a, b until the first hole or holes d' comes opposite the top pair of holes in the plates a, b. Then, upon the machine starting, the tapeguide is moved by the cam k towards the pins 27. The pins which are opposite to holes in the tape remain at rest, but pins opposite to blank parts of the tape are moved to the left and displace corresponding selector plates 21. The combs 36, being released by the lever 40, move to the right against a stop, those combs which are opposite to displaced plates 21 being thereby prevented from moving. The blank part d<2> of the tape at the end of each letter causes both plates 21 of the corresponding pair to be displaced and a stop plate 20 to move into the guide v. The plates 21 are retained in their displaced positions by a hooked lever 47 actuated by a cam 49. The forward motion of the tape-guide moves the feed-rack out of gear with its pinion, and the rack is then caused to descend until it meets the displaced stop plate 20. The shutter 17 is thereby moved into. position to arrest all the combs 36 which are below the stop plate 20. The tape-guide is moved back by the cam k, and the feed-rack re-engages the pinion. The rack is then raised by a cam, and the tape is fed upwards to bring the next letter into position. After printing, the combs 36 are retracted by the lever 40 and the stop plate 20 by a rod actuated by a cam. When a blank space in the tape follows the last letter of a word, all the combs move forward until arrested by the shutter 17, except the first pair, which are prevented from moving by displaced selector plates, and a spacing movement of the typewriter is thereby effected. The typewriter-controlling mechanism comprises vertical bars 53, pivoted on a rod 54 and pressed by springs 58 against the combs 36. The bars 53 move hooked rods 63, pivoted to the key-levers 62 of the typewriter, beneath a lever 64 which is actuated by a cam or eccentric on the driving-shaft m. The driving-shaft is provided with a clutch mechanism consisting of a driving-cone 74 on a loose wheel 76, Fig. 6, and a driven cone 75 which can be moved along the shaft by means of a screwed sleeve 78 and spring 79. The clutch is controlled by a pivoted stop 83 actuated by a hand-lever 86. The clutch is automatically disengaged after a certain number of words have been written in a line by means of a cam 96, Fig. 3, which is rotated step by step from the lever 64. A bar 104 is pivoted on a shaft 105, carried by a lever frame 106 which is connected to the clutch stop 83. The bar 104 is vibrated by the bar 53 which actuates the typewriter space-bar. When a notch 103 in the cam 96 comes opposite a shoulder on the bar 104, the latter moves under a vibrating bar 110, the lever frame 106 is depressed, and the clutch is disengaged. The clutch may be similarly operated by a second cam after the line has reached a given length independently of the typewriter space-bar.

B., Hill, F. J., and Herbert, W. Nov. 10. Cutting - up, splitting, and slicing.-Figs. 1, 2, and 3 show a machine for splitting firewood and the like. The driving- shaft has a crank by which the blocks F are reciprocated in guides E, E. These blocks are flanged at G, and bolted together, and are preferably made in one with the knife-holders K, M. The holder K carries two splitting - knives L, L , placed at right-angles to one another, and the holder M carries a single knife N for splitting blocks which are too wide to enter the feedtrough P. The knives L pass through slots in the plate U, which is adjustable vertically by means of a screw W, to suit the depth of the blocks to be cut. The plate is carried by a slide V, which moves between guides on the framing. The blocks are placed in the trough by hand, and are fed by toothed rollers s, s' rotated intermittently by the means shown in Fig. 2. On the spindles of the rollers are grooved wheels a, a<1>, with which gear pawls c, c', carried by the levers b, b<1>. The levers b, b<1> are connected by a link, and are rocked by an adjustable pin in the crank-disc n. A pawl e prevents the backward movement of the rollers. The top roller is pressed downwards by a spring. When the block is being split it rests at one side against a metal-faced block of india-rubber; let into a recess in one side of the trough P. In one modification, the feed-rollers are driven by wormgear from a spindle, which is rotated by a friction pawl, as described above. In another the feeding is effected by serrated plates, reciprocating in slots in the plate U, and the bottom of the trough.",CLERK ARCHIBALD BROWN;;HILL FREDERICK JOHN;;HERBERT WALTER,CLERK ARCHIBALD BROWN;;HILL FREDERICK JOHN;;HERBERT WALTER,,https://lens.org/022-100-658-305-131,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   A face and environment sensing portable device. In a preferred embodiment, the device is wrist-worn by a person, similarly to a wristwatch. The portable device includes one or more sensing elements, such as an image-capturing device, a microphone or other environmental sensor, and a processing system for processing data obtained from the sensing element(s). In addition, the portable device may include input/output elements for interfacing the portable device with a person and with external systems. The portable device reliably authenticates the identity of the person based on information obtained from the sensing element(s) and may also determine whether the user has been in continuous possession of the device. By using multi-modal identification, the invention may provide increased confidence, while maintaining a low cost. This verification may then be used, for example, to enable the person to conduct secure transactions. The verification may also be used to tailor or customize applications and services to the user's personal preferences. The invention avoids drawbacks of conventional authentication techniques, such as inaccuracies in manual photographic identification techniques and the proliferation of excessive numbers of passwords. In another aspect, the invention overcomes drawbacks in the abilities of low-cost image sensors by applying superresolution techniques to combine multiple lower quality images into an image with improved quality. Super-resolution processing can be performed in the portable device itself or by an external infrastructure.

In a preferred embodiment, the device is wrist-worn by a person, similarly to a wristwatch. The portable device includes one or more sensing elements, such as an image-capturing device, a microphone or other environmental sensor, and a processing system for processing data obtained from the sensing element(s). In addition, the portable device may include input/output elements for interfacing the portable device with a person and with external systems. The portable device reliably authenticates the identity of the person based on information obtained from the sensing element(s) and may also determine whether the user has been in continuous possession of the device. By using multi-modal identification, the invention may provide increased confidence, while maintaining a low cost. This verification may then be used, for example, to enable the person to conduct secure transactions. The verification may also be used to tailor or customize applications and services to the user's personal preferences. The invention avoids drawbacks of conventional authentication techniques, such as inaccuracies in manual photographic identification techniques and the proliferation of excessive numbers of passwords. In another aspect, the invention overcomes drawbacks in the abilities of low-cost image sensors by applying superresolution techniques to combine multiple lower quality images into an image with improved quality.

A vibrating spreader feeder comprises a relatively long narrow tapered tray 1 which has a discharge edge 8 cut on a bias and a series of longitudinal vertical guides 9 arranged parallel to the direction of reciprocatory motion to cause the material to be discharged in a substantially uniform curtain. The upper edges of the guides are inclined downwards towards the edge 8. The guides may be replaced by a substantially vertical weir-plate mounted along the edge 8. This plate tapers downwardly from the feed end of the tray and has means for adjusting the height and slope of its top edge. It may also consist of a series of thin plates 24, Fig. 5, adjustably clamped together by a bar 23 so that their upper edges approximate to a shallow arc. The tray is supported by pivoted arms 2 and is reciprocated by a rotary cam 4 which engages a follower 6 on the rear end of the tray. A counterbalanced shoot 12 is mounted pivotally in upward extensions 10 of the tray and is disposed below a fixed hopper 17 in such a way that materials can escape only through the gap 18 between its mouth and the surface of the shoot. The shoot is counterbalanced by an adjustable spring 15 in conjunction with a dashpot 16.

The control valve subsystem includes a feed water shut-off valve (10) and a regulating valve (30). The shut-off valve (10) has a control chamber (20) subjected to product water pressure to control its open-closed condition, and is effective to close it at a predetermined upper limit of product water pressure. The regulating valve (30) includes two diaphragm areas (A1, A2) on a single moving element, two diaphragm operated valves (37, 38) (only one of which can be open at one time), and a relief valve (46). The regulating valve (30) is responsive to a demand for bladder control water to the reservoir (90) on diaphragm area (A1) to establish a first and higher level of control water flowing to the reservoir (90), and is also responsive to an excess of bladder control water flowing from the reservoir acting on diaphragm areas (A1) and (A2) to establish a second and lower level of control water back pressure in the reservoir (90). The regulating valve (30) thus automatically senses whether the system is requiring control water to be fed into the control water chamber (96) to raise its pressure level; or is requiring control water to be relieved from the control water chamber (96) to reduce its pressure level. The higher pressure of control water is desired as the motive pressure for delivery of product water at the faucet or ice maker (100); the -0b-lower back pressure of control water, during production and filling, enhances flow through the filtration unit (50).",EASTMAN KODAK CO,BROWN BARRY M;;EDWARDS EVAN A;;TONE FREDERICK,,https://lens.org/117-175-121-187-631,Granted Patent,no,0,0,11,11,0,B01D61/08;;B01D61/12;;B01D61/08;;B01D61/12,C02F1/44;;B01D61/00;;B01D61/06;;B01D61/08;;B01D61/12,D41820019    M,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In a preferred embodiment, the device is wrist-worn by a person, similarly to a wristwatch. The portable device includes one or more sensing elements, such as an image-capturing device, a microphone or other environmental sensor, and a processing system for processing data obtained from the sensing element(s). In addition, the portable device may include input/output elements for interfacing the portable device with a person and with external systems. The portable device reliably authenticates the identity of the person based on information obtained from the sensing element(s) and may also determine whether the user has been in continuous possession of the device. By using multi-modal identification, the invention may provide increased confidence, while maintaining a low cost. This verification may then be used, for example, to enable the person to conduct secure transactions. The verification may also be used to tailor or customize applications and services to the user's personal preferences. The invention avoids drawbacks of conventional authentication techniques, such as inaccuracies in manual photographic identification techniques and the proliferation of excessive numbers of passwords. In another aspect, the invention overcomes drawbacks in the abilities of low-cost image sensors by applying superresolution techniques to combine multiple lower quality images into an image with improved quality. Super-resolution processing can be performed in the portable device itself or by an external infrastructure.",HEWLETT PACKARD CO,KITSON FREDERICK L;;BROWN JASON;;APOSTOLOPOULOS JOHN G,,https://lens.org/149-227-163-763-417,Patent Application,yes,0,0,4,4,0,G06F21/32;;G07C9/257;;G06F18/00;;G06F21/32;;G07C9/257;;G06F18/00,G06F21/00;;G06K9/00;;G07C9/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

As position information is required, the measurement processor captures the actual position signal from each machine axis sensor and uses this position signal to locate (112) a set of the axis correction data which describes the machine characteristics at that position. The measurement processor then mathematically combines (114) (FIGURE 9) the position signal with the subset of axis correction data to obtain a corrected position signal having a corrected set of coordinate values which describe the probe position in a true Cartesian coordinate system.

Instructed by an application server, the VoIP switch will set up call legs (e.g., via the PSTN) to one or more of the subscribers' telephone numbers. Optionally, when one of the call legs is answered, the application server will instruct the VoIP switch to disconnect the other call legs.",QWEST COMM INT INC,VERBIL JOHN;;CERAMI RICHARD;;BROWN TAMMY S;;FREDERICK JOEL,QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC (2011-11-02),https://lens.org/098-486-003-026-686,Patent Application,yes,3,8,14,14,0,H04M1/2535;;H04M1/658;;H04L65/1063;;H04L65/1096;;H04M7/006;;H04L65/102;;H04L65/1045;;H04M1/2535;;H04M1/658;;H04L65/1063;;H04L65/1096;;H04L65/102;;H04L65/1045;;H04L65/1104;;H04M7/006;;H04L65/1069;;H04M3/53366,H04M7/00,370/352,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The end-point detector is preferably a pH meter but may instead be based on change of colour, conductivity or redox potential. The pipettes A, C, are shown as one being of the overflow type and the other having an electrical level detector but these two types are interchangeable. The device b is preferably a photo-cell and lamp for detecting the liquid meniscus, but other kinds of electrical and mechanical level-gauges are mentioned as suitable. Stirring of the titration vessel may be effected by a mechanical stirrer or by blowing an inert gas through the liquid. The sample can be introduced manually or automatically and the apparatus can be arranged to cut off after the end-point is reached or to re-set itself to receive another sample. The sequence of operations is as follows (referring to Fig. 1):-(1) all valves are shut except 1, vessel V is full from the previous titration, and the sample is flowing through A; (2) valve 1 closes, b moves towards its rest position (continuing through subsequent operations (3) to (6) if necessary), valve 2 opens and vessel empties; (3) valve 2 shuts and 3 opens, filling C with diluent; (4) valve 3 shuts and 4 opens, passing diluent into V; (5) valve 4 shuts and 5 opens, delivering sample into V; (6) valve 5 shuts and 6 opens to fill burette; (7) valve 6 shuts and 7 opens, and titration commences; when about 90% of the correct amount has been delivered the circuit mentioned above comes into play and interrupts the flow from the burette for increasingly long intervals (up to 30 sec. in the end); (8) valve 7 has now closed and the device b records the level in the burette. The device b which detects the level of liquid in the burette is driven by a motor which also operates an indicator or recorder to show the amount of titrant added.",ICI LTD,BROWN JOHN FREDERICK;;WEIR ROBERT JAMES;;WHELAN ANTHONY ROBERT,,https://lens.org/009-964-471-217-294,Granted Patent,no,0,1,2,2,0,G01N31/16;;G01N31/16,G01N31/16,F2V VS20          VS20;;G1A APG           PG1B;;G1A AR7           4;;G1A A20Y          4;;G1A A204          4;;G1A A247          4;;G1A A248          4;;G1A A26Y          4;;G1A A261          4;;G1A A263          4;;G1A A266          4;;G1A A269          4;;G1A A307          4;;G1A A357          4;;G1A A358          4;;G1A A36Y          4;;G1A A361          4;;G1A A363          4;;G1A A366          4;;G1A A369          4;;G1A A402          4;;G1A A404          4;;G1A A406          4;;G1A A42X          4;;G1A A42Y          4;;G1A A43X          4;;G1A A43Y          4;;G1A A447          4;;G1A A448          4;;G1A A449          4;;G1A A457          4;;G1A A458          4;;G1A A459          4;;G1A A46Y          4;;G1A A461          4;;G1A A463          4;;G1A A465          4;;G1A A469          4;;G1A A478          4;;G1A A479          4;;G1A A480          4;;G1A A489          4;;G1A A492          4;;G1A A493          4;;G1A A495          4;;G1A A502          4;;G1A A510          4;;G1A A516          4;;G1A A620          4;;G1A A675          4;;G1N NADW          ADW;;G1N NBHC          BHC;;G1N N1A1          AZ;;G1N N1A3A         AZ;;G1N N1A3B         AZ;;G1N N1A3C1        AZ;;G1N N1D8          AZ;;G1N N19B2B        BHC;;G1N N19B2Q        BHC;;G1N N19F3         BHC;;G1N N25B          BHC;;G1N N25B3B        BHC;;G1N N25DX         BHC;;G1N N25D10        BHC;;G1N N25E1         BHC;;G1N N3V2          AZ;;G1N N3V7          AZ;;G1N N4A           AZ;;G1N N4C           AZ;;G1N N7F           AZ;;G1N N7G           AZ;;H1N NJC           NJC;;H1N N48X          HF;;H1N N637          HF;;H1N N637          NJC;;H1N N652          HF;;H1N N652          NJC,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Electro-chemical deburring of metal workpieces. ASSOCIATED ENG. Ltd. Dec.10, 1965 [Dec. 14, 1964], No.50852/64. Heading C7B. In a method of deburring metal workpieces by electro-chemical machining in which a deburring tool is arranged in close proximity to the region or regions to be deburred such that the tool and workpiece are maintained in fixed positions during the deburring operation, the tool and the workpiece being connected into an electrical circuit such that the workpiece forms an anode and the tool forms a cathode, electrolyte being present therebetween, the tool employed is shaped so as to conform to the shape of the region or. regions to be deburred. The tool may be formed using as pattern a workpiece which has been deburred, either by casting metal about the workpiece and removing therefrom said casting which thus conforms to the workpiece, or by means of a reverse electrochemical machining process in which the workpiece forms the cathode and a tool blank forms the anode. The tool may be partially coated with insulating material to restrict electrolytic action to the required regions, Fig. 3 (not shown). In the apparatus shown for carrying out the method of the invention a gear-wheel 18 which forms the workpiece to be deburred is mounted on a base 19 and within an enclosure 23, the deburring tool 21 being mounted above said workpiece, and electrolyte is supplied to the enclosure via pipe 25 to pass through the gap 22 between the tool 21 and workpiece 18 to discharge via outlet 27. A desired pressure may be maintained within the enclosure by means of pressure valve 28. After the deburring operation has taken place compressed air may be admitted to the enclosure via inlet 30 to blow out electrolyte from the enclosure and partially dry the workpiece.",ASS ENG LTD,BROWN DENNIS COCKBURN;;DICKSON ERIC WINSTON;;GROGAN ANTHONY FREDERICK,,https://lens.org/034-004-247-474-18X,Granted Patent,no,0,3,4,4,0,B23H9/02,B23H9/02,B3V VEEX          VEEX;;B3V V102          VEEX;;C7B BA1G2         -;;C7B BA2A2         -;;C7B BA2A5         -;;C7B BA2B1         -;;C7B BA2C2         -;;C7B BA2C4X        -;;C7B BBA           BA;;C7B B151          BA;;C7B B690          BA;;C7C CA584;;C7C CA587;;C7C CA588;;C7C CA653;;C7C CA654;;C7C CB182;;C7C CB196;;C7C CB197;;C7C CB24X;;C7C CB240;;C7C CB359;;C7C CB366;;C7C CB369;;C7C CB378;;C7C CB409;;C7C CB414;;C7C CB415;;C7C CB416;;C7C CB458;;C7C CB459;;C7C CB46X;;C7C CB461;;C7C CB464;;C7C CB50X;;C7C CB500;;C7C CB502;;C7C CB509;;C7C CB512;;C7C CB519;;C7C CB522;;C7C CB524;;C7C CC69X;;C7C CC695;;C7C CC711;;C7C CC712;;C7C CC713;;C7C CC718;;C7C CC724;;C7C CC738;;C7C CC74X;;C7C CC74Y;;C7C CC744;;C7C CC750;;C7C CC754;;C7C CC77Y;;C7C CC773;;C7C CC774;;C7C CC776;;C7C CC779;;C7C CC78X;;C7C CC783;;C7C CC797,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The polyalkenoxy agent and corrosion inhibiting salt may be applied to the textile materials from the same solution or dispersion or from separate solutions or dispersions in separate stages. In the manufacture of cold-drawable fibres when the filaments from which the fibres are made are drawn to at least twice their length, the polyalkenoxy agent may be applied in an aqueous bath on a draw frame before drawing the filaments at least twice their length, the corrosion inhibiting salt being applied subsequently or after drawing but before cutting into staple length fibres.

BLOCK & ANDERSON, Ltd., and HALL TELEPHONE ACCESSORIES, Ltd. March 24, 1953 [March 31, 1952], No. 8159/52. Class 100 (1). Pile tables; ; sheet-separators.- In a sheet-separating apparatus the pile table for the sheets is pivotally mounted at or near the end remote from that from which the sheets are delivered, and is urged upwardly at the free end by spring means controlled by an escapement which is itself controlled by a detector engaging the .top sheet of the pile, whereby the top of the pile is kept at a desired level. As applied to a duplicating-machine, the pile table 5 is pivoted about a fixed axis 3, and is urged upwardly at the back or delivery end by a roller 15 carried on one end 14 of a bell-crank lever secured to a shaft 16, the other end 17 of the lever being attached to a tension spring 18. A pile of sheets is placed on the table 5 between adjustable side plates 6 and the table depressed against the action of the spring 18 to bring the top of the pile to the level of a plate 10 which is secured to the machine frame. The shaft 16 is coupled to a shaft 28 through a number of gear-wheels and a one-way clutch, so that as the table 5 is moved, an escapement wheel 29 on the shaft 28 is rotated: the clutch allows free depression of the table 5. The rotation of the wheel 29 is controlled by a rocker 30 to which is attached a pendulum arm 31 carrying a weight 32. When the pendulum 31, 32 is free to swing, its natural frequency determines the rate of movement of the escapement wheel 29. The upward movement of the table 5 is arrested, when the top of the sheet pile is at the correct level, by the free end of a lever 34 embracing a pin 33 secured to the rocker 30. The lever 34 is pivoted at 35 and attached to a link 36 which is guided for vertical movement by a detector responsive to the position of the top sheet of the pile. As shown, this detector comprises a friction or combing roller 11 which feeds the sheets from the pile, the roller being carried by an arm 12 pivoted at 13 and driven by known means. An arm 40 secured to the arm 12 is adapted to engage a pin 39 on the link 36 so that if the roller 11 drops below a certain level the link is lifted to release the rocker 30 and allow the spring 18 to raise the table 5. A latch 41 on the arm 40 can engage in a notch 43 in a plate 42 to enable the roller 11 to be retained in a raised position during loading of the table 5. The lower part 10<SP>1</SP> of the fixed plate 10 slopes away from the table 5 and acts to register the sheet pile by displacing it rearwardly as the table rises. An adjustable trip, to prevent upward movement of the table just before the pile of sheets is exhausted and to operate an electric trip in the drive of the machine if the machine is driven electrically, comprises an arm secured to the shaft 16 adapted to operate a link which stops the rotation of the roller 11 and the machine when the arm has been rotated through a predetermined arc by the shaft 16.",BLOCK & ANDERSON LTD;;HALL TELEPHONE ACCESSORIES LTD,WATTON LEONARD HERBERT NEVILLE;;BROWN ROLAND;;HALL FREDERICK WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/093-022-598-606-913,Granted Patent,no,0,3,1,1,0,B65H1/18,B65H1/18,B8R RAD1          RAD1;;B8R R10A1B        RAD1;;B8R R10A1C        RAD1;;B8R R10A2         RAD1;;B8R R10C3B        RAD1,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
