    A method and apparatus for enhancing reliability of a high voltage input/output (I/O) driver/receiver reduces voltage stress on transistors forming part of a logic I/O driver/receiver. The driver/receiver is designed to handle voltages greater than the power supply rails and a bias circuit reduces the voltage stress present on the output stage when a power supply voltage is removed from the circuit. The bias circuit is driven by I/O pin voltage to control a transistor within the I/O logic ladder.

High EGFR expression and phosphorylated EGFR predicts poor survival in head and neck cancer patients, but does not correlate with advanced stage disease. In our studies, we determined that clinical biological correlates are likely to be more accurate when different aspects of EGFR are evaluated in combination. We analyzed EGFR phosphorylation, expression and mutations in 60 primary head and neck tumors.

High EGFR expression and phosphorylated EGFR predicts poor survival in head and neck cancer patients, but does not correlate with advanced stage disease. In our studies, we determined that clinical biological correlates are likely to be more accurate when different aspects of EGFR are evaluated in combination. We analyzed EGFR phosphorylation, expression and mutations in 60 primary head and neck tumors. We not only found that head and neck tumors with either truncated or activated EGFR tend to have higher tumor and nodal stage, but also discovered three EGFR truncations.",CHAN EDWARD L;;KELLER JAMES,CHAN EDWARD L;;KELLER JAMES,THE RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK (2010-10-28);;RESEARCH FOUNDATION FOR THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK THE (2012-06-19),https://lens.org/078-569-490-644-358,Patent Application,yes,1,1,4,4,20,C07K14/71;;C07K2319/00;;C07K2319/23;;C07K2319/42;;C07K2319/43;;C07K2319/60;;G01N33/57407;;G01N2333/71;;G01N2800/56;;C07K14/71;;C07K2319/00;;C07K2319/23;;C07K2319/42;;C07K2319/43;;C07K2319/60;;G01N33/57407;;G01N2333/71;;G01N2800/56;;C07K16/40;;C12N9/12;;C12Q1/6886;;G01N33/74,C07K16/40;;C12Q1/68;;C12N9/12;;G01N33/74,435/6.11;;435/7.23;;435/194;;536/23.2;;435/320.1;;530/387.9;;435/252.33;;435/6.12,1,1,004-789-423-578-565,16951222;;10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-06-0913,Sok et al.

High EGFR expression and phosphorylated EGFR predicts poor survival in head and neck cancer patients, but does not correlate with advanced stage disease. In our studies, we determined that clinical biological correlates are likely to be more accurate when different aspects of EGFR are evaluated in combination. We analyzed EGFR phosphorylation, expression and mutations in 60 primary head and neck tumors. We not only found that head and neck tumors with either truncated or activated EGFR tend to have higher tumor and nodal stage, but also discovered three EGFR truncations.",CHAN EDWARD L;;KELLER JAMES;;UNIV NEW YORK STATE RES FOUND,CHAN EDWARD L;;KELLER JAMES,THE RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK (2010-10-28);;RESEARCH FOUNDATION FOR THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK THE (2012-06-19),https://lens.org/198-028-649-635-699,Granted Patent,yes,1,3,4,4,20,C07K14/71;;C07K2319/00;;C07K2319/23;;C07K2319/42;;C07K2319/43;;C07K2319/60;;G01N33/57407;;G01N2333/71;;G01N2800/56;;C07K14/71;;C07K2319/00;;C07K2319/23;;C07K2319/42;;C07K2319/43;;C07K2319/60;;G01N33/57407;;G01N2333/71;;G01N2800/56;;C07K16/40;;C12N9/12;;C12Q1/6886;;G01N33/74,C07K16/00;;C07K14/71;;C07K16/40;;C12N9/12;;C12Q1/68;;G01N33/574;;G01N33/74,530/388.22;;530/387.1;;530/387.9,1,1,004-789-423-578-565,16951222;;10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-06-0913,Sok et al.

A second fold is imparted to the towel substantially to the first fold thereby creating a lead flap and a trailing flap. The lead flap begins with the first fold and thereby creates a tab end which is two-ply and which will not delaminate on dispensing. The user will thus always be grasping a two-ply product as it is being dispensed thereby minimizing tear-out and tab-out failure.

At least two of the tridentate members are relatively small molecules, usually less than about 7,000 Daltons in size. The particular appropriate spacer moiety selected for a tridentate imparts certain steric properties to the tridentate conjugate. In one embodiment, the binding of a macromolecular specific binding partner to one of the tridentate members sterically inhibits the binding of a different macromolecule to another tridentate member. In another embodiment, the binding of a first tridentate member to a macromolecule restricts the subsequent binding of a second tridentate member to a proximate location on the same macromolecule.

    This invention relates to substituted benzanilides which are ligands, agonists or antagonists, of the CCR5 receptor. In addition, this invention relates to the treatment and prevention of disease states mediated by CCR5, including, but not limited to, asthma and atopic disorders (for example, atopic dermatitis and allergies), rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis and other fibrotic diseases, atherosclerosis, psoriasis, autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease, all in mammals, by the use of substituted benzanilides which are CCR5 receptor antagonists. Furthermore, since CD8 T cells have been implicated in COPD, CCR5 may play a role in their recruitment and therefore antagonists to CCR5 could provide potential therapeutic in the treatment of COPD. Also, since CCR5 is a co-receptor for the entry of HIV into cells, selective receptor ligands may be useful in the treatment of HIV infection.

In addition, this invention relates to the treatment and prevention of disease states mediated by CCR5, including, but not limited to, asthma and atopic disorders (for example, atopic dermatitis and allergies), rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis and other fibrotic diseases, atherosclerosis, psoriasis, autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease, all in mammals, by the use of substituted benzanilides which are CCR5 receptor antagonists. Furthermore, since CD8+T cells have been implicated in COPD, CCR5 may play a role in their recruitment and therefore antagonists to CCR5 could provide potential therapeutic in the treatment of COPD. Also, since CCR5 is a co-receptor for the entry of HIV into cells, selective receptor ligands may be useful in the treatment of HIV infection.",SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP,BONDINELL WILLIAM E;;CHAN JAMES A,,https://lens.org/034-923-258-126-938,Patent Application,no,0,0,23,23,0,A61K31/138;;A61K31/167;;A61K31/245;;A61K31/27;;A61K31/277;;A61K31/40;;A61K31/4245;;A61K31/438;;A61K31/445;;A61K31/4453;;A61K31/454;;A61K31/4741;;A61K31/4745;;A61K31/5375;;A61K31/55;;C07C233/75;;C07C233/80;;C07C255/57;;C07D271/06;;C07D295/088;;C07D407/12;;C07C2601/14;;A61P11/00;;A61P11/06;;A61P17/00;;A61P17/06;;A61P25/00;;A61P29/00;;A61P31/18;;A61P37/02;;A61P37/04;;A61P37/08;;A61P43/00;;A61P9/10;;A61K31/41;;C07D271/06;;C07C233/75;;C07D407/12;;A61K31/5375;;C07D295/088;;C07C233/80;;A61K31/55;;A61K31/438;;A61K31/167;;A61K31/277;;A61K31/40;;C07C255/57;;A61K31/445;;A61K31/4453;;A61K31/138;;A61K31/27;;A61K31/454;;A61K31/245;;A61K31/4245;;A61K31/4741;;A61K31/4745;;C07C2601/14,C07D295/08;;A61K31/138;;A61K31/165;;A61K31/167;;A61K31/245;;A61K31/27;;A61K31/277;;A61K31/40;;A61K31/4245;;A61K31/438;;A61K31/445;;A61K31/4453;;A61K31/454;;A61K31/4741;;A61K31/4745;;A61K31/4747;;A61K31/475;;A61K31/535;;A61K31/5375;;A61K31/55;;A61P9/10;;A61P11/06;;A61P17/00;;A61P17/06;;A61P29/00;;A61P31/18;;A61P37/02;;A61P37/04;;A61P37/08;;A61P43/00;;C07C233/75;;C07C233/80;;C07C255/57;;C07D207/16;;C07D211/14;;C07D271/06;;C07D295/092;;C07D407/12;;C07D413/12;;C07D491/10;;C07D491/20,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

At least two of the chemical moieties are relatively small molecules, usually less than about 7,000 Daltons in size. The spacer moiety is selected to impart certain steric properties to the conjugate. In one embodiment, the binding of a macromolecular specific binding partner to one of the chemical moieties sterically inhibits the binding of a different macromolecule to another chemical moiety. In another embodiment, the binding of a first chemical moiety to a macromolecule restricts the subsequent binding of a second chemical moiety to a proximate location on the same macromolecule. The three chemical moieties are preferably a nitrophenylazido residue, a phenyl boronic acid residue, and a solid support or a label such as biotin. The spacer is preferably cysteine, lysine, glutamic acid, pyroglutamic acid, S-acetylmercaptosuccinic anhydride or .omega.-carbobenzoxylysine. The conjugate is useful in immunoassays and for targeted labeling of proteins. In an assay, a sample is contacted with the conjugate, a limited quantity of analyte binding partner and an excess of small molecule binding partner.

Adicionalmente, essa invenção se refere ao tratamento e a prevenção dos estados de doenças mediados por meio de CCR5, incluindo, porém não limitados a, asma e distúrbios atópicos (por exemplo, alergias e dermatites atópicas), artrite reumatóide, sarcoidoses e outras doenças fibróticas, arteriosclerose, psoríase, doenças autoimunes tais como esclerose múltipla, e doença inflamatória intestinal, todos em mamíferos, pelo uso de benzanilidas substituídas as quais são antagonistas do receptor CCR5. Além do mais, uma vez que as células T CD8+ têm sido envolvidas no COPD, o CCR5 pode ter uma função em seus recrutamentos e com isso antagonizar o CCR5 poderia proporcionar uma terapêutica potencial no tratamento da COPD. Também, uma vez que o CCR5 é um co-receptor para a entrada do HIV para dentro das células, ligantes receptores seletivos podem ser úteis no tratamento da infecção por HIV.",SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORP,BONDINELL WILLIAM E;;CHAN JAMES A,,https://lens.org/008-799-749-233-000,Patent Application,no,0,0,23,23,0,A61K31/138;;A61K31/167;;A61K31/245;;A61K31/27;;A61K31/277;;A61K31/40;;A61K31/4245;;A61K31/438;;A61K31/445;;A61K31/4453;;A61K31/454;;A61K31/4741;;A61K31/4745;;A61K31/5375;;A61K31/55;;C07C233/75;;C07C233/80;;C07C255/57;;C07D271/06;;C07D295/088;;C07D407/12;;C07C2601/14;;A61P11/00;;A61P11/06;;A61P17/00;;A61P17/06;;A61P25/00;;A61P29/00;;A61P31/18;;A61P37/02;;A61P37/04;;A61P37/08;;A61P43/00;;A61P9/10;;A61K31/41;;C07D271/06;;C07C233/75;;C07D407/12;;A61K31/5375;;C07D295/088;;C07C233/80;;A61K31/55;;A61K31/438;;A61K31/167;;A61K31/277;;A61K31/40;;C07C255/57;;A61K31/445;;A61K31/4453;;A61K31/138;;A61K31/27;;A61K31/454;;A61K31/245;;A61K31/4245;;A61K31/4741;;A61K31/4745;;C07C2601/14,C07D295/08;;A61K31/138;;A61K31/165;;A61K31/167;;A61K31/245;;A61K31/27;;A61K31/277;;A61K31/40;;A61K31/4245;;A61K31/438;;A61K31/445;;A61K31/4453;;A61K31/454;;A61K31/4741;;A61K31/4745;;A61K31/4747;;A61K31/475;;A61K31/535;;A61K31/5375;;A61K31/55;;A61P9/10;;A61P11/06;;A61P17/00;;A61P17/06;;A61P29/00;;A61P31/18;;A61P37/02;;A61P37/04;;A61P37/08;;A61P43/00;;C07C233/75;;C07C233/80;;C07C255/57;;C07D207/16;;C07D211/14;;C07D271/06;;C07D295/092;;C07D407/12;;C07D413/12;;C07D491/10;;C07D491/20,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

At least two of the chemical moieties are relatively small molecules, usually less than about 7,000 Daltons in size. The spacer moiety is selected to impart certain steric properties to the conjugate. In one embodiment, the binding of a macromolecular specific binding partner to one of the chemical moieties sterically inhibits the binding of a different macromolecule to another chemical moieties. In another embodiment, the binding of a first chemical moiety to a macromolecule restricts the subsequent binding of a second tridentate member to a proximate location on the same macromolecule. The three chemical moieties are preferably a nitrophenylazido residue, a phenyl boronic acid residue, and a solid support or a label such as biotin. The spacer is preferably cysteine, lysine, glutamic acid, pyroglutamic acid, S-acetylmercaptosuccinic anhydride or .omega.-carbobenzoxylysine.

The detergent controller automatically learns the feed rate of the detergent dispenser used, regardless of the type of detergent dispenser being used. For each detergent feed cycle, the controller computes a Feed Factor equal to the amount of detergent feed on time required for each unit increase in the detergent concentration, which is the inverse of the detergent feed rate. The controller stores the computed Feed Factor for the last N feed cycles in a non-volatile memory, and computes a running average of the N feed factors stored in the non-volatile memory. Whenever the detergent dispenser is powered on, it determines the difference between the measured wash tank detergent concentration and a specified detergent concentration set point value. The computed average feed factor and the difference between the set point and the current detergent concentration are multiplied to compute a detergent feed on time. The detergent dispenser is then turned on for the computed feed on time, and after a suitable subsequent mixing period, the change in detergent concentration during the last feed cycle is determined and a new Feed Factor is computed and stored. The detergent concentration is preferably measured using logarithmic measurement units, and separate Feed Factors may be computed and used for at least two detergent concentration ranges.",DIVERSEY CORP,CHAN WAI YIN CEDRIC;;LIVINGSTON JAMES W,,https://lens.org/045-485-159-670-956,Granted Patent,no,0,0,7,7,0,A47L15/0055;;A47L15/449;;A47L2401/30;;A47L2501/07;;A47L2501/26;;G05D11/138;;Y10T137/8766;;Y10T137/8766;;G05D11/138;;A47L15/0055;;A47L2501/07;;A47L15/449;;A47L2501/26;;A47L2401/30,A47L15/44;;G05D11/13,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The detergent controller automatically learns the feed rate of the detergent dispenser used, regardless of the type of detergent dispenser being used. For each detergent feed cycle, the controller computes a Feed Factor equal to the amount of detergent feed on time required for each unit increase in the detergent concentration, which is the inverse of the detergent feed rate. The controller stores the computed Feed Factor for the last N feed cycles in a non-volatile memory, and computes a running average of the N feed factors stored in the non-volatile memory. Whenever the detergent dispenser is powered on, it determines the difference between the measured wash tank detergent concentration and a specified detergent concentration set point value. The computed average feed factor and the difference between the set point and the current detergent concentration are multiplied to compute a detergent feed on time. The detergent dispenser is then turned on for the computed feed on time, and after a suitable subsequent mixing period, the change in detergent concentration during the last feed cycle is determined and a new Feed Factor is computed and stored. The detergent concentration is preferably measured using logarithmic measurement units, and separate Feed Factors may be computed and used for at least two detergent concentration ranges.",DIVERSEY CORP,CHAN WAI Y C;;LIVINGSTON JAMES W,DIVERSEY IP INTERNATIONAL BV (2003-09-08);;DIVERSEY CORPORATION (1994-07-08),https://lens.org/062-657-096-499-825,Granted Patent,yes,7,133,7,7,0,A47L15/0055;;A47L15/449;;A47L2401/30;;A47L2501/07;;A47L2501/26;;G05D11/138;;Y10T137/8766;;Y10T137/8766;;G05D11/138;;A47L15/0055;;A47L2501/07;;A47L15/449;;A47L2501/26;;A47L2401/30,A47L15/44;;G05D11/13,134/18;;X134 56D;;X134 57D;;X134 58D;;137/897,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Each channel of the system is provided with light source that is temporally and spectrally modulated by an encoder. Modulation is accomplished by first passing the data through a pulse modifier to obtain a stream of shortened pulses with a reduced duty cycle. The modulated light is coupled to a fiber and data are recovered by the decoder. The source includes a superluminescent fiber source that is split multiple times and amplified in a hierarchical manner to produce a plurality of like sources. The like sources are decorrelated by adding delays to the different sources. Each of the encoders includes an encoding mask having a first code that encodes the optical signal. Light, spatially encoded by the mask and temporally modulated with data, is transmitted over a fiber link with the signals of other users and received by a decoder. Within each decoder, a polarization insensitive separator splits the received light into two equal power components which are provided to two decoding masks used to decode the signal. One of the masks has a second code identical to the first code and the other mask has a third code complementary to the first code. The output light beams filtered by the masks are differentially detected to generate an output signal, which is further processed for data recovery. The electrical signal is low pass filtered and electrically square law detected. The first codes are selected from a set of unipolar codes derived from a set of balanced bipolar orthogonal codes.

    A method for manufacturing low cost electroluminescent (EL) lamps is disclosed. The method of the present invention includes the first step of die cutting, embossing or chemically etching the metal foil surface of a metal foil bonded flexible electrical insulation to simultaneously form one or more rear capacitive electrodes, electrical terminations, optical registration fiducial indicia, and a continuous carrier means that is then coupled to a precisely positioned indexing system. Next, the rear metal foil capacitive electrodes are coated with a capacitive dielectric layer precisely isolating the rear electrode form. In the third step, a layer of electroluminescent phosphor ink is applied to the rear capacitive electrodes to precisely form areas of illumination. In step four, a layer of light transmissive and electrically conductive ink is applied to cover the EL phosphor layer. Next, in step five a transparent polyester film or ultraviolet activated dielectric coating is applied to the entire surface of the lamp.

A presente invenção refere-se a um sistema de comunicações de fibra ótica de usuário múltiplo usa técnicas de acesso múltiplo de divisão de código de espectro amplo para a obtenção de uma melhor utilização de largura de banda. Cada canal do sistema é provido com uma fonte de luz que é modulada de forma temporária e espectral por meio de um codificador. A modulação é realizada primeiro passando o dado através de um modificador de pulso, para a obtenção de um fluxo de pulsos encurtados com um ciclo de carga reduzido. A luz modulada é acoplada a uma fibra, e os dados são recuperados pelo decodificador. A fonte inclui uma fonte de fibra superluminescente, que é dividida múltiplas vezes e amplificada de uma maneira hierárquica, para a produção de uma pluralidade de fontes similares. As fontes similares são descorrelacionadas pela adição de atrasos às fontes diferentes. Cada um dos codificadores inclui uma máscara de codificação, que tem um primeiro código, que codifica o sinal ótico. A luz, codificada espacialmente pela máscara e temporariamente modulada com os dados, é transmitida por uma ligação de fibra com os sinais de outros usuários e recebida por um decodificador. Em cada decodificador, um separador insensível à polarização divide a luz recebida em duas componentes de potência igual, as quais são providas para duas máscaras de decodificação usadas para a decodificação do sinal. Uma das máscaras tem um segundo código idêntico ao primeiro código, e a outra máscara tem um terceiro código complementar ao primeiro código. Os feixes de luz extraídos filtrados pelas máscaras são detectados de forma diferencial, para a geração de um sinal de saída, o qual é posteriormente processado para a recuperação de dados. O sinal elétrico é filtrado com passagem baixa e uma lei eletricamente quadrada é detectada. Os primeiros códigos são selecionados a partir de um conjunto de códigos unipolares, derivados a partir de um conjunto de códigos ortogonais bipolares equilibrados. Os códigos podem ser binários ou analógicos.",CODESTREAM TECHNOLOGIES CORP,DUTT BIRENDRA;;NARAGHI MANOUHER;;CHAN JAMES K,,https://lens.org/187-037-592-109-190,Patent Application,no,0,0,8,8,0,H04B10/503;;H04B10/516;;H04J11/0023;;H04J14/007;;H04B10/25;;H04B10/00,H04J14/00;;H04B10/50;;H04B10/516;;H04J11/00;;H04J13/00;;H04J14/04;;H04J14/06,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   A method for manufacturing low cost electroluminescent (EL) lamps is disclosed. The method of the present invention includes the first step of die cutting, embossing or chemically etching the metal foil surface of a metal foil bonded flexible electrical insulation to simultaneously form one or more rear capacitive electrodes, electrical terminations, optical registration fiducial indicia, and a continuous carrier means that is then coupled to a precisely positioned indexing system. Next, the rear metal foil capacitive electrodes are coated with a capacitive dielectric layer precisely isolating the rear electrode form. In the third step, a layer of electroluminescent phosphor ink is applied to the rear capacitive electrodes to precisely form areas of illumination. In step four, a layer of light transmissive and electrically conductive ink is applied to cover the EL phosphor layer. Next, in step five a transparent polyester film or ultraviolet activated dielectric coating is applied to the entire surface of the lamp.

Each channel of the system is provided with light source that is temporally and spectrally modulated by an encoder. Modulation is accomplished by first passing the data through a pulse modifier to obtain a stream of shortened pulses with a reduced duty cycle. The modulated light is coupled to a fiber and data are recovered by the decoder. The source includes a superluminescen t fiber source that is split multiple times and amplified in a hierarchical manner to produce a plurality of like sources. The like sources are decorrelated by adding delays to the different sources. Each of the encoders includes an encoding mask having a first code that encodes the optical signa l. Light, spatially encoded by the mask and temporally modulated with data, is transmitted over a fiber link with the signals of other users and received b y a decoder. Within each decoder, a polarization insensitive separator splits the received light into two equal power components which are provided to two decoding masks used to decode the signal. One of the masks has a second code identical to the first code and the other mask has a third code complementar y to the first code.The output light beams filtered by the masks are differentially detected to generate an output signal, which is further processed for data recovery. The electrical signal is low pass filtered and electrically square law detected. The first codes are selected from a set of unipolar codes derived from a set of balanced bipolar orthogonal codes.

In one electrophotographic printing species of this invention, there is disclosed a method of electrophotographic color printing which includes mixing a plurality of colors in a single plane and in dot-next-to-dot (DND) pixels within a plurality of super pixels to produce a color image, whereby the sum or the multi-color dots printed in any super pixel is limited to the number of subdivided individual pixels therein (Pg 28 line 19 et seq.), thereby assuring dot-next-to-dot (DND) always printing of said colors in a single plane. The above method further includes varying the area of each printed color dot within each pixel of a super pixel in order to control the gray scale of a printed color image. Gray scale printing is achieved by controlling the selection of a gray table entry level number (Pg. 29 line 20 et seq.) representative of one of several available entry level numbers corresponding to a plurality of different dot loadings for a corresponding plurality of differently printed super pixels.",HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY,"CHAN, C.S.;;NELSON, TERRY M.;;BEARSS, JAMES G.",,https://lens.org/049-577-540-733-307,Search Report,yes,6,0,8,8,0,B41J2/2128;;H04N1/40087;;H04N1/4057;;H04N1/52;;H04N1/40087;;H04N1/52;;B41J2/2128;;H04N1/4057,H04N1/23;;H04N1/40;;H04N1/405;;H04N1/46;;H04N1/52,,1,1,146-005-744-874-067,10.1109/icassp.1986.1169037,"ICASSP 86 Proceedings, 7-11 April 1986, Tokyo (JP) (International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing), vol. 1, 1986, New York (US) pages 541-544; K.

    This is a combination method and system for intravascularly accessing and visualizing a body structure. A system is disclosed comprising a sheath, a balloon catheter, and a catheter deflection mechanism. A micro-deflection mechanism, which may be placed into the lumen of devices such as cardiac leads or electrophysiology catheters, is also provided for accurate guidance and placement of such devices to their target location. In one embodiment, a procedure for a lead or catheter placement is described in which a combination deflection mechanism, balloon catheter, and sheath assembly access the coronary sinus ostium via a superior approach. A distal balloon on the catheter is inflated and an occlusive venogram is obtained under fluoroscopic guidance to visualize the coronary veins. The sheath is advanced into the coronary sinus ostium and the balloon is deflated. The catheter and deflection mechanism are then removed. Next, a micro-deflection mechanism that has been inserted into the lumen of a cardiac lead is deployed through the sheath, allowing the lead to deflect with a high degree of accuracy and control as it is placed in the selected location.

Furthermore, since CD8+ T cells have been implicated in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ('COPD'), CCR5 may play a role in their recruitment and therefore antagonists to CCR5 could provide potential therapeutic in the treatment of COPD.

   This is a combination method and system for intravascularly accessing and visualizing a body structure. A system is disclosed comprising a sheath, a balloon catheter, and a catheter deflection mechanism. A micro-deflection mechanism, which may be placed into the lumen of devices such as cardiac leads or electrophysiology catheters, is also provided for accurate guidance and placement of such devices to their target location. In one embodiment, a procedure for a lead or catheter placement is described in which a combination deflection mechanism, balloon catheter, and sheath assembly access the coronary sinus ostium via a superior approach. A distal balloon on the catheter is inflated and an occlusive venogram is obtained under fluoroscopic guidance to visualize the coronary veins. The sheath is advanced into the coronary sinus ostium and the balloon is deflated. The catheter and deflection mechanism are then removed. Next, a micro-deflection mechanism that has been inserted into the lumen of a cardiac lead is deployed through the sheath, allowing the lead to deflect with a high degree of accuracy and control as it is placed in the selected location.

    Station scan circuitry for a radio-frequency receiver and corresponding methods are disclosed that efficiently determine the presence of a station on available channels. The station scan circuitry includes circuitry that determines if the signal power on a given channel exceeds a threshold value. Additional circuitry compares the channel signal strength and the adjacent channel signal to determine if a ratio of the two exceeds a threshold level. If both the signal power and the signal strength ratio are sufficient, the station scan circuitry indicates that a station has been found. To make the signal strength comparison, the station scan circuitry includes circuitry for determining a post-filter signal strength and a pre-filter signal strength for the received signal.

Such profiles may also be stored at the local switch level, and be made accessible to all other nodes via the signaling network. The present invention extends service logic functionality for a given subscriber to allow for the interaction of subscriber profiles on behalf of a single subscriber, and sharing of data contained in these profiles, to enhance single-ended, single point-of-control services specific to either the calling or called party offered in an Intelligent Network. As such, an enhanced service tailored to both the called and calling parties is made available.

One process involves applying a clustering algorithm to a user's collection of items. Information about the resulting clusters is then used to select items to use as recommendation sources. Another process involves displaying the clusters of items to the user via a collection management interface that enables the user to attach cluster-level metadata, such as by rating or tagging entire clusters of items. The resulting metadata may be used to improve the recommendations generated by a recommendation engine. Another process involves forming clusters of items in which a user has indicated a lack of interest, and using these clusters to filter the output of a recommendation engine.

The method can be used with an electronic network, preferably the World Wide Web. A vendor program running on a vendor system (330) displays promotional items on a promotional Web page (302). When a customer selects promotional items (306), the vendor program queries a database (304) to determine the customer's eligibility to participate in the business promotion. An ineligible customer (318) is offered the opportunity to purchase the items at a non-promotional rate (324), or to cancel the order (326). The promotional items are delivered (342) to an eligible customer (344) at the promotional rate. An eligible customer is also sent a persistent cookie (316) that is used to notify the vendor program to display a non-promotional Web page during the customer's subsequent visits to the vendor's Web site. The eligible customer is sent a URL link with an encrypted unique key (336) for associating referred new customers (400) to the customer. An incentive is rewarded (406) to the customer for each referred customer who participates in the business program. A tally Web page displays referred customer information. Incentive awards can be selected from a redemption Web page. Upon selection of an incentive award, the vendor program updates the tally and redemption pages, and the database. The vendor program makes arrangements to have the incentives delivered to the referring customer.

If they are in that mode, then partial track staging by the RAID array control from the fixed-block formatted HDDs to a subsystem cache or the like would reduce device contention by reading and staging less than full track.

    A method and system for detecting and processing armed triggers associated with specific call functions in an intelligent network, using a distributed intelligent network triggering architecture. The complex trigger profile is removed from call processing at the service switching point to a trigger processing server, so that a much simplified and reduced profile can be sent to the service switching point associated with a roaming subscriber, which overcomes the problem of lack of support for long messages within the signalling infrastructure, and the problems associated with wide variation in the capabilities of service switching points. The reduced processing at the service switching point means that the detection points for armed triggers residing therein need only have a minimal triggering capability and a generic trigger for each detection point, and therefore do not need to be upgraded as new triggers are defined or as new criteria are defined for existing triggers at a given detection point. Such upgrades need only be dealt with in the trigger processing server and since the trigger processing server is normally part of the subscriber's home network, it can be upgraded as required to provide the subscriber with much greater consistency of services and features when roaming to other networks.

This technique will significantly reduce the access time. More specifically, in this invention, the output of a digitalto-analog converter (DAC) is used to control the output voltage level of a voltage regulator circuit which supplies the voltage of the stepper motor drive transistors. In order to optimize the drive voltage output from the voltage regulator to the stepper motor for each disc drive, a series of seeks is performed using identical starting and target tracks. As each seek is performed, the input to the DAC is incremented by the microprocessor, causing the stepper motor drive voltage to be increased in one millivolt increments. A ring detector (which provides an output count of the number of target track crossings by the transducer before the transducer settles on the target track) monitors the settling time of the head over the center of the target track. The data identifying the voltage regulator output which results in minimum ringout count is stored and used from then on for that stepper motor disc drive system as the optimum access tuned voltage. This data will be applied by the microprocessor to a DAC, and output from the voltage regulator to the stepper motor drivers during each stepping sequence. Typically, this tuning process is originally accomplished when the disc drive is first powered on and is part of the normal power-on recalibration routine The disc drive could also be retuned on command or by any other interrupt routine parameter such as time or temperature change. Alternatively, the calculated optimum drive voltage could be stored on a non-user accessible track of the disc surface of the disc drive, and automatically accessed as part of the power-on routine for the disc drive.",SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY,KRAUSE JAMES N;;TREMAINE BRIAN P;;CHAN LITKO R,,https://lens.org/059-089-256-622-087,Patent Application,no,0,0,5,5,0,G11B5/5521;;G11B5/5521;;G11B21/083;;G11B21/083,G11B5/55;;G11B21/08;;H02P8/00,D4352002133  M,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The system includes a CPU, a host bus coupled to the CPU, a host-bus-to-peripheral-device-bus (HB/PDB) bridge coupled to the host bus, at least one PD, at least one peripheral device bus coupling the HB/PDB bridge and at least one PD, and a device, typically in the form of a digital gate, for selectively disabling and re-enabling at least one PD. The disclosed method operates in connection with a computer system having a CPU, a HB/PDB bridge coupled to the CPU and capable of sending a device-configuration-space-access-signal (DCSAS) to the DCSAS input pin of a target PD when attempting an access operation, such as a read or a write operation, on the target PD, and one or more system I/O registers having a CONFIG ENABLE bit that reflects a user's request to disable or re-enable a PD. The method intercepts the DCSAS before it reaches the DCSAS input pin of the target PD, provides the intercepted DCSAS to the input of a digital gate such as an AND gate, provides a signal corresponding to the CONFIG ENABLE bit to the input of the same digital gate, and delivers the resulting output signal from the digital gate to the DCSAS input pin of the target PD.",DELL USA LP,CHAN WAI-MING RICHARD;;HAYES STUART;;ARTSDALEN JAMES VAN,DELL USA LP (1998-02-13),https://lens.org/102-313-451-301-634,Granted Patent,yes,12,42,1,2,0,G06F13/4063;;G06F13/4063,G06F13/40,710/8;;710/200;;710/260;;711/170;;711/163,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Using this method, pixels are selected and printed in such a manner as to maximize the uniformity of ink distribution on the printed media. This method will work using either a variable drop size or a fixed drop size with variable dye loadings. It will also work with most error diffusion or dithering schemes presently used and available in the image processing arts.

This generic method is applicable to both ink jet and electrophotographic printing species of this invention. In one electrophotographic printing species of this invention, there is disclosed a method of electrophotographic color printing which includes mixing a plurality of colors in a single plane and in dot-next-to-dot (DND) pixels within a plurality of super pixels to produce a color image, whereby the sum or the multi-color dots printed in any super pixel is limited to the number of subdivided individual pixels therein (Pg 28 line 19 et seq.), thereby assuring dot-next-to-dot (DND) always printing of said colors in a single plane. The above method further includes varying the area of each printed color dot within each pixel of a super pixel in order to control the gray scale of a printed color image. Gray scale printing is achieved by controlling the selection of a gray table entry level number (Pg. 29 line 20 et seq.) representative of one of several available entry level numbers corresponding to a plurality of different dot loadings for a corresponding plurality of differently printed super pixels.",HEWLETT PACKARD CO,CHAN C S;;NELSON TERRY M;;BEARSS JAMES G,,https://lens.org/047-567-616-041-904,Patent Application,yes,0,21,8,8,0,B41J2/2128;;H04N1/40087;;H04N1/4057;;H04N1/52;;H04N1/40087;;H04N1/52;;B41J2/2128;;H04N1/4057,H04N1/23;;H04N1/40;;H04N1/405;;H04N1/46;;H04N1/52,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

This technique will significantly reduce the access time. More specifically, in this invention, the output of a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is used to control the output voltage level of a voltage regulator circuit which supplies the voltage of the stepper motor drive transistors. In order to optimize the drive voltage output from the voltage regulator to the stepper motor for each disc drive, circuitry is provided to determine the minimum settling time for a specific actuator movement resulting from the application of a given drive voltage. A detector circuit monitors the settling time of the head over the center of the target track. The data identifying the voltage regulator output which results in minimum settling time is stored and used from then on for that stepper motor disc drive system as the optimum access tuned voltage. This data will be applied by the microprocessor to a DAC, and output from the voltage regulator to the stepper motor drivers during each stepping sequence. Typically, this tuning process is originally accomplished when the disc drive is first powered on and is part of the normal power-on recalibration routine.",SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY,KRAUSE JAMES N;;TREMAINE BRIAN P;;CHAN LITKO R,SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY INC.

This technique will significantly reduce the access time. More specifically, in this invention, the output of a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) (50) is used to control the output voltage level of a voltage regulator circuit (Figure 4) which supplies the voltage of the stepper motor drive transistors (Q3 58; Q2 63; Q1 54). In order to optimize the drive voltage output from the voltage regulator to the stepper motor (14) for each disc drive, a series of seeks is performed using identical starting and target tracks. As each seek is performed, the input to the DAC is incremented by a microprocessor (11) causing the stepper motor drive voltage to be increased in one milli-volt increments. A ring detector (32) (which provides an output count of the number of target track crossings by the transducer (10) before the transducer settles on the target track) monitors the settling time of the head over the center of the target track. The data identifying the voltage regulator output which results in minimum ring-out count is stored and used from then on for that stepper motor disc drive system as the optimum access tuned voltage. This data will be applied by the microprocessor to a DAC, and output from the voltage regulator to the stepper motor drivers during each stepping sequence. Typically, this tuning process is originally accomplished when the disc drive is first powered on and is part of the normal power-on recalibration routine. The disc drive could also be returned on   command or by any other interrupt routine parameter such as time or temperature change. Alternatively, the calculated optimum drive voltage could be stored on a non-user accessible track of the disc surface of the disc drive, and automatically accessed as part of the power-on rountine for the disc drive.

   In accordance with the objects of this invention, a new method of fabricating a polysilicon gate transistor is achieved. An alternating aperture phase shift mask (AAPSM) is used to pattern polysilicon gates in a single exposure without a trim mask. A semiconductor substrate is provided. A gate dielectric layer is deposited. A polysilicon layer is deposited. The polysilicon layer, the gate dielectric layer and the semiconductor substrate are patterned to form trenches for planned shallow trench isolations (STI). A trench oxide layer is deposited filling the trenches. The trench oxide layer is polished down to the top surface of the polysilicon layer to complete the STI. A photoresist layer is deposited and patterned to form a feature mask for planned polysilicon gates. The patterning is by a single exposure using an AAPSM mask. Unwanted features in the photoresist pattern that are caused by phase conflicts overlie the STI. The polysilicon layer is etched to form the polysilicon gates.

The method involves determining the maximum allowable ink print density necessary to reduce or eliminate paper cockleing in the printed media and then providing tight control of the selection of gray scale ink drop count and associated dye loading in relation to this maximum allowable print density. Using this method, pixels are selected and printed in such a manner as to maximize the uniformity of ink distribution on the printed media. This method will work using either a variable drop size or a fixed drop size with variable dye loadings. It will also work with most error diffusion or dithering schemes presently used and available in the image processing arts.  ",HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY,"CHAN, C.

This technique will significantly reduce the access time. More specifically, in this invention, the output of a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) (50) is used to control the output voltage level of a voltage regulator circuit (Figure 4) which supplies the voltage of the stepper motor drive transistors (Q3 58; Q2 63; Q1 54). In order to optimize the drive voltage output from the voltage regulator to the stepper motor (14) for each disc drive, a series of seeks is performed using identical starting and target tracks. As each seek is performed, the input to the DAC is incremented by a microprocessor (11) causing the stepper motor drive voltage to be increased in one milli-volt increments. A ring detector (32) (which provides an output count of the number of target track crossings by the transducer (10) before the transducer settles on the target track) monitors the settling time of the head over the center of the target track. The data identifying the voltage regulator output which results in minimum ring-out count is stored and used from then on for that stepper motor disc drive system as the optimum access tuned voltage. This data will be applied by the microprocessor to a DAC, and output from the voltage regulator to the stepper motor drivers during each stepping sequence. Typically, this tuning process is originally accomplished when the disc drive is first powered on and is part of the normal power-on recalibration routine. The disc drive could also be returned on   command or by any other interrupt routine parameter such as time or temperature change. Alternatively, the calculated optimum drive voltage could be stored on a non-user accessible track of the disc surface of the disc drive, and automatically accessed as part of the power-on rountine for the disc drive.

This geometry consists of a plurality of base segments upon which have been formed a corresponding plurality of post segments of greater vertical dimension and smaller lateral dimension than the base seg­ments. This mask geometry enables greater center-to-center orifice spacing to be achieved without unacceptably reducing the thickness and structural integrity of the nozzle plate.

The pressure is provided by progressive recovery of a sleeve as it is released from a holdout (1) which holds it in a recoverable configuration. The progressive recovery can be, for example, from one end of the sleeve to the other or from the center of the sleeve outwards to each end. The progressive shrinkage can be achieved, for example, by use of an external holdout which releases an inner expanded sleeve when contacted with solvent around the circumference of the sleeve commencing at one end of the sleeve and continuing along the sleeve to the other end. <IMAGE>",RAYCHEM CORP,MOLINARI ROBERT JAMES;;CHANDLER DANIEL ALAN;;CHAN CHI-MING,,https://lens.org/180-836-622-412-403,Patent Application,no,0,0,7,9,0,B29C61/065;;B29C63/42;;B32B7/04;;F16L58/10;;B32B3/26;;B32B7/12,B29C61/06;;B29C63/42;;B32B7/04;;F16L58/10,F2P PC19          PC19;;F2P P1A35         PC19;;F2P P1B7F         PC19;;U1S S1754;;U1S S2311;;U1S S2316,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
