   A printer on a networked gaming device can be controlled by the network to generate awards. The printer can operate as both a typical printer in a gaming device and as a printer for the gaming network, or separate printers can be installed in the gaming device. If the particular player has identified himself or herself to the gaming network, then the gaming system has a very high probability that it is communicating to a known player. Therefore, the printer operates as a direct communication conduit to a player. Additionally, previously issued awards can be redeemed by a validator coupled to the gaming network.

   The present invention integrates the concepts of interactive player based promotions, games, and bonusing that utilize a touch screen display on a gaming system associated with a remote player tracking system. The promotions are configured at a remote configuration workstation by selecting system criteria defining the particular bonus promotion to thereby create a bonus rule. Promotions have four primary criteria. The first is the Trigger which is the criterion that determines when the bonus screen is activated to display a promotion. The second is the Interface that determines what will be displayed on the bonus screen. The third is the Award in which the nature of the bonus payment, including the method of choosing the value to award and the required player interaction to receive the promotion, is determined. And finally, the Currency system determines the method of payment to the player for earning or receiving the promotion.

The second is the “Interface” that determines what will be displayed on the bonus screen. The third is the “Award” in which the nature of the bonus payment, including the method of choosing the value to award and the required player interaction to receive the promotion, is determined.

The promotions are configured at a remote configuration workstation by selecting system criteria defining the particular bonus promotion to thereby create a “bonus rule.” Promotions have four primary criteria. The first is the “Trigger” which is the criterion that determines when the bonus screen is activated to display a promotion. The second is the “Interface” that determines what will be displayed on the bonus screen. The third is the “Award” in which the nature of the bonus payment, including the method of choosing the value to award and the required player interaction to receive the promotion, is determined.

Surges in the mixture's flow are dampened, and the mixture is constrained to have a limited horizontal flow velocity through the tank of the apparatus. A separator chamber with a plurality of parallel subchannels formed by spaced vertical plates has a geometry that reduces and controls the Reynolds number of the subchannels and controls the velocity through the subchannels, causing the flow therethrough to be substantially non-turbulent. A first gate inhibits the flow of sediment into the separator chamber. The flow path length through the separator chamber is such that the particles will have sufficient time to rise above a downstream exit, near the bottom of the separator chamber, and into a holding chamber. A transverse velocity gradient formed within the subchannels cause the particles to spin and follow a curved path toward the lower longitudinal velocity regions adjacent the walls of the subchannels where the particles agglomerate and rise to the surface.

Surges in the mixture's flow are dampened, and the mixture is constrained to have a limited horizontal flow velocity through the tank of the apparatus. A separator chamber with a plurality of parallel subchannels formed by spaced vertical plates has a geometry that reduces and controls the Reynolds number of the subchannels and controls the velocity through the subchannels, causing the flow therethrough to be substantially non-turbulent. A first gate inhibits the flow of sediment into the separator chamber. The flow path length through the separator chamber is such that the particles will have sufficient time to rise above a downstream exit, near the bottom of the separator chamber, and into a holding chamber. A transverse velocity gradient formed within the subchannels causes the particles to spin and follow a curved path toward the lower longitudinal velocity regions adjacent the walls of the subchannels where the particles agglomerate and rise to the surface. A vertical rising unit is optionally provided to remove very tiny particles that have insufficient buoyancy to rise above the separator chamber's exit, and various filters may remove other impurities.",GNESYS INC,GREENE BOYD B;;NASSIF NAJI JOSEPH;;SCOTT ANDERSON JR,,https://lens.org/150-399-187-691-784,Granted Patent,no,0,0,13,13,0,B01D17/0211;;B01D21/0039;;B01D17/0211;;B01D21/0039,B01D17/02;;B01D21/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A method for improving a scoring process includes displaying an original scanned image of a hard copy page of an answer to a scorer. If the scorer determines that the image is of insufficient quality to read, an electronic request for an improved image is received from the scorer and routed electronically to an archive containing the hard copy page, from which the page is retrieved. The retrieved page is rescanned to form a new image, which is then electronically transmitted to the scorer for scoring. A system includes hardware and software elements, including a processor and a database accessible by the processor containing original scanned images of answer pages. A scorer display and an input device are located at a scoring site, and an archive display and a scanner at an archive site. Software as described above is resident on the processor for implementing the method steps.

    A frequency addressable ignitor control device utilizes electronic bandpass filters tuned to a unique center frequency and bandwidth for each ignitor. Energy generated by the system's controller comprises one or more narrow pulses whose center frequency corresponds to one or more bandpass filter/ignitor assemblies and sufficient energy for activation. A plurality of bandpass filter/ignitor assemblies are connected in parallel in the system. The controller generates electrical pulses of different frequencies transferred to the plurality of bandpass filter/ignitor assemblies via a two wire ignitor bus. Bandpass filter/ignitor assemblies whose filter allows sufficient energy to pass to an ignitor bridge element initiates the ignitor's explosive charge. The controller generates energy to the ignitor with appropriate sequence of frequencies and delays resulting in the desired detonation of appropriate individual bandpass filter/ignitor assemblies in the desired sequential order each with the desired delays.

Teeth whitening method involves using a teeth whitening agent in relation to the tooth and continuous irradiation of the tooth with light. Dental bleaching agent contains hydrogen peroxide in concentration ranging from 2 wt% to 10 wt% in terms of total weight of tooth whitening agent. Light continuously irradiating the tooth is generated by the light source during a radiation period of time. Light has a wavelength in range of 375 nm to 420 nm, and the light source emits light at radiation flux density in range of 0.3 mW/cmup to 8.1 mW/cmTeeth whitening method involves using a tooth whitening agent in relation to a tooth, irradiating the tooth with light and after a period of irradiation, terminating the irradiation of the tooth with light for a period of time providing recovery, thus completing the treatment cycle. Dental bleaching agent contains hydrogen peroxide in concentration ranging from 2 wt% to 10 wt% in terms of total weight of tooth whitening agent. Light continuously irradiating the tooth is generated by the light source during a radiation period of time. Light has a wavelength in range of 390 nm to 420 nm, and the irradiation time period ranges from 300 seconds to 1,800 seconds. Light source emits light at irradiation flux density lying in range of 0.3 mW/cmup to 8.1 mW/cm.Treatment cycle is repeated 3 to 8 times. Method of clarifying a coffee spot on teeth involves applying a hydrogen peroxide solution on a tooth and irradiating a coffee spot with light emitted from a light source. Light has a wavelength in range of 390 nm to 430 nm, and the light source emits light at radiation flux density in range of 3.0 mW/cmup to 8.1 mW/cm. Method of clarifying a tea spot on teeth involves applying a hydrogen peroxide solution on a tooth and irradiating a tea spot with light emitted from a light source. Light has a wavelength in range of 390 nm to 430 nm, and the light source emits light at radiation flux density in range of 3.0 mW/cmup to 8.1 mW/cm. Method of clarifying a wine spot on teeth involves applying a hydrogen peroxide solution onto a tooth and irradiating the wine spot with light emitted from the light source. Light has a wavelength in range of 390 nm to 450 nm, and the light source emits light at radiation flux density in range of 3.0 mW/cmup to 8.1 mW/cm. Method of teeth whitening involves application of tooth whitening agent in relation to tooth, irradiation of tooth surface with light emitted from light source, and after expiration of irradiation period irradiation of surface of tooth with light for a period of time providing recovery, thus completing cycle of treatment. Dental bleaching agent contains hydrogen peroxide in concentration ranging from 2 wt% to 10 wt% in terms of total weight of tooth whitening agent. Light has a wavelength in range of 375 nm to 420 nm, and a radiation flux density at irradiation period of 300 seconds to 1,800 seconds. At that, radiation flux density is in range from 0.3 mW/cmup to 8.1 mW/cm.Treatment cycle is repeated 3 to 8 times. Light emitted from the light source is separated from the tooth surface by a distance lying in range from 0 mm to 12 mm.EFFECT: group of inventions provides teeth whitening due to concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the bleaching agent, light parameters, which irradiate the tooth, exposure time of light to the tooth and distance between the light source and the tooth.19 cl, 7 dwg, 10 tbl, 9 ex",COLGATE PALMOLIVE CO,JOHANSSON PATRIK;;LAVENDER STACEY;;DEMAREST SCOTT;;ADAMS RICHARD;;BOYD THOMAS;;PATEL MADHUSUDAN,,https://lens.org/092-193-301-862-490,Granted Patent,no,4,0,17,17,0,A61C19/066;;A61C19/06;;A61Q11/02;;A61C19/066;;A61N5/062;;A61N2005/0606;;A61N2005/0663,A61C19/06;;A61Q11/02,,1,1,066-248-150-153-381,10.1016/j.jdent.2004.01.003;;15053912,"SULIEMAN M. et al.

The speed of the wire and the force of the air stream may be digitally controlled by a processor, controller, microprocessor, or other computing device to ensure that a desired image resolution is achieved. Because the fluid delivery system is free of most of the mechanical limitations of traditional ink jet print heads, the system is compatible with adhesive application. When compared to the traditional coating operations for adhesives, the fluid delivery system allows controlled delivery, both in terms of location on the print medium and drop size (and thus coat weight). The system thus allows for greater positional and coat weight control of adhesives on the print medium or substrate, which is especially useful where precise control is desired.",3M INNOVATIVE PROPERTIES CO;;BOYD SCOTT A;;LEE JENNIFER L;;SEVERANCE RICHARD L;;WEAVER BILLY L,BOYD SCOTT A;;LEE JENNIFER L;;SEVERANCE RICHARD L;;WEAVER BILLY L,,https://lens.org/114-043-923-583-51X,Patent Application,yes,4,0,1,2,0,B05D1/28;;B05B7/2483;;B05D3/042;;B05D5/10,B05D1/16;;B05C3/02,,0,0,,,,PENDING

This reflected data modulated read beam is detected by detector (142) to recover the recorded data. The data image in the reflected data modulated read beam is detected to recover the recorded data. The data image in the reflected data modulated read beam is also used to generate an auto tracking control signal for electronics (156) which automatically adjusts the positioning of the objective lens (152) for proper positioning of the read beam on the recording media. The data track is, therefore, automatically tracked while the data track is being read during a read function.","E-SYSTEMS, INC.","HAMILTON, Scott, M.;;FREDERICK, Billy, C.;;McCOY, William, D.;;BOYD, James, R.;;MONTANA, Michael, W.",,https://lens.org/090-141-879-714-454,Search Report,yes,0,0,1,1,0,,G11B7/003;;G11B7/09;;G11B7/13;;G11B7/14,,0,0,,,,UNKNOWN

    A secondary game operable on a gaming machine top box includes visual representations of a plurality of bingo cards formed of five columns, each column corresponding to a letter in B-I-N-G-O. The secondary game also includes peripheral spaces on the top box corresponding to each letter on each card. Qualified players, e.g. those making a maximum bet on the base game, cause the secondary game to operate whereby one of the peripheral spaces is selected. A letter causes the column on the card associated with that letter to be lit; however, the cards must be completed sequentially so that the B column must be lit before I and so forth. Completely filling out one or more of the bingo cards results in a selected award associated with that winning card. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a bonus script is built that predetermines the number of plays made and the bonus amount received. The player then simply plays out the script until the bonus amount is one.

A game may span several gaming sessions. States of a game, for example a bonus game, may be stored when the player decides to stop playing the game. When the player initiates a next gaming session, at the same or another location, the previous state of the game is re-loaded onto the gaming machine and the player returns to the previous state.
