The lease to a domain name according to the present invention can include the right of the lessee such that the lease remains in effect during the term of the lease even if the ownership of the domain name is transferred to another party. For the winning bidder, the lease to the domain name affords the same benefits and advantages of owning the domain name outright for the duration of the lease term. However, the lessee needs to pay only a fraction of the price of owning the domain name outright.
