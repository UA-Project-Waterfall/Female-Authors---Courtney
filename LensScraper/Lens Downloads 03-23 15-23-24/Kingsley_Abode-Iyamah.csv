An inflatable balloon on the peritoneal catheter precludes migration or displacement of the catheter in the peritoneal cavity, thereby eliminating or minimizing corrective revision surgery.",UNIV IOWA RES FOUND,FLOUTY OLIVER ELIAS;;ABODE-IYAMAH KINGSLEY OTSIOREN;;HOWARD MATTHEW A;;GREENLEE JEREMY D,,https://lens.org/146-988-193-585-823,Patent Application,yes,8,0,1,1,0,A61M27/006;;A61M27/006,A61M27/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The plate is mounted to the skull and protects the brain exposed in the skull opening. A plate is initially spaced above the skull with gaskets or spacers so as to preclude pressure on the brain. The gaskets or spacers are resorptive, or otherwise dissolve or shrink over time, until the plate settles upon the skull. An elastic web extending over the plate provides a constant force to pull the plate towards the skull as the spacers shrink. The plate is secured to the skull using screws. The plate may include alignment posts residing adjacent the skull opening to maintain proper positioning of the plate as the spacers shrink. The plate eliminates the need for a second cranioplasty surgical procedure.",UNIV IOWA RES FOUND,HOWARD MATTHEW A;;GROSLAND NICOLE M;;ABODE-IYAMAH KINGSLEY OTSIOREN;;STONER KIRSTEN E;;FLOUTY OLIVER ELIAS;;GUYMON C ALLAN;;GREEN BRIAN JAMES,,https://lens.org/091-762-358-541-672,Patent Application,yes,6,6,3,3,0,A61B17/8028;;A61B17/8061;;A61B17/8085;;A61F2002/30553;;A61F2002/30563;;A61F2002/30565;;A61F2002/30578;;A61F2002/30581;;A61F2002/30878;;A61F2002/30482;;A61F2/2875;;A61F2/30724;;A61F2002/30062;;A61B17/8028;;A61B17/8061;;A61B17/8085;;A61F2002/30878;;A61F2002/30553;;A61F2002/30563;;A61F2002/30482;;A61F2002/30565;;A61F2002/30581;;A61F2002/30578;;A61F2/2875;;A61F2/30724;;A61F2/30749;;A61F2002/30062;;A61F2002/30115,A61B17/00;;A61B17/56;;A61B17/58;;A61B17/68;;A61B17/80;;A61B17/88,,0,0,,,,PENDING
