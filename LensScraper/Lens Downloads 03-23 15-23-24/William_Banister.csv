Scalability of data replication is enhanced both by means of parallel queries as subtasks of a main controller, and by wrapping the queries in date time stamp-bounded ranges, requesting only records falling within the specific times indicated by the date time stamp. By wrapping the queries, the number of records per pass is limited, enhancing the efficiency of each pass. The reduced number of records per pass further facilitates re-initiation of data replication upon failure, because fewer records are less burdensome for a computing system to attempt to transmit and/or receive multiple times.
