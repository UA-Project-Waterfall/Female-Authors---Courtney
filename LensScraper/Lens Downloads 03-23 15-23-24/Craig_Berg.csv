The calibration control signal causes the actuator to rotate the first platform at least one complete rotation about the axis. The method also involves receiving encoder output signals. The encoder output signals are indicative of angular positions of the first platform about the axis. The method also involves receiving sensor output signals from an orientation sensor mounted on the first platform. The sensor output signals are indicative of a rate of change to an orientation of the orientation sensor. The method also involves determining calibration data based on given sensor output signals received from the orientation sensor during the at least one complete rotation. The calibration data is for mapping the encoder output signals to calibrated measurements of the angular positions of the first platform about the axis.,WAYMO LLC,ROBINSON CRAIG;;BERG ALEC,,https://lens.org/166-568-167-341-133,Patent Application,no,3,1,8,8,0,G01C25/005;;G01D18/001;;G01D18/00;;G01D18/001;;G01S17/931;;G01D18/001;;G01B7/22;;G01C19/00;;G01D5/145;;G01S13/931,G01D18/00;;G01D5/244,,0,0,,,,PENDING
