In some embodiments, the first and second satellites communicate with a respective number of ground terminals (e.g., gateway and user terminals) according to first and second satellite time slots, respectively. The satellites maintain relative positions in their orbital slot to manifest a maximum path delay difference between first and second path delays, the first path delay being between the first ground terminals and the first satellite, and the second path delay being between the first ground terminals and the second satellite. A synchronization system can offset the first satellite time slots from the second satellite time slots as a function of the maximum path delay difference.",VIASAT INC,BECKER DONALD W,VIASAT INC (2013-03-14),https://lens.org/021-345-599-319-70X,Patent Application,yes,6,48,2,2,0,H04B7/18513;;H04B7/2048;;H04B7/2125;;H04W56/0015;;H04W56/0015;;H04B7/18513;;H04B7/2125;;H04B7/2048,H04W56/00,370/326,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The timing offset is determined according to an analysis of the resampled data. The digitally sampled data burst is then resampled according to the timing estimation. Modulation of the resampled data burst is then removed by twice squaring the complex I Q pairs. The data with the modulation removed is then subjected to a Chirp Z Transform to move the data into the frequency domain. The highest spectral power is used to determine the frequency offset. The phase offset is determined and the resampled data burst is derotated and dephased according to the phase offset and the frequency offset.,TACHYON INC,BECKER DONALD W,,https://lens.org/120-841-869-440-350,Patent Application,no,0,0,10,52,0,G06F11/0757;;G06F11/1441;;H03J7/065;;H04B7/18582;;H04L7/0029;;H04L7/04;;H04L27/22;;H04L27/2276;;H04N21/235;;H04N21/23614;;H04N21/2385;;H04N21/4348;;H04N21/435;;H04N21/4381;;H04N21/6143;;H04N21/64322;;H04W80/06;;H04L69/16;;H04L69/166;;H04L69/161;;H04L69/163;;H04L69/168;;H04L27/227;;H04W80/06;;H04N21/64322;;H04N21/6143;;H04N21/4381;;H03J7/065;;H04L27/22;;H04L27/2276;;H04L7/04;;H04L7/0029;;G06F11/0757;;H04N21/23614;;H04N21/235;;H04N21/2385;;G06F11/1441;;H04N21/4348;;H04B7/18582;;H04N21/435;;H04L69/166;;H04L69/08;;H04L69/168;;H04L69/16;;H04L69/161;;H04L69/163;;H04L9/40,G06F11/00;;G06F11/14;;H03J7/06;;H04B7/165;;H04B7/185;;H04L7/00;;H04L7/04;;H04L12/56;;H04L27/22;;H04L27/227;;H04L29/06;;H04N21/235;;H04N21/236;;H04N21/2385;;H04N21/434;;H04N21/435;;H04N21/438;;H04N21/61;;H04N21/643,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

[Also in Division E1] Boring apparatus comprises a percussion hammer 26, Fig. 1, engaging an anvil cap 29 mounted on a rigid tubular drill pipe 30 which carries an annular cutting bit 36, Fig. 2. Pipe 30, Fig. 4, has upper female and lower male end fittings with complementary tapered threads and supports tube 130 forming annular chamber 55. Ports and passages 63, 64 in fitting 61 and ports in the male fitting provide for interconnection of the chambers 55 of adjacent pipes when joined together by the threads. Fluid under pressure is supplied from pipe 96 down the chambers 55 into passages 47, 48 in the bit which has radial teeth 42 separated by tapered walls forming cutting edge 45. The bit cuts large pieces which are moved up the central bore of the drill string and out through pipe 89. The apparatus is mounted on a vehicle frame 12 which also carries apparatus for raising the pipe string. This latter apparatus consists of a ground engaging plate 100, Fig. 8, mounting hydraulic jacks 102 from the piston rods 104 of which hangs a cradle 108, 109 carrying plates 110. Both plates have aligned holes through which pipe 30 extends. Arms 111 secure the apparatus to the frame 12. When it is required to raise the string, slips 116 are applied to the pipe in the hole in plate 110 which is then raised by jacks 102 to lift the string. When the string is otherwise supported, the jacks are retracted.

A robotically operated pick-up module has a frame-like structure with windows, admits these carriers individually into these windows, and clamps them within these windows by means of an actuator-controlled clamping member. After they are brought to a transfer station having seats with openings connected to a negative pressure source, their holding pieces are pushed apart by activating another actuator within the module so as to move claw-like unlatching members. The ICs, which are then placed on the seats of the transfer station and released from their carriers, are picked up by vacuum suction pipes connected to vacuum pumps.

A request is sent in a request signal space where the request represents a code sequence that is a member of a set of code sequences. Each member is characterized by an autocorrelation function that has a peak centered at zero time offset. Each member is further characterized by a cross correlation function. The cross correlation function has a low correlation window having a width and surrounding a zero time offset. An assignment is received that assigns the request to a transmission opportunity in a scheduled transmission signal space. The assignment is made in response to detecting the code sequence from receiving multiple requests having relative timing offsets less than the width of the low correlation window.

A ground processing unit in a geostationary satellite network can monitor the location of a coverage area of a narrowly directed beam and can detect a triggering factor of the beam displacement indicating the current displacement of one or more coverage areas. Ground terminals can be identified as being served by narrowly directed beams related to the displacement area(s), and as being affected by the displacement effect on the signal quality. A ground terminal unit can calculate an update of a beam assignment map containing the reassignment of identified user terminals from narrowly directed beams serving them at the current time to other narrowly directed beams to try to eliminate at least some effect on the signal quality identified as related to the displacement. In some embodiments, load balancing and/or other factors are additionally taken into account and/or a state-preserving connection between reassigned user terminals and the geostationary satellite can be maintained.EFFECT: maintaining the quality of service of ground terminals in the context of coverage area displacement by detecting signal quality deterioration resulting from such displacement and dynamically reassigning ground terminals to narrowly directed beams in a way that counteracts this deterioration.27 cl, 8 dwg",VIASAT INC,BECKER DONALD;;PETRANOVICH JAMES;;MARTIN REMBERTO,,https://lens.org/138-215-958-012-409,Granted Patent,no,6,0,38,38,0,H04B7/18541;;H04B7/19;;H04B7/2041;;H04B7/2041;;H04B17/309;;H04B7/18515;;H04B7/18541;;H04B7/18543;;H04B7/19;;H04B7/0408;;H04B7/18541;;H04B7/19;;H04B7/2041;;H04B7/18515;;H04B7/18541;;H04B7/19;;H04B7/2041;;H04B17/309;;H04B7/0408;;H04B7/18515;;H04B7/18541;;H04B7/18543;;H04B7/19;;H04B7/2041,H04B7/185,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

   When an installed wireless remote unit is operating in the field, routine operation is interrupted to enter a calibration mode. In calibration mode, the compression point of a circuit element is determined by applying a series of different drive levels to the circuit element. Based upon the determination of the compression point, a maximum transmission point is selected for the remote unit. Upon resumption of normal operation, the remote unit uses the maximum transmission point to limit the signal power level transmitted over the wireless link. As time passes or operating conditions change, the calibration process is re-executed.

A first sampler operates at a preselected fixed sampling rate asynchronous with the baseband component to produce a first sampler output. A controllable digital filter resamples the first sampler output to produce a filter output with a selectable resampling rate. The resampled output is time-position locked to the baseband signal epochs. The second sampling is processed to ascertain the symbol bit stream of the baseband signal. The controllable filter sampling rate is automatically varied to correspond to the symbol rate of the baseband signal, so that the sampling rate of the first sampler need not change. Initial signal acquisition is achieved by operating the receiver as a frequency spectrum analyzer. A single signal-carrying band is identified and demodulated, and a menu carried on a transport layer is read. This menu provides the center frequencies and bandwidths For all of the signals within an available frequency range, so that the receiver can be reconfigured for any desired signal. Changes in transmission characteristics of the signal can later be accommodated seamlessly by reading a change notice transmitted in the transport layer and reconfiguring the receiver for the new transmission characteristics.",TV COM TECH INC;;HYUNDAI ELECTRONICS AMERICA,BECKER DONALD W;;HARRIS FRED;;TIERNAN JAMES C,HYUNDAI ELECTRONICS AMERICA (1995-06-16);;LSI LOGIC CORPORATION (2002-08-26);;TV/COM TECHNOLOGIES INC (1995-07-12),https://lens.org/198-832-578-683-315,Granted Patent,yes,14,65,22,22,0,H04L7/0029;;H04L7/0029,H04L7/00;;H04L7/02;;H04L7/033;;H04L27/38;;H04L27/22,375/344;;375/350;;375/364;;375/269,17,7,017-189-620-279-137;;019-046-670-657-444;;030-914-067-153-60X;;085-377-102-472-425;;069-197-484-308-71X;;074-491-731-421-92X;;081-067-104-580-703,10.1109/26.221081;;10.1109/acssc.1989.1200838;;10.1109/iscas.1991.176115;;10.1109/acssc.1992.269110;;10.1109/icassp.1993.319127;;10.1109/ntc.1992.267869;;10.1109/acssc.1992.269196,"Floyd M.

A first sampler (46) operates at a preselected fixed asynchronous sampling rate on the baseband component to produce a first sampler output (48). A controllable digital filter (50) resamples the first sampler output to produce a filter output with a selectable resampling rate. The resampled output is time-position locked to baseband signal epochs. The resampling is processed to ascertain the bit stream of the baseband signal. The controllable filter sampling rate is automatically varied to correspond to the data rate of the baseband signal, so that the sampling rate of the first sampler need not change. Initial signal acquisition is achieved by operating the receiver as a frequency spectrum analyzer. A single signal-carrying band (66) is identified and demodulated, and a menu (72) carried on a transport layer (68) is read. This menu provides the center frequencies and bandwiths for all of the signals within an available frequency range, so that the receiver can be reconfigured for any desired signal. Changes in transmission characteristics of the signal can later be accommodated seamlessly by leading a change notice (74) transmitted in the transport layer and reconfiguring the receiver for the new transmission characteristics.",TV COM TECH INC,BECKER DONALD W;;HARRIS FRED;;TIERNAN JAMES C,,https://lens.org/182-564-819-659-350,Patent Application,no,0,0,22,22,0,H04L7/0029;;H04L7/0029,H04L27/38;;H04L7/00;;H04L7/02;;H04L7/033;;H04L27/22,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

In the extraction zone, the oleaginous seed material is subjected to concurrent contact with a carbohydrate-selective extraction solvent in a plurality of extraction vessels arranged in countercurrent fluid relationship therebetween with the expression of treated solids being effected after each extraction. The expressed solids from the last extracting vessel are passed to a desolventizing zone wherein residual solvent is vaporized by the respective indirect and direct contact with a heat transfer medium, such as steam, to produce a protein concentrate having a concentration (moisture free basis) of proteinaceous matter of at least about 70% by weight (6.25 times the total nitrogen content by the Kjeldahl method). The miscella is passed to a miscella treating zone which includes fractionating columns operating at different pressure levels in a multiple effect type of distillation system. The miscella is first introduced into a low pressure fractionating column and passed in indirect heat transfer relationship with the gaseous overhead from a second fractionating column to evaporate a portion of the extraction solvent. The bottoms from the low pressure fractionating column are then passed to the second fractionating column operating at a higher pressure and are passed in direct heat transfer relationship with steam and reboiled vapors to evaporate substantially all of the remaining portions of the extraction solvent with the liquid bottoms or whey being withdrawn for further processing.",DRAVO CORP,BECKER KENNETH W;;BACZEWSKI KLEMENS C;;KLEIN DONALD J,DAVY MCKEE CORPORATION A DE CORP (1988-09-30);;DRAVO ENGINEERING COMPANIES INC.

For example, the beam group switching pattern can be formulated to minimize worst-case degradation of capacity across user beams, to prioritize certain beams or beam groups, etc.",VIASAT INC,O'NEILL JOHN HAI;;BECKER DONALD W;;MILLER MARK J,VIASAT INC (2013-05-17),https://lens.org/022-376-906-500-903,Granted Patent,yes,58,0,13,13,0,H04B7/18515;;H04B7/18513;;H04W76/10;;H04B7/2041;;H04B7/18513;;H04W76/10;;H04B7/18515;;H04B7/2041;;H04W72/121;;H04W72/1263;;H04W88/16,H04B7/204;;H04B7/185;;H04W72/12;;H04W76/10;;H04W88/16,,59,9,109-925-672-299-461;;046-007-688-683-779;;167-830-098-453-189;;036-372-499-149-887;;161-606-679-637-74X;;031-169-225-844-481;;025-233-291-808-725;;134-610-383-671-773;;137-170-401-623-146,10.1109/milcom.2006.302154;;10.1049/ic:20000547;;10.1049/cp.2009.1154;;10.1109/milcom.2006.302118;;10.1002/j.1538-7305.1977.tb00576.x;;10.1109/past.2003.1256961;;10.1109/isqed.2002.996791;;10.1109/78.651228;;10.1109/milcom.2006.302229,"“Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) Technology: Spacecraft—Microwave Switch”, https://acts.grc.nasa.gov/technology/spacecraft/msm.shtml, retrieved on Jul. 27, 2012, 1 page.;;“Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) Technology: System Overview”, https://acts.grc.nasa.gov/technology/index.shtml, retrieved on Jul. 27, 2012, 2 pages.;;“Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS), Technology: Earth Stations”, https://acts.grc.nasa.gov/technology/earthstations/index.shtml, retrieved on Jul. 27, 2012, 2 pages.;;“Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS), Technology: Spacecraft—Adaptive Rain Fade”, https://acts.grc.nasa.gov/technology/spacecraft/rainfade.shtml, retrieved on Jul. 27, 2012, 2 pages.;;“Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS), Technology: Spacecraft—Multiple Hopping Beam”, https://acts.grc.nasa.gov/technologly/spacecraft/multihop.shtml, retrieved on Jul. 27, 2012, 2 pages.;;“Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS), Technology: Spacecraft—Specifications”, https://acts.grc.nasa.gov/technology/spacecraft/specs.shtml, retrieved on Jul. 27, 2012, 6 pages.;;Arnold et al “Mobile Communications In A Geosynchronous Regenerative Satellite Mesh (RSM) System”, Hughes Network Systems, 2006, 6 pages.;;Berk et al “On-Board Processing for Future Satellite Communications Systems: Comparison of FDM, TDM, and Hybrid Accessing Schemes”, MTR 8701, MITRE, Jun. 1982, 192 pages.;;Couchman et al “Defocused Array Fed Reflector Antennas for Ka”, Broad Band Satellites, 2005, 8 pages.;;EMS Technologies, Inc. , “Beam Forming Networks”, Application Note, Revision B, Aug. 2004, 36 pages.;;Franchi et al “Technology Trends and Maket Drivers for Broadband Mobile Via Satellite: Inmarsat BGAN,”, Inmarsat, 2001, 9 pages.;;Gedney et al “ACTS Technology Description and Results”, NASA/CR-2000-209806, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Glenn Research Center, Prepared under Contract NAS3-23790, Feb. 2000, 158 pages.;;Gedney et al “Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS)”, NASA Lewis Research Center, IEEE, 1989, pp. 1566-1577.;;Gopal, “Innovations in Satellite Networking Technology and Products”, SIA, Hughes, Dec. 7, 2006, 10 pages.;;Gopal et al “Regenerative Satellite Mesh System For Real-Time Multi-Party Multimedia Traffic”, Hughes Network Systems, LLC (HUGHES), 2009, 9 pages.;;Gopal et al “Technology Readiness of Future Generation Networks Leveraging Regenerative Satellite Mesh Architecture—A Spaceway Perspective”, Hughes Network Systems, LLC,, 2006, 7 pages.;;Hading ER et al “Next Generation High Capacity Ka-Band Satellite Systems”, Northrop Grumman Space Technology, 13th Ka and Broadband Communications Conference, Sep. 24-26, 2007, pp. 1-8.;;Intellect , “Satellite Provision of Next Generation Broadband Services in UK”, Prepared for the Broadband Stakeholder Group, Information Technology Telecommunications and Electronics Association, Oct. 29, 2007, pp. 1-27.;;Kitao et al “Proto-flight Model Development of the Multi-beam Active Phased Array Antenna for WINDS”, 2007, 4 pages.;;Krawclyk et al “The Advanced Communications Technology Satellite—Performance, Reliability and Lessons Learned”, NASA-Glenn Research Center, ACTS Conference Proceedings, 2000, pp. 175-184.;;Lowry et al “Advanced Communications Technology Satellite, System Handbook”, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA TM-101490, Revisions, Sep. 30, 1993, 126 pages.;;Mallison et al “Enabling Technologies for the Eurostar Geomobile Satellite”, 19th AIAA International Communications Satellite Systems Conference.

SOLUTION: In order to control required switching between different network access techniques, a network access arbitrator(NAA) provided with a virtual network adapter driver is positioned between the data link layer of a standard OSI7 layer protocol stack and a network layer. Since all network applications are controlled by the layers higher than the network layer, when switching the NAA between the different network access techniques, each of all applications to use a network service provided by the network layer continues its active network session or application without stop.",NORTEL NETWORKS LTD,WURCH DONALD L;;LE LIEM Q;;BECKER CAREY B;;QADDOURA EMAD A;;COFFIN RUSS C,,https://lens.org/044-957-905-970-739,Patent Application,no,1,10,14,32,0,H04L12/14;;H04L12/1403;;H04L12/145;;H04L12/1485;;H04L12/2863;;H04L41/0803;;H04L63/0272;;H04W8/26;;H04W80/04;;H04L67/306;;H04L69/18;;H04L69/324;;H04L69/325;;H04L69/329;;H04L61/45;;H04L61/5046;;H04L61/5007;;H04L61/5084;;H04L2101/604;;H04L2101/622;;H04L61/5014;;H04L67/53;;H04L67/52;;H04L69/322;;H04L12/28;;H04L69/322;;H04L69/325;;H04L69/329;;H04L69/324;;H04L63/0272;;H04L12/1403;;H04L12/145;;H04W80/04;;H04L12/14;;H04L41/0803;;H04W8/26;;H04L12/2863;;H04L12/1485;;H04L69/325;;H04L69/329;;H04L69/32;;H04L67/306;;H04L69/18;;H04L69/324;;H04L9/40;;H04L61/5007;;H04L61/5014;;H04L61/5046;;H04L61/5084;;H04L67/52;;H04L67/53;;H04L61/45;;H04L2101/604;;H04L2101/622,H04L12/14;;H04L12/24;;H04L12/28;;H04L29/06;;H04L29/08;;H04L29/12,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   Transducer probe identification is provided. A wireless identification is provided. For example, a radiofrequency identification tag is positioned within a transducer probe. A receiver is positioned within the imaging device. Using the wireless information, the imaging device may generate a list of available transducers regardless of whether they are connected with the imaging device. As an alternative or addition, information specific to a transducer is provided to the imaging device. Using either wireless transmission or a wired connection, the information distinguishes a given transducer from other transducers of a same type and manufacturer or from all other transducers. The specific identifier is then used with security information to prevent theft. For example, a code from the transducer probe is compared with a security code in a list on the imaging device, entered in response to a request generated once the transducer probe is connected to the imaging device, communicated from an adapter that connects with the transducer probe and the imaging device or other sources of security information. If the security information does not match the transducer code, the imaging device, the transducer probe or both may be disabled. Alternatively, a warning is displayed, such as This transducer probe is the property of Hospital.
