   A beverage can lid with an easy opening feature comprises a scored lid, having a pull tab affixed to the lid by a rivet and an initial contact point on the lid which is pushed downward as the score line breaks at the puncture point adjacent the rivet. In the invention, the contact point is positioned in close proximity to the rivet to minimize the required lifting force, which is in proportion to the distance between the initial contact point and the rivet. Further, the puncture point is positioned close to the initial contact point so that the lifting force is also reduced. In one embodiment, the scoring radius at the puncture point is quite sharp so that the force required to break the seal at the puncture point is reduced. Also the gap between the puncture point and the end of the scored line is minimized to facilitate opening the lid. Furthermore, the pivot line is moved closer to the contact point to reduce the lifting force. Additional savings result from minimizing the width and length of the pull-tab and using thinner gauge metal than customarily used in the prior art.

    A switch suitable for use in high-bandwidth environments is disclosed. The switch eliminates the need for inter-stage jitter compensation by determining the timing signals associated with each data input and then re-timing the data based upon the timing signals at the switch output. Bandwidth is conserved by routing timing signals through a multiplexer that preferably determines the difference between the timing signal and a reference signal, combines the difference signal with other difference signals calculated for other data inputs, and then transmits the multiplexed difference signals to a demultiplexer. Suitable multiplexing schemes include time division multiplexing, wavelength division multiplexing, code division multiple access (CDMA) multiplexing, as well as various combinations of suitable multiplexing methods.

A particular subarray module circuit board that is under test has its 180° main phase bit toggled between 0° and 180°. The radar (70) selects the output of that particular subarray module by Doppler filter type of software filtering. The amplitude of the in-phase and quadrature phase (71, 72) signals from the radar (70) is recorded. The binary digital signals that control subarray steering bits are set to a second setting. The 180° main phase bit of the module under test is again toggled between 0° and 180°. The output of the module under test is again selected by Doppler filter type of software filtering. The amplitude of the in-phase and quadrature phase signals from the radar (70) is recorded. The phase difference from the reference setting to the second setting is computed and compared with a predetermined threshold. If desired, the test source (69) may have a multi-element feed including multiple dipoles, each dipole having a radiation pattern wide enough to cover two rows of subarray modules, the test source (69) being switched to the particular one of the dipoles that illuminates the row including the module under test.",HUGHES AIRCRAFT COMPANY,"LUI, SIEN-CHANG CHARLES",RAYTHEON COMPANY (1999-01-13),https://lens.org/091-381-248-412-635,Search Report,yes,2,0,7,7,0,G01R29/10;;G01R29/10;;G01S7/4052;;G01S7/4052;;G01S7/4095;;G01S7/4095;;H01Q3/267;;H01Q3/267,G01R29/10;;H01Q3/26,,1,0,,,"PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN vol. 7, no. 4 (E-151)(1149) 8 January 1983 & JP-A-57 162 803 ( MITSUBISHI )",EXPIRED

   The invention provides a non-contact style temperature measurement device, which utilizes a memory to memorize preset temperatures of a plurality of objects to be measured and their infrared emission rates. These temperatures, such as suitable temperature of bathing water for babies, best temperature for roasting beef, best refrigeration temperature for vegetables, and temperature that can be tolerated by human's skin, are specific values that are hard for people to memorize them. Therefore, a memory is used for memorizing these values, and a selector is used for selecting appropriate values. Also, an input device is used to input any objects to be added in for measurement or to revise the inputted preset temperatures in order to increase the utilization rate, security, and convenience of the temperature measurement device so that the device can become a necessity of daily life.

The applicator has an elongate, tubular body with an inner chamber for storing a chemical formulation or substance such as an exfoliant, to be applied to the lips. One end of the body has an external, oblique, lip-engageable abrasive applicator surface containing a product-dispensing orifice through which the substance can be ejected. Such ejection is accomplished by means of a finger-engageable wheel that is turned to forcibly discharge the substance through the orifices and onto the applicator surface. Thereafter this surface which now contains the discharged substance, is rubbed against the lips and thus effects a scrubbing thereof, which brings about gentle and controlled exfoliation of accumulated dead skin cells. Following this, excess dead cell material can be wiped off with a tissue or pad. The opposite end of the body is provided with a similar external, oblique, lip-engageable applicator surface also having a textured or abrasive surface configuration, whereby following the user's scrubbing or gently exfoliating the lips from the first noted abrasive surface, the applicator body can be reversed and the second applicator surface utilized to polish the lips and thus impart a smooth appearance or characteristic thereto. The advantage of the invention is that both a moderately coarse scrubbing and a gentler, polishing effect can be achieved by the use of the same applicator instrument. And, the applicator is especially compact and easy to use.",ENG SERENA;;CHANG CHARLES,ENG SERENA;;CHANG CHARLES,TOPLINE PRODUCTS COMPANY INC (2016-01-29);;CHANG CHARLES (2006-12-11),https://lens.org/058-217-160-812-780,Patent Application,yes,5,23,2,2,0,A45D34/04;;A45D40/04;;A45D40/24;;A45D2200/055;;A45D2200/1018;;A45D2200/1054;;A45D34/04;;A45D40/04;;A45D2200/1018;;A45D2200/1054;;A45D40/24;;A45D2200/055,B05C11/00;;A47L13/26;;B43K1/06,401/37;;401/266;;401/265,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

    An improved flip-flop circuit exhibits a higher phase margin than conventional flip-flop circuits without a substantial increase in operating power. The flip-flop circuit includes a master latch circuit operatively coupled to a slave latch circuit. The flip-flop circuit uses any number of techniques to delay the hold-to-sample transition of the slave latch circuit relative to the sample-to-hold transition of the master latch circuit. The delay enables the flip-flop circuit to better tolerate clock/data timing alignment issues. In a first embodiment, the slave clock signal is delayed relative to the master clock signal. In a second embodiment, the master clock signal buffer is unbalanced such that its duty cycle is skewed to produce unequal sample and hold periods. In a third embodiment, the master latch circuit is unbalanced to create an unequal delay associated with the sampling and holding periods.

Without such protection a conventional rock fall protection fence frequently fails upon impact from large falling rocks spinning at a high angular velocity and with an immense momentum, as demonstrated in many rock fall-induced fence failures. CNC/ILDS sleeves embrace a cable or post to deflect falling rocks spinning at a high angular velocity and associated impact forces and, thereby, protect them by avoiding detrimental blows from the falling rocks. The RC (removable collar) is used when two different-size CNC/ILDS sleeves are used. This is to avoid a smaller sleeve from slipping into a larger one and to assure the protection that CNC/ILDS sleeve is designed for. Additionally, the RC collar also enhances the constructability and eases the maintenance of a rock fall mitigation fence system.

When the paper roll is at full size, the center of gravity is on the guide tracks; when the paper roll gets smaller, the center of gravity shifts closer to the roller ensuring that the paper roll is fed constantly thereby increasing motor efficiency.",OSBORNE CHARLES AGNEW;;CHANG TSU LING,OSBORNE CHARLES AGNEW;;CHANG TSU LING,,https://lens.org/030-411-687-165-447,Granted Patent,no,0,0,12,12,0,A47K10/36;;B65H16/005;;B65H16/106;;B65H2551/185;;A47K2010/3668;;A47K10/3618;;A47K10/3625;;B65H2551/21;;B65H16/106;;A47K10/36;;B65H2551/185;;B65H16/005;;A47K10/3625;;A47K2010/3668;;A47K10/3618;;B65H2551/21,A47K10/36;;B65H16/10,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

First, a prompt request command is transmited to the fault insertion circuit from the data terminal. The fault insertion circuit receives the prompt request command and transmits to the data terminal a hardware fault response character if a hardware fault has been detected, or a configuration status response character. An insertion command and fault instruction data is transmitted to the fault insertion circuit from the data terminal in response to the configuration status response character. The fault insertion circuit receives the insertion command and fault instruction data and ascertains if the insertion command and the data instruction are valid. If the command or the instruction are invalid, then an appropriate invalid command response character is transmitted to the data terminal. When the insertion command and instruction data are valid, the fault insertion circuit induces a fault to the digital circuit under test in accordance with the parameters of the data instruction. Finally, a completed response character is transmitted to the data terminal from the fault insertion circuit when the insertion command is successfully completed. 17",AG COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS,NAMITZ WALTER J;;CHANG CHARLES S,,https://lens.org/143-220-101-830-864,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,,G01R31/28,D432400581   M,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

    Modern fiber optic networks typically transfer data using encoding in which the clock is transmitted along with the data, for example in NRZ format. In order to use the clock to process the data, the clock signal must be extracted from the data signal. Because the data and clock may travel through different circuit paths they may have different propagation delays and a phase offset between the clock and data may result. Data and clock phase offsets are more problematical as data transmission speed increases. Furthermore the data/phase offset is typically not constant and may change with a variety of variables. To compensate for the changing offset, one or more variable delays are inserted in the phase detector circuitry. The timing of the variable delay is controlled by a bang-bang phase detector, such as an Alexander phase detector, which determines if the clock is leading, lagging, or in phase with the data. The delay control loops are low bandwidth, because the phase offset generally changes slowly, and because the loops should not respond to temporary upsets such as noise spikes. The delay control loops integrate the output of the bang-bang phase detector and use the output to control a decimated up down counter, which is then further used to control one or more variable delays. The counter can be pre-loaded with a default start point, and the bandwidth of the loops can be dynamically adjusted by changing the decimation ratio and sample periods of the loop.

Without such protection a conventional rock fall protection fence frequently fails upon impact from large falling rocks spinning at a high angular velocity and with an immense momentum, as demonstrated in many rock fall-induced fence failures. CNC/ILDS sleeves embrace a cable or post to deflect falling rocks spinning at a high angular velocity and associated impact forces and, thereby, protect them by avoiding detrimental blows from the falling rocks. The RC (removable collar) is used when two different-size CNC/ILDS sleeves are used. This is to avoid a smaller sleeve from slipping into a larger one and to assure the protection that CNC/ILDS sleeve is designed for. Additionally, the RC collar also enhances the constructability and eases the maintenance of a rock fall mitigation fence system.

At least one bi-directional power converter may be coupled directly to the variable frequency AC bus and adapted to convert the variable frequency AC raw power to a fully regulated adjustable-frequency and adjustable-voltage power to control AC motors and other high performance variable frequency AC loads. A bi-directional power converter is coupled directly to the variable frequency AC bus and adapted to convert the variable frequency AC power generated by the alternator into constant frequency AC power. At least one constant frequency AC load is coupled to a constant frequency AC bus which is in turn coupled between the constant frequency AC load and the bi-directional power converter. A first bi-directional power bus controller is coupled between the bi-directional power converter and the constant frequency AC bus. The system further comprises an AC/DC bi-directional power converter coupled to a DC bus and at least one DC load coupled thereto. A second bi-directional power bus controller is coupled between the AC/DC power converter and the DC bus. The first and second bi-directional controllers provide for the selective and automatic reconfiguration of the flow of power through the system. A novel high-level subsystem interconnection architecture is also disclosed.

According to one aspect of the invention, for a selected sampling phase and a decision threshold, high BER values are measured. Low BER values are approximated from the high BER values using error functions. The procedures are repeated for all selected sampling phases and decision thresholds and corresponding BER values are calculated. The sampling phases and decision thresholds for each specific BER value are plotted to create the BER contour diagrams. The optimum decision threshold for a sampling phase is calculated by equating the BER due to marks (“ 1 s”) and the BER due to spaces (“ 0 s”).

    As the recording density of magnetic disk drives approaches 100 Gbits/in ^{ 2 } , write track lengths of about 0.10 microns will be required. This cannot be accomplished using conventional photolithography. The present invention solves this problem by first forming on the bottom pole of the write head a cavity in a layer of photoresist, using conventional means. A seed layer of non-magnetic material is electrolessly laid down, following which a second layer of photoresist is deposited and patterned to form a second cavity that symmetrically surrounds the first one, thereby forming a mold around it. Ferromagnetic metal is then electro-deposited in this mold to form the top magnetic pole. Following the removal of all photoresist and a brief selective etch of the bottom pole, an extremely narrow write head is obtained.

For IGTs, parasitic thyristor action is reduced.",GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY,"CHANG, MIKE FU-SHING;;PIFER, GEORGE CHARLES","HARRIS CORPORATION TE MELBOURNE, FLORIDA, VER. ST.

    As the recording density of magnetic disk drives approaches 100 Gbits/in ² , write track lengths of about 0.10 microns will be required. This cannot be accomplished using conventional photolithography. The present invention solves this problem by first forming on the bottom pole of the write head a cavity in a layer of photoresist, using conventional means. A seed layer of non-magnetic material is electrolessly laid down, following which a second layer of photoresist is deposited and patterned to form a second cavity that symmetrically surrounds the first one, thereby forming a mold around it. Ferromagnetic metal is then electro-deposited in this mold to form the top magnetic pole. Following the removal of all photoresist and a brief selective etch of the bottom pole, an extremely narrow write head is obtained.

   A wireless communication system and method for controlling transmission power to maintain a received signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) as close as possible to a target SIR. A received quality is maintained as close as possible to a target quality based on block error rate (BLER). When a target BLER is converted to an initial target SIR, an error may occur due to a channel condition mismatch, since the target SIR required for the target BLER varies with channel conditions. An outer loop power control process is used to set a target SIR for each coded composite transport channel (CCTrCH) based on the required target BLER. The process adjusts a SIR step size parameter to maximize the convergence speed of the process.

A received quality is maintained as close as possible to a target quality based on block error rate (BLER).

The base and base shield include complementary locking surfaces sized and positioned so that only when at a higher temperature will the locking surfaces be opposite one another to prevent removal of the base shield from the base. This eliminates the need for mechanical locking elements, such as threads, pins or twist locks, which increase the cost and can be a source of particle contamination.",APPLIED MATERIALS INC,ZHAO JUN;;CHANG FRANK P;;DORNFEST CHARLES N,APPLIED MATERIALS INC.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION. Dec. 23, 1964 [Jan. 13, 1964], No. 52303/64. Heading H3B. [Also in Division H1] In a magnetic uniaxial film element store in which information is stored by magnetizing the film along one direction or the other along the easy axis, the film element having an associated range or associated ranges of values of magnetization along the hard axis variation within which can cause, by a creeping action, the switching or destruction of the stored information, the element is subjected to a disturb magnetic field which acts along the hard axis and varies within the range or a range and a bias magnetic field along the hard axis, the resultant of the bias and disturbs fields lying outside the associated range or ranges. It is stated that wall creeping is produced in both thick and thin magnetic films when the films are subjected to alternating fields in the hard direction of value 0À2 H K to 0À3 H K for thick films and 0À3 H K to 0 for thin films, Figs. 3, 4 (not shown). Since in word orientated memory systems the word field in a selected word or line can produce a strong disturb field in the hard direction in the elements of lines adjacent to the selected word these elements may be switched. In accordance with the invention an electrical conductor or strip 50 is disposed over ground plane 12À1 to cover the film elements 10 and the current therethrough from battery 56 is adjusted by resistor 54 so as to provide a magnetic field 32À1 in the hard direction and having a value at least 0À2 H K but not greater than 0À3 H K . Storage in the film is by passing a current of the appropriate polarity through the selected word line 18À1, 18À2, 18À3 coincidently with a current through the selected bit conductor 16À1, 16À2, 16À3. Read-out is by energization of the selected word line 18 such that the field produced thereby is less than H K to enable non-destructive read-out. When thin films are employed the bias field must be in the direction of the disturb fields which is possible in the application of the invention to a magnetic store since a unipolar word drive pulse is employed. If thick films are employed, i.e. greater than 900 Angstroms, the hard axis bias field may be in or against the direction of the disturb fields provided the disturb fields are approximately 0À6 H K . Random fields may be eliminated by shielding. In the arrangement of Fig. 6 (not shown) the strip conductor of Fig. 5 is replaced by a Helmholtz coil arrangement. The bit and drive lines need not be orthogonal.",IBM,CHANG HSU;;MEE CHARLES DENIS;;MIDDELHOEK SIMON;;VOEGELL OTTO,,https://lens.org/143-913-493-285-667,Granted Patent,no,0,0,8,9,0,G11C7/02;;G11C11/14;;G11C11/15;;H01F10/30;;G11C11/15;;H01F10/30;;G11C7/02;;G11C11/14,G11C7/02;;G11C11/14;;G11C11/15;;H01F10/30,H1T T7A3          -;;H1T T7A9          -;;H1T T7C2          -;;H3B B200          CC;;H3B B202          CC;;H3B B203          CC;;H3B B204          CC;;H3B B205          CC;;H3B B210          CC;;H3B B231          CC;;H3B B232          CC;;H3B B236          CC;;H3B B237          CC;;H3B B277          CC;;H3B B303          CC;;H3B B304          CC;;H3B B331          CC;;H3B B332          CC;;H3B B339          CC;;H3B B350          CC;;H3B B376          CC;;H3B B390          CC;;H3B B391          CC;;H3B B393          CC;;H3B B395          CC;;H3B B404          CC;;H3B B413          CC;;H3B B416          CC;;H3B B418          CC;;H3B B460          CC;;H3B B465          CC;;H3B B473          CC;;H3B B474          CC;;H3B B491          CC;;H3X X5A           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The height, diameter, and separation of the structured pillars are preferably on the nanometer scale and, hence, electrodes comprising the pillars are identified as nanostructured pillar electrodes. The nanostructured pillars may be formed, for example, by deposition into or etching through a surface template using standard lithography processes. Structured pillar electrodes offer a number of advantages when incorporated into optoelectronic devices such as photovoltaic cells. These include improved charge collection efficiency via a reduction in the carrier transport distance and an increase in electrode-photoactive layer interface surface area.

The reaction mixture contains sources of silica, soda, alumina and trace amounts of Q ions as nucleation agents. Because the crystallites as synthesized from the aqueous medium exhibit only a very small fraction of blocking cations, there is always a diffusion path for the hydrated sodium ions to be exchanged without the need of prior removal of the blocking cations by calcination or otherwise. The small size crystallites can be exchanged, blended with matrix material, and formed into catalyst particles. The silica to alumina ratio can be varied and when no aluminum is added, silicalite may be formed.

The pre-mixing space communicates with different ink storage spaces through a plurality of providing elements, then the volume of different colored inks is controlled by means of the ink providing elements to be injected into the pre-mixing space. The desired color level ink is created in the pre-mixing space in advance. Finally, the desired color level pre-mixed ink is jected onto the recording media (such as paper or other similar material) through an inkjet printing driver at the pre-mixing space. Therefore, the desired color level can be produced by only one inkjet printing at any printing area, which will be extremely beneficial for increasing the speed of inkjet printing.

The pre-mixing space communicates with different ink storage spaces through a plurality of providing elements, then the volume of different colored inks is controlled by the ink providing elements to be injected into the pre-mixing space. The desired color level ink is created in the pre-mixing space in advance. Finally, the desired color level pre-mixed ink is ejected onto the recording media (such as paper or other similar material) through an inkjet printing driver at the pre-mixing space. Therefore, the desired color level can be produced by only one inkjet printing at any printing area, which will be extremely beneficial for increasing the speed of inkjet printing.

Noise generated by analog-to-digital converters is filtered from a pixel of digital image data. Moreover, the effects of single pixel defects in the imager are eliminated by clamping a predetermined pixel of image data within the window when the value of the predetermined pixel is greater than a maximum value of the image data of neighboring pixels or less than a minimum value of the image data of neighboring pixels. Ripples in image data are reduced by eliminating the effects of single pixel defects before filtering for crosstalk caused by electrical crosstalk between sensor elements in an imager. Dark current is removed from image data generated by an imager by subtracting a fraction of a determined dark current value from all image data generated by the imager to compensate for nonlinearities in dark current across the imager. The image data is white balanced by creating a set of scalar color adjustments from determined average color values and constraining the set of scalar adjustments to plausible lighting conditions to prevent overcompensation on images having large regions of similar hue. Lastly, utilization of a fixed set of intensity levels is optimized by remapping and restreching the image data to create new luma values for each pixel.",SENSATA TECHNOLOGIES INC,SODINI CHARLES G;;SPROUL JASON Y;;CHANG EDWARD T,SMAL CAMERA TECHNOLOGIES (2004-02-27),https://lens.org/068-953-737-922-860,Granted Patent,yes,3,80,1,1,0,G06T5/40;;H04N5/21;;H04N23/71;;H04N23/73;;H04N25/575;;H04N25/63;;H04N25/683;;H04N25/76;;H04N23/88;;G06T5/92;;G06T5/40;;H04N5/21;;H04N23/71;;H04N23/73;;H04N23/88;;H04N25/63;;H04N25/76;;H04N25/575;;H04N25/683;;G06T5/92,G06K9/00,382/168;;345/589,3,1,009-406-602-689-659,10.1109/4.735551,"""A 256x256 CMOS Imaging Array with Side Dynamic Range Pixels and Column-Parallel Digital Output,"" Decker et al.

The optical components of the network can transport vast amounts of information, while the ATM-based electronics provides data processing, and information distribution. The capacity of the communications network to reconfigure and rearrange itself is maximized through wavelength translation of its data signals using a limited set of fixed-wavelength channels. The system incorporates an optical fiber communication network ring, or several optical fiber communication network rings that are connected to each other, through which data signals are transmitted and received. Optical WDM cross-connecting switch devices 4a-4e connect adjacent optical fiber rings 3a, 3b to each other, and control the routing of the data signals into and out of the optical fiber rings 3a, 3b. Access node circuits 2a-2d connected to the WDM cross-connecting switch devices 4a-4d can access the data signals in the optical fiber rings 3a, 3b.

Because the crystallites as synthesized from the aqueous medium exhibit only a small fraction of blocking cations, there is always a diffusion path for the hydrated sodium ions to be exchanged without the need of prior removal of the blocking cations by calcination or otherwise.

    A pressure control device for regulating the ink pressure of a multi-reservoir ink cartridge. The pressure regulator employs an external spring or springs plate assembly mounted between two neighboring ink reservoirs. The external surfaces of the spring or assembly are attached to the respective side face of the reservoirs. Each ink reservoir has at least a side face formed from a flexible non-elastic material. When all of the ink reservoirs are full, the spring or assembly is in a relaxed state. By withdrawing a small quantity of ink from each ink reservoir, atmospheric pressure exerts forces on the ink reservoirs leading to a small contraction. The resulting distortion of the spring or assembly produces a force that resists further contraction of the reservoirs. Since the pressures inside the reservoirs are smaller than external atmospheric pressure, a back-pressure that prevents any leakage of ink from the reservoirs is created. In addition, a pressure plate can be added to the spring means to squeeze the ink out of the reservoir more evenly.

The laser chip can thus be held by a manufacturing tool, such that the manufacturing tool abuts the pads without abutting the ridge structure. In this manner, the ridge structure of the laser is protected from damage due to contacts by manufacturing tools, increasing the device yield of a wafer. By providing the pads only on the non-active areas of the junction surface, parasitic capacitance for contacts in the active areas can be properly controlled.

The reaction mixture contains sources of silica, soda, alumina and trace amounts of Q ions as nucleation agents. Because the crystallites as synthesized from the aqueous medium exhibit only a very small fraction of blocking cations, there is always a diffusion path for the hydrated sodium ions to be exchanged without the need of prior removal of the blocking cations by calcination or otherwise. The small size crystallites can be exchanged. blended with matrix material, and formed into catalyst particles. The silcia to alumina ratio can be varied and when no aluminium is added, silicalite may be formed.
