Describe herein is a mouse model for AVM that includes a viable, postnatal animal with a conditional deletion of the activin receptor-like kinase 1 (Alkl;Acvrll). The Alkl-cKO mouse model can be used to identify genes and gene products that are upregulated in subjects suffering from AVM. For example, it has been discovered Agpt2, ILip, and TNF-a, are upregulated in Alkl-cKO compared to controls. Pharmaceutical compositions for treatment of AVM are disclosed.

Describe herein is a mouse model for AVM that includes a viable, postnatal animal with a conditional deletion of the activin receptor-like kinase 1 (Alk1;Acvrl1). The Alk1-cKO mouse model can be used to identify genes and gene products that are upregulated in subjects suffering from AVM. For example, it has been discovered Agpt2, IL1β, and TNF-α, are upregulated in Alk1-cKO compared to controls. Pharmaceutical compositions for treatment of AVM are disclosed.
