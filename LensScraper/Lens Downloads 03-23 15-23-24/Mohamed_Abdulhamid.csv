In another aspect, the present invention relates to a reactor system for fluidic catalytic cracking comprising (a) at least one fluidic catalytic cracking process unit (FCCU)  3 , wherein the FCCU  3  is a arranged such that a first hydrocarbon stream  1  comprising a petroleum feedstock can be fed into the FCCU  3 , (b) at least one C 4 -hydrocarbons preparation unit  6  producing a second hydrocarbon stream  2  comprising an oxygenate, wherein the reactor system is arranged such that the second hydrocarbon stream  2  can be passed from the at least one C 4 -hydrocarbons preparation unit  6  to the at least one FCCU  3 . In a third aspect, the present invention relates to use of a process or reactor system according to any one of the preceding claims for producing one or more hydrocarbon product streams  4 . Thus, the process, reactor system and use according to the present invention provide for the conversion of an acetone rich naphtha stream to olefins and, thus, for reducing the negative impact of acetone on the chemical grade naphtha specifications while at the same time reaction conditions efficient for both oxygenate-to-olefin conversions and fluid catalytic cracking are provided.
