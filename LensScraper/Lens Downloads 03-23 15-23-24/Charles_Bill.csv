The system and method utilizes a plurality of seismic energy sources that are located at known positions at the surface of the earth. The seismic energy sources generate seismic signals that propagate downward into the earth. Some of the seismic signals are reflected and diffracted by various sub-surface layers and are returned to the surface of the earth. The returned seismic signals are received by a plurality of receivers. The method includes the step of determining the distance from an energy source to an image point. A fast travel time of the seismic signal from the energy source to the image point is determined, and a slow travel time of the seismic signal from the energy source to the image point is determined. The azimuth angle between the energy source and the surface location of the image point is calculated. A first travel time of the seismic signal traveling from the energy source to the image point is calculated. A second travel time of the seismic signal traveling from the image point to the seismic receiver is calculated. The total travel time is calculated by adding the first and second travel time. The amplitudes from the recorded signal at the total travel time are phase adjusted and added into the output image at the image point.

The system and method utilizes a plurality of seismic energy sources that are located at known positions at the surface of the earth. The seismic energy sources generate seismic signals that propagate downward into the earth. Some of the seismic signals are reflected and diffracted by various sub-surface layers and are returned to the surface of the earth. The returned seismic signals are received by a plurality of receivers. The method includes the step of determining the distance from an energy source to an image point. A fast travel time of the seismic signal from the energy source to the image point is determined, and a slow travel time of the seismic signal from the energy source to the image point is determined. The azimuth angle between the energy source and the surface location of the image point is calculated. A first travel time of the seismic signal traveling from the energy source to the image point is calculated. A second travel time of the seismic signal traveling from the image point to the seismic receiver is calculated. The total travel time is calculated by adding the first and second travel time. The amplitudes from the recorded signal at the total travel time are phase adjusted and added into the output image at the image point. The foregoing steps are repeated for a plurality of image points beneath the surface of the earth and the total travel time is calculated.",WEINMAN GEOSCIENCE,SICKING CHARLES;;NELAN STUART;;MCLAIN WILLIAM BILL H,GEOPHYSICAL TECHNOLOGY INC (2022-10-26);;WEINMAN GEOSCIENCE (2007-01-28);;GLOBAL GEOPHYSICAL SERVICES INC (2008-06-04),https://lens.org/161-080-896-027-020,Granted Patent,yes,15,5,3,3,0,G01V1/28;;G01V2210/51;;G01V1/28;;G01V2210/51,G01V1/22;;G01V1/28,367/38;;367/50;;367/51;;367/57,2,1,020-554-277-472-554,10.1190/1.1820499,"Castonguya et al.

The latter pick-up derives a one times per revolution reference signal which is treated by a software driven process control system including dual timer-counters to evaluate the period of revolution, T, and to develop N incremental sampling pulses having a duration or time constant of T/N. Preferably, N is an even integer power of 2. Periodic updating of the duration of a time constant is developed utilizing only one software interrupt in conjunction with the two counter timers. A nulling technique for canceling offset at the signal treatment stages is provided which accommodates for the high amplification levels necessary at the front end of the system.

The system and method utilizes a plurality of seismic energy sources that are located at known positions at the surface of the earth. The seismic energy sources generate seismic signals that propagate downward into the earth. Some of the seismic signals are reflected and diffracted by various sub-surface layers and are returned to the surface of the earth. The returned seismic signals are received by a plurality of receivers. The method includes the step of determining the distance from an energy source to an image point. A fast travel time of the seismic signal from the energy source to the image point is determined, and a slow travel time of the seismic signal from the energy source to the image point is determined. The azimuth angle between the energy source and the surface location of the image point is calculated. A first travel time of the seismic signal traveling from the energy source to the image point is calculated. A second travel time of the seismic signal traveling from the image point to the seismic receiver is calculated. The total travel time is calculated by adding the first and second travel time. The amplitudes from the recorded signal at the total travel time are phase adjusted and added into the output image at the image point. The foregoing steps are repeated for a plurality of image points beneath the surface of the earth and the total travel time is calculated.",WEINMAN GEOSCIENCE,SICKING CHARLES;;NELAN STUART;;MCLAIN WILLIAM H BILL,WEINMAN GEOSCIENCE (2007-01-08),https://lens.org/179-316-101-185-968,Patent Application,yes,0,4,3,3,0,G01V1/28;;G01V2210/51;;G01V1/28;;G01V2210/51,G01V1/28,367/53,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

CONSTITUTION: An amplifying system(100) amplifies the input signals inputted to the amplifying system via a line(101), and output signals amplified via a line(103) are outputted. The system is composed of an amplifier(102), a control system(104), and a pre distorter(105). Herein, the input signal on the line is a received CDMA(Code Division Multiple Access) signal. The received signal has a previously informed bandwidth(BW), but a carrier frequency(fc) of the received signal becomes one among multiple carrier frequencies and the carrier frequency is informed previously. A non-linear amplification by the amplifier induces the amplitude and phase distortion elements to the amplified output signals.

   A non-metallic element system is provided which can effectively seal or pack-off an annulus under elevated temperatures. The element system can also resist high differential pressures without sacrificing performance or suffering mechanical degradation, and is considerably faster to drill-up than a conventional element system. In one aspect, the composite material comprises an epoxy blend reinforced with glass fibers stacked layer upon layer at about 30 to about 70 degrees. A downhole tool, such as a bridge plug, frac-plug, or packer, is also provided. The tool comprises a first and second support ring having one or more tapered wedges, a first and second expansion ring, and a sealing member disposed between the expansion rings and the support rings.
