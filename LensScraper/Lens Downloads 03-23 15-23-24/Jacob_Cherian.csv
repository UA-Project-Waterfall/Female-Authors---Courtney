   The system and method is described herein for preventing HBA port logins to a networked target device unless the HBA has been authorized to perform a port login to that networked device. The HBA driver selectively performs a port login with a target device based on whether the unique hardware address of the target device is included on the HBA driver's unique hardware address access table. During the storage assignment step of the login process, the user selects the target devices that will be assigned to the host. The unique hardware addresses of these target devices will be stored on a unique hardware address access list. During the device discovery step of the login process, the HBA driver compares the unique hardware address of the target device with the unique hardware address access list. If the target device's unique hardware address is listed on the unique hardware address access list, then the HBA driver will proceed with a port login with that target device. If the target device's unique hardware address is not present on the unique hardware address access list, then the HBA driver will forego a port login with that target device.
