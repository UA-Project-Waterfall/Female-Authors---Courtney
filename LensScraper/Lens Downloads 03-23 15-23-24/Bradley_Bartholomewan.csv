CONSTITUTION: Gas flow to a burner 28 is controlled by two valves 32, 34 coupled in series fluidically with a gas conduit 36 conducting from a gas source to the burner 28. When power is supplied, a capacitor C4 is charged with the peak value of voltage across a rectifier CR2 and a secondary winding 48. A voltage limiter circuit 74, a power supply 76 and a thermostat input circuit 78 are connected across the secondary winding 48 through a high temperature limiter 70 and a thermostat 72. When the thermostat 72 demands heat, a Zener diode VR2 breaks down as the voltage across the secondary winding 48 reaches a required breakdown voltage and a high level appears at the input end of an inverter 84. When the voltage across the secondary winding 48 has a reverse polarity, input level to the inverter 84 goes low.",EMERSON ELECTRIC CO,DONNELLY DONALD E;;ZIKES BRADLEY C;;MOORE DWAIN F;;PRICE JEFFREY E;;TOTH BARTHOLOMEW L,,https://lens.org/144-752-183-583-142,Patent Application,no,0,0,15,15,0,F23N5/12;;F23N5/203;;F23N2223/08;;F23N2225/16;;F23N2227/00;;F23N2227/16;;F23N2227/32;;F23N2227/38;;F23N2233/06;;F23N2235/14;;F23N5/203;;F23N5/12;;F23N2223/08;;F23N2225/16;;F23N2227/00;;F23N2227/16;;F23N2227/32;;F23N2227/38;;F23N2233/06;;F23N2235/14,F23D14/00;;F23N5/12;;F23N5/20;;F23Q7/22;;F23Q9/14,,0,0,,,,PENDING
