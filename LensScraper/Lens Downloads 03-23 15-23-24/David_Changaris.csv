In the most general terms, this apparatus comprises a partway closed three-dimensional geometric surface having some thickness, but being hollow inside the partway closed portion and having at least one opening through the surface. The surface is shaped so that a desired radiation source can be placed into the hollow portion inside the surface's partway closed portion. The surface is further shaped so that radiation from the desired radiation source can pass from the hollow inside the surface's partway closed portion through the at least one opening through the surface thereby forming a radiation beam. The surface is constructed of material(s) which the wavelength(s) of the radiation from the desired radiation source will not pass through the surface. An axis for the at least partway closed surface is defined which does not intersect the at least one opening through the surface. By rotating the surface about this axis, the radiation beam revolves in space. At any specific location which the radiation beam intersects, a radiation pulse will be sensed. Other surfaces can be employed with the at least partway closed surface to further restrict the radiation pattern of the radiation beam.

The method utilizes a power supply having a periodic voltage signal. The method times the discharge of the flash lamp to occur when the power supply signal is below the flash lamp self extinguishing voltage such that the flash lamp de-ionizes while the power supply signal remains below the self extinguishing voltage, thus preventing afterglow. The circuit utilizes a means for detecting when the voltage of the power supply voltage signal falls below the self extinguishing voltage to trigger the flash lamp. An additional embodiment adds a means for interrupting current flow in the flash lamp before the voltage across a storage capacitor falls below said self extinguishing voltage.
