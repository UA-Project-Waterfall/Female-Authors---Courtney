In an embodiment, the method comprises the steps of determining the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for each pulse, and multiplying the FFT by a pulse compression reference function. The method then proceeds by shifting phase of the pulse-compressed FFT by applying a first factor derived from a ground reference point and a second factor derived from a velocity-acceleration hypothesis to provide phase-shifted data, shifting the envelope of the phase-shifted data by applying one factor derived from range history and a second factor derived from a velocity-acceleration hypothesis to provide aligned data, and determining the Inverse FFT for the aligned data to provide a set of target data of the form H(p,i 1 ,i 2 ,i 3 ), where p is CPI number, i 1 is range index, i 2 is velocity index, and i 3 is coarse acceleration index, the latter three indices each referenced to the starting time of the first CPI. In a further embodiment, the invention encompasses first performing coherent integration for each CPI within a dwell of CPIs, then performing non-coherent integration in an efficient way, taking full advantage of the alignment to the starting time of the first CPI.",NORTHROP GRUMMAN SPACE & MSN,CLARK DAVID CHARLES,NORTHROP GRUMMAN SPACE & MISSION SYSTEMS CORP (2009-11-25);;NORTHROP GRUMMAN SPACE & MISSIONS SYSTEMS CORP (2006-10-20);;NORTHROP GRUMMAN SYSTEMS CORPORATION (2009-12-10),https://lens.org/018-901-717-775-172,Granted Patent,yes,3,7,2,2,0,G01S13/5246;;G01S7/2883;;G01S13/5246;;G01S7/2883,G01S13/00;;G01S13/52,342/160;;342/196,1,1,074-559-268-800-191,10.1109/nrc.1993.270453,"Fast pulse Doppler radar processing accounting for range bin migration T.L.

The hoist line placing device comprises a rigid, elongated, telescopic, tubular pole 21 with a hoist line 30 coaxially threaded through it from bottom to top, and with the free end of the hoist line attached to a closable fastener 40. A supply of hoist line 30 is wound on a line storage device or spool 31 disposed at or near the bottom end of the tubular pole. The support cable assembly comprises a running loop collar 51 connected to the top end of a support cable 60, with a retrieval cable 70 also connected to the support cable at a predetermined position below the running loop collar. The method by which the support cable assembly is used comprises the following steps: (a) placing the hoist line over an overhead object; (b) attaching one end of the hoist line to the bottom end of the support cable; (c) hoisting the support cable over the overhead object until the running loop collar is disposed at eye level; (d) threading the hoist line through the running loop collar to form a running closed loop around the overhead object; and (e) tightening the running closed loop around the overhead object; and thereafter (f) removing the support cable assembly from the overhead object by pulling down on the retrieval cable until the running closed loop comes apart and the support cable assembly falls to the ground.",TREE PLAY LLC,CLARK L CHARLES,TREE PLAY LLC (1997-08-01),https://lens.org/191-954-280-018-663,Granted Patent,yes,22,33,1,1,0,B25J1/04;;B25J1/04,B25J1/04,294/19.1;;294/24,3,0,,,"Solid Natural Wood Swing 1996 Lillian Vernou Corp.

Nov. 15, 1963 [Nov. 23, 1962], No. 44479/62. Heading H2E. In a multi-contact, fluid-pressure resistant connector, each tubular socket member is held within a bore 7, Fig. 3, in the two-part insulating body by means of a peripheral flange 1, which fits in a corresponding recess in the bore the socket member being removed (or inserted) using a tool 19 whose semi-cylindrical arms fit around the tapered end of a slotted end portion of the socket member and are forced together to press the fingers 17a, Fig. 2, of the slotted portion together and thus enable the flange 18 to pass through the bore past the shoulder 9. The socket member has a pin-receiving portion 13, Fig. 2, which is slit at 13a to form a resilient socket, the portion 12 acting as the entry aperture. The middle and deformable portion 14 of the socket member, has a smaller diameter bore than the end portions and receives a conductor 15 to which it may be crimped (at 14a). The insulating covering 15a is accommodated in the slotted end portion and the ends of portion 14 are crimped on to it at 16a. A sealing washer 11 is situated in the bore between the two insulating bodies, which are mounted in a metal housing.",C W C EQUIPMENT LTD,CLARK CHARLES WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/119-048-073-279-988,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,4,0,H01R13/428;;H01R13/64,H01R13/428;;H01R13/64,H2E EDAA          EDAA251;;H2E E10B          -;;H2E E118          EDAA251;;H2E E18           -;;H2E E22B          -;;H2E E251          EDAA251;;H2E E3A13         -;;H2E E3A15         -;;H2E E3A4A         -;;H2E E3A4E         -;;H2E E3A6H         -;;H2E E3B6          -;;H2E E3C6D2        -;;H2E E3D2          -;;H2E E3E9          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

When roaming, a device will seek to establish a satisfactory connection using the subscriber identity and local network specified by the first preference entry for the roaming country. If no local network is specified, any available network will be used, preferably the network providing the highest quality connection. If a satisfactory connection cannot be achieved, the next table entry is read to obtain an alternative subscriber identity and local network. The table comprises at least one group of entries for use in a country corresponding to the group, which specifies at least a first and second subscriber identity from first and second home networks respectively.

In an embodiment, the method comprises the steps of determining the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for each pulse, and multiplying the FFT by a pulse compression reference function. The method then proceeds by shifting phase of the pulse-compressed FFT by applying a first factor derived from a ground reference point and a second factor derived from a velocity-acceleration hypothesis to provide phase-shifted data, shifting the envelope of the phase-shifted data by applying one factor derived from range history and a second factor derived from a velocity-acceleration hypothesis to provide aligned data, and determining the Inverse FFT for the aligned data to provide a set of target data of the form H(p,i 1 ,i 2 ,i 3 ), where p is CPI number, i 1 is range index, i 2 is velocity index, and i 3 is coarse acceleration index, the latter three indices each referenced to the starting time of the first CPI.

A solder element (24) is disposed within the channel (20), and a conductive pin (28) is mounted in the housing (11) to pass through the channel (20) and the solder element (24). The channel (20) defines a loading axis (22) angled with respect to the pin (28), and the channel (20) is shaped to receive the solder element (24) along the loading axis (22) and positively to retain the solder element (24) from movement along the pin (28). The pin (28) prevents the solder element (24) from moving along the loading axis (22) out of the channel (20). Several methods for assembling such electrical connectors (10; 10) are described, and in these methods the solder element (24) is moved along the loading axis (22) into the channel (20) within the housing (11), and then the pin (28) is moved into the housing (11) through the pin receiving aperture (16) and through the solder element (24) in order to stake the solder element (24) in place and prevent it from moving out of the channel (20) along the loading axis (22).

Coin operated recording and reproducing apparatus. C. W. CLARK. 24 March, 1966 [24 March, 1965], No. 12498/65. Heading G5R. An arrangement in which on insertion of a coin of low denomination, a customer can select one of ten sound tracks recorded on tape for play back over a loudspeaker or, on insertion of a coin of larger denomination, can record the selected track on a disc record which is then delivered to the customer. The tape play back arrangement includes a ten track endless tape, a multiple pick up head providing one head for each track of the tape and a control circuit, Figs. 1 and 2 (not shown), by which on insertion of a coin of either denomination the tape drive, sound amplifiers and push button track selection panel are energized. Additionally on insertion of the larger denomination coin the disc record recording apparatus is also energized. The record to be cut is clamped on a turntable 27 by means of an arm 32 and the turntable is rim driven by means of a rubber tyred wheel 36 which also engages a driven shaft 35. A cutting head 44 is mounted on a carriage 46 which is driven along a shaft 47 when the cutting head is in its lowered (cutting) position by means of a follower in the base of the carriage which engages a lead screw 55 rotated via a belt 58 and gearing from the turntable. At the end of the recording period an overdrive arrangement speeds up the rotation of the lead screw to form run out grooves on the record. The cutting head is raised or lowered by a long cam member C which engages a follower at the rear of the carriage and pivots it about its support shaft 47. At the end of the record cutting programme the recorded record is delivered to the output shoot 75 and a new blank is moved from the stack of blanks M to the turntable by means of the large diameter disc 72 which is formed with three circular apertures 73 slightly larger in diameter than the records. The disc 72 is mounted on a shaft 74 and is connected to a second disc 82 which is notched at 120 degree intervals. On completion of cutting the clamp arm 32 is raised, the solenoid 86 is energized to raise the detent 84 engaging one of the notches and the disc is rotated via gearing 79 by a pair of drive wheels which engage the upper and lower surfaces of the disc. At the end of 120 degrees rotation the detent drops into the next notch and the disc drive is discontinued. This 120 degree rotation of the notched disc 82 is also used to return the carriage to its initial position by means of an arm 98 which is pivoted by one of the pins 89 formed on the disc and engages a carriage return thrust rod 101. After initial switch on by insertion of the large denomination coin the record making process is automatic being controlled by the switches M operated by moving parts of the machine.",CHARLES WILLIAM CLARK,CLARK CHARLES WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/138-255-058-390-187,Granted Patent,no,0,2,2,2,0,G07F17/305;;G07F17/305;;G11B3/08529;;G11B3/08529;;G11B3/0859;;G11B3/0859;;G11B17/10;;G11B17/10;;G11B19/08;;G11B19/08;;G11B27/022;;G11B27/022;;G11B27/026;;G11B27/026;;G11B27/36;;G11B27/36;;G11B2220/20;;G11B2220/20,G07F11/00;;G07F17/30;;G11B3/085;;G11B17/10;;G11B19/08;;G11B27/022;;G11B27/026;;G11B27/36,G5R RB264         71;;G5R RB37Y         71;;G5R RB38Y         71;;G5R RB39X         71;;G5R RB39Y         71;;G5R RB423         71;;G5R RB443         71;;G5R RB451         71;;G5R RB483         71;;G5R RB488         71;;G5R RB55X         71;;G5R RB55Y         71;;G5R RB71          71;;G5R RB72Y         71;;G5R RB93          71;;G5R RED           RED;;G5R RGB           RGB;;G5R R21BY         --;;G5R R21B1C        --;;G5R R21B1Y        --;;G5R R21F          --;;G5R R21Y          --;;G5R R22BY         --;;G5R R22B3C        --;;G5R R22B3Y        --;;G5R R22B4AY       --;;G5R R22B4A1B      --;;G5R R22B4A1Y      --;;G5R R22B4BY       --;;G5R R22B4B1       --;;G5R R22B4Y        --;;G5R R22EY         --;;G5R R22E3AY       --;;G5R R22E3A1       --;;G5R R22E3A2A      --;;G5R R22E3A2Y      --;;G5R R22E3Y        --;;G5R R22E6D        --;;G5R R22E6Y        --,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The entries are provided with an order of preference, indicated by the order of columns in the table. An entry may specify a subscriber identity (IMSI 1, IMSI 2 etc.) and a local network (Voda, Telfort etc.), or only a subscriber identity. When roaming, a device will seek to establish a satisfactory connection using the subscriber identity and local network specified by the first preference entry for the roaming country. If a satisfactory connection cannot be achieved, the next most preferred table entry is read to obtain an alternative selection of subscriber identity and local network. At least one group of entries (e.g. for Netherlands) specifies two different subscriber identities (IMSI 1, IMSI 2). Specifying multiple subscriber identities and multiple local networks in the group of entries improves reliability by allowing a satisfactory connection to be achieved from another local network, if a specified local network is not available and allows an alternative subscriber identity from an alternative home network to be used, in the event that a failure in a home network prevents the establishment of a connection.

Nov. 19, 1968 [Nov. 20, 1967], No.52748/67. Heading G2A. In coin-freed photographic apparatus having provision for making one large or four small images of a subject on photographic material 20 supported in a slotted plate 22, two cameras 10, 11 are provided, there being a guide linkage for moving the cameras relative to the plate 22 in such a way that the initial and terminal relative movements are parallel to the camera axes. Insertion of a coin and selection of the image format causes a motor (not shown) to rotate so as to drive a crank 35 anti-clockwise (as seen). This crank moves the two cameras 10, 11 and parallel links 27, 28 (25, 26, Fig.3, not shown) guide the cameras in arcuate paths so that the appropriate camera is aligned with the material 20. The links also carry a border producing system 24 having two sections 36, 37 each containing a flash tube 43, 44. One section is for producing a border around the single image and the other for producing borders around the four images produced by the camera 11. Movement of the links also positions the correct section of the system 24 behind the material 20. When the motor driving the crank 35 stops, the apparatus is ready for exposure, and the tubes 43, 44 are operated either automatically or upon operation of a control by the subject. The material 20 is then exposed by the selected camera, and the exposed sheet fed to developing apparatus (7, Fig.1, not shown). Material is stored in a magazine (2) and cut into sheets by a guillotine (45).",CLARK CHARLES WILLIAM,CLARK CHARLES WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/048-933-547-325-607,Granted Patent,no,0,0,5,5,0,G03B17/53;;G03B17/53,G03B17/53,G2A AAE           AE;;G2A A401          AE;;G2A A403          AE;;G2A A416          AE;;G2A A419          AE;;G2A A420          AE;;G2A A443          AE;;G2A A473          AE;;G2A A572          AE;;G2A A749          AE;;G2A A753          AE;;G2A A754          AE,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Nov.15, 1968 [Nov.15, 1967], No. 52056/67. Heading G2A. In an automatic (e.g. coin-operated) photographic apparatus a plate having two or more apertures of different sizes therein can be moved so as to bring any of the apertures into alignment with the lens system. In such apparatus the processing liquids gradually lose their strength, and this is compensated for by moving a larger aperture into the optical path. The form of apparatus shown comprises two cameras 11, 12, one arranged to take a single large picture as an alternative to the other which is arranged to take four smaller pictures. Camera 11 has an objective 11A, in front of which is mounted a sector-shaped aperture plate 15, movable about a pivot 16 by a handle 16A. Plate 15 has three apertures 17, 18, 19, of increasing size, any one of which may be aligned with the objective 11A. Camera 12 has four objectives 12A, 12B, 12C, 12D. In this case the aperture plate 23, movable about a pivot 22, has four sets of apertures, one set for each objective. Thus as the plate 23 pivots, apertures 27A, 26A, 25A, of gradually increasing size, can be brought respectively in alignment with objective 12A. Similarly, apertures 27B, 26B, 25B can be aligned with objective 12B, and apertures 27D, 26D, 25D with objective 12D. Only two plate apertures 27C, 26C are provided for objective 12C, the objective being completely uncovered for its third setting.",CLARK CHARLES WILLIAM,CLARK CHARLES WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/194-196-276-072-455,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G03B17/53,G03B17/53,G2A AAE           AE;;G2A A401          AE;;G2A A403          AE;;G2A A416          AE;;G2A A420          AE;;G2A A422          AE;;G2A A443          AE;;G2A A464          AE;;G2A A470          AE;;G2A A749          AE;;G2A A753          AE;;G2A A754          AE,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The apertures are shaped so that a land (14) is defined between adjacent apertures (6) to form an inclined strut (14) operative to deform as a result of axial loading applied to the sleeve whereby to result in a contraction in the axial length of the sleeve. Each aperture is so shaped that an abrupt change (4) in the direction of the edge of the aperture defines a point at which the adjacent strut starts to deform as a result of stress concentration arising at the point under the applied load. The abrupt change in direction occurs at positions substantially at each axial end of the apertured region defined in the sleeve by the apertures. The defined stress concentration points provide determinable characteristics for the contraction of the sleeve which facilitates 'pull down' upon setting of the anchor.,RAMSET FASTENERS AUST PTY LTD;;CLARK PHILIP CHARLES,CLARK PHILIP CHARLES,,https://lens.org/023-378-830-081-663,Patent Application,yes,4,9,15,15,0,F16B13/065,F16B7/00;;E04B1/41;;F16B13/06,,1,0,,,See also references of EP 0809758A4,PATENTED

Movable-abutment type; balancing moving parts; valve-gear.-In a rotary engine of the Roots'-blower type comprising two intermeshing gear - wheels 10, 11 arranged in a casing 18 so as to have a substantial clearance on all sides of the teeth, the motive fluid is admitted through a port 15 between the line of centres of the wheels and the apex of a closely-fitting member 12 which is fitted with plates 14 adjoining the faces of the wheels. According to the invention, one of the plates 14 is made integral with the casing, while the other plate is adjustable by means of metal spacing-sheets placed between it and the member 12, which is non- adjustably secured to the casing. The motive fluid escapes from the edges 16, 17 of the member 12, which may be suitably shaped to reduce noise, into the casing 18, which may be fitted with an exhaust pipe 19. The plate 14 may be fitted with two members 12, 12<1>, having inlet and outlet ports 15, 15<1> interchangeable for reversing. The radial fluid thrust on the gear-wheels is balanced by arranging the edges 16, 17, 16', 17<1> of the members 12, 12<1> to fall within 90 degrees of the line joining the centres of the wheels. Auxiliary discharge passages 22, 22' may be formed in the members 12, 12'. Reversible compound engines are described in which the motive fluid is tapped at a number of points in each stage for use in a number of successive stages.",CLARK CHARLES HASKELL,CLARK CHARLES HASKELL,,https://lens.org/003-824-391-727-400,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Nov.20, 1968 [Nov.20, 1967], No.52749/67. Heading G2A. Photographic developing apparatus, e.g. for use in an automatic photographic kiosk Fig.1, (not shown), comprises eight processing tanks 41; a pair of continuous chain conveyers 33 above the tanks, from between which chains carriers 70 for exposed photo-sensitive sheets are suspended in pendulum fashion; and upper and lower rows of sprockets 31, 32 defining a zig-zag path for the lower run of the chains 33 such that each carrier is dipped into and withdrawn from the tanks in succession as the chains advance. Sequence of operations. After a length of photosensitive material is exposed by the kiosk camera, it is fed towards feed in rollers 52 and the exposed length cut off. The strip trips a micro-switch (M7) Fig. 7, (not shown) which causes a switching unit to switch on a cam motor, which in turn starts the conveyer drive motor. The chains 33 are advanced until a switch 72, forming part of a carrier 70, trips a micro-switch (M8) indicating that a carrier is correctly positioned to receive the cut off sheet. Tripping this switch (M8) stops movement of the conveyer and starts a motor (101) to drive rollers 52, 53, 54 to feed the sheet into the waiting carrier. As the sheet clears the rollers 54 it trips a microswitch (M9) stopping the motor (101); starting the conveyer motor via the cam motor; and feeding a positive pulse to a counter. The chains 33 are advanced to dip the filled carrier in the left hand tank 41. Then another stud 72 trips a microswitch M14 causing the conveyer motor to stop with the sheet in the tank. Then ensues a dwell period of four seconds before the cam motor, now rotating continuously, restarts the conveyer motor to withdraw the filled carrier from the tank, while the next carrier enters the tank. During the ensuing dwell period the first carrier drains into the first tank. This stepwise movement continues until the carrier reaches the right hand end of the apparatus, when the upper ends of the carrier are carried along the conveyer upper run 34 while the carrier engages a shield 90 thereby inclining the sheet. The upper edge of the sheet eventually trips a micro-switch (M10) to start a feed out motor (105), the sheet being withdrawn from the carrier and fed out by rollers 55-58. The feed out motor is stopped after its associated driving chain has completed one revolution. As the sheet leaves rollers 58 it trips a micro-switch (M12) which delivers a negative pulse to the counter. When the resultant pulse summed by the counter is zero, it causes the switching unit to switch off the cam motor. Hence the next time M14 is activated to switch off the conveyer motor, it will not be restarted after four seconds.",CLARK CHARLES WILLIAM,CLARK CHARLES WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/079-947-420-172-094,Granted Patent,no,0,0,5,5,0,G03B17/53;;G03B17/53,G03B17/53,G2A AAC           AC;;G2A A401          -;;G2A A403          -;;G2A A433          AC;;G2A A473          AC;;G2A A572          AC;;G2A A574          AC;;G2A A624          AC;;G2A A629          AC;;G2A A635          AC;;G2A A708          AC;;G2A A753          AC;;G2A A754          AC;;G2X XS1           XS1;;G2X X20A1B        XS1;;G2X X20A12        XS1;;G2X X20A3A        XS1;;G2X X20A5A        XS1;;G2X X20C1         -;;G2X X20F          XS1;;G2X X20H1         XS1;;G2X X20H2         XS1,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A mechanism is provided for detecting new devices added to a Fibre Channel adapter. When a device is added to a connector, the mechanism generates a device detect signal for that port. The Fibre controller receives device detect signals for the existing ports and generates port select signals to configure the port bypass. The controller may then simply poll the device detect signals in an internal register to automatically detect a new device being added or a device being removed without breaking the loop and without a high software overhead.

The device is compact enough so that it may take an accurate reading of the thickness of a brake pad while being between the caliper housing and the brake pad backing plate of a vehicle. The device also comprises a spring so that once it is correctly placed, it may be manipulated in order to automatically get a reading of the thickness of a brake pad to the closest millimeter or 32 nd of an inch by releasing the spring to cause a measurement to be automatically taken.

Two-stroke engines; driving gear. UNITED ENGINES Ltd. July 27, 1959 [April 30, 1958], No. 13828/58. Class 7(2) In a two-stroke opposed piston swash-plate engine the piston rods 11 pass through apertures 20 in partition walls 20a at the rear ends of the cylinders and are shaped so that they substantially seal the apertures over a major portion of their travel, whereby air or mixture entering through auxiliary inlets 19 is compressed by the pistons on their outstrokes and delivered to the scavenging receiver 6. The piston rods have thick portions lid which close the apertures 11d and thin portions 11c which open the apertures towards the end of the piston outstroke to permit the change compressed between the piston and partition 20a to flow through apertures 20 to charge 21 and then through parts 6a into the receiver 6. In a modification the charge is forced through apertures in the cylinder wall adjacent the partition 20a direct to the receiver 6.

Centrifugal governors; transmitting-mechansim; fluid relays.-A centrifugal governor with the weights 14 rotating about the axis of the shaft 12 and with their pivots or fulcra 17 lying in a plane at right-angles to the axis is so constructed that the radius of the circular path traversed by the centre of gravity of the weights when in their innermost position is approximately one and a half times the distance of the centre of gravity from the pivot of the weight. The arrangement is such that the centrifugal force varies approximately as the angular displacement of the weights from the plane of the pivots. The weights, which may be four in number, are in the form of quadrantal gears as shown and they are fulcrumed at 17 on knife-edges within the casing and guided by slots in the neck 15 of the casing. The casing is rotated by the shaft 12 driven by the engine to be governed. The weights gear with and are held in place by the valveoperating rod 21, the end of which is in the form of a rack 23 and, in swinging outwards under the action of centrifugal force, the rod 21 is moved to the right against the action of a compression spring 25 adjusted by the screw nut 22 according to the governing speed required. With a slight modification of construction, an extension spring may be used instead of a compression spring. The shaft 21 carries at its outer end a number of split rings 31, Figs. 1 and 4, fitting rotatably within circular grooves in the shaft and clamped to a correspondingly grooved non-rotating casing 27 by the block 30 and screw 33. The lower part of the casing is provided with lubricant 34. The casing is slidably connected to one end of a centrally-pivoted lever 35, Fig. 5, the other end of which is connected to the supply valve of the engine. The central pivot of the lever is arranged upon a fork 36 pivoted in a standard 37 screw-threaded within a rotatable socket 38 which is oppositely screw-threaded within the valve casing so that the pivot of the lever 35 can be adjusted at right - angles to the lever thereby determining the extent of movement of the governor weights, and consequently the speed at which the governor operates. The valve which is operated by the lever 35 comprises a cylindrical chamber 46 with inlet 47 and outlet 48 and a piston 51 with unequal heads 49, 50, and with passages 52, 53. The inlet pressure maintains the valve closed owing to the equalization of the pressures above and below the head 49 due to the passage 53. If, however, the stem 41 is withdrawn, due to a decrease in speed of the engine, the unbalanced upward pressure on the head 49 raises the piston, and thereby connecting together the inlet and outlet and supplying further working fluid to the engine.

Cotton, C. C., and Kennedy, W. C. June 1. Heckling - machines, electric stopmotions for. In case of obstruction to the movement of the main catchbars, or the cross catch-bars of the automatic screwing - attachment, an electric circuit is broken or completed whereby the driving-strap is transferred to the loose pulley. The catchbar d, Fig. 1, is reciprocated from the usual oscillating arm by a link which in one arrangement is constructed in two parts a, b, the part a terminating in a piston f fitting between springs g, h of equal resilience in a cylinder e secured to the part b. The part a carries an electric switch B, Figs. 1 and 2, comprising terminals k<1>, k<2> and a pivoted arm k connected electrically with the terminal k<1> and provided with a projecting stud k' normally bearing on the terminal k<2>. The stud k<4> extends through a slot j in, but is insulated from, a bar i secured to the cylinder e. In case of obstruction, the cylinder e moves relatively to the part a sufficiently to move the switch arm k and thus break the circuit ; or it may be arranged to close the circuit. In another arrangement, the part a, Fig. 3, extends through bearings in the part b and is recessed so as to be clipped between, and held by, springs g', h' or engaged by a spring stud ; another recess m<3> permits the spring arm m of a switch B to separate the contacts. The relative movement of the parts a, b caused by an obstruction depresses the spring arm m and completes the circuit. When the obstruction causes the circuit to be closed, a current is passed through a solenoid s, Fig. 8, which then withdraws the pivoted catch-lever t<6>, the balanced pivoted lever t<3> then allowing the pivoted lever t to release the spring rod u. An arm on the rod u embraces the strap fork rod w and bears against a collar thereon so that a movement of the rod u transfers the belt to the loose pulley, the arrangement permitting the strap to be so moved independently of the rod u. When the circuit is normally closed, as in Figs. 1 and 2, a solenoid supports a core against the action of a spring, breakage of the circuit due to an obstruction allowing the core to fall and release the pivoted levers as previously described.",COTTON CHARLES CLARK;;KENNEDY WILLIAM CHARLES,COTTON CHARLES CLARK;;KENNEDY WILLIAM CHARLES,,https://lens.org/080-336-261-298-847,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

When conduction occurs through the collector-to-emitter path of the second transistor, a conducting diode connected between the emitter of the first transistor and the collector of the second transistor clamps this collector to a relatively fixed voltage level referenced to the fixed base voltage of the first transistor. This prevents saturation of the second transistor and thus reduces the ""storage delay"", that is the turn-off time delay of the second transistor. In addition, the charge stored at the base electrode of the second transistor is removed when its collector-to-emitter current flow is interrupted to further reduce the turn-off time of this transistor.",RCA CORP,CLARK JR CHARLES ALBERT;;ADAM KENNETH CHARLES,SP-COMMERCIAL FLIGHT INC.

Clipping occurs when a waveform exceeds a dynamic range of a recording device. Portions of an audio signal exceeding the dynamic range or saturation level of the recording device are clipped, causing distortion when the clipped recorded signal is played. To address this problem, successive frames of the clipped audio data are repaired to fill in gaps where the data were clipped. For each frame, an iterative process repetitively estimates an auto-covariance and detects clipped samples in the frame or a sub-frame in order to compute a least-squares solution for the frame that interpolates the clipped data. The process can cause inverted peaks in the repaired data, which must then be rectified to produced corrected repaired data. The corrected repaired data for the successive frames are recombined using interpolation, to produce a complete repaired audio data set.",ATLAS LES;;CLARK CHARLES PASCAL;;UNIV WASHINGTON,ATLAS LES;;CLARK CHARLES PASCAL,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON (2007-09-20),https://lens.org/029-874-675-873-310,Granted Patent,yes,12,6,2,2,0,G10L19/005;;G10L21/02;;G10L25/12;;G10L21/02;;G10L19/005;;G10L25/12,G06F17/00,700/94;;704/219;;704/265,8,6,067-897-848-702-051;;051-514-814-128-109;;021-058-218-314-963;;007-929-634-069-884;;077-991-715-398-731;;042-872-842-951-438,10.1109/icassp.2001.940720;;10.1109/tassp.1986.1164824;;10.1109/tim.2005.847222;;10.1109/icassp.1985.1168128;;10.1109/78.193215;;10.1109/icassp.2003.1199990,"Abel, Jonathan S., and Julius O.

Shore, B., and Clark, C. T. June 18. Projectile fuses. - Relates to fuse - setting machines of the kind mounted on a supporting- ring which is adapted to be locked in the zero position on the fuse, and consists in mounting on the supporting-ring an adjustable index member, and a rotary setting-member adapted to co-operate with the index, and carrying- means for setting the timing-ring, this means being so constructed that, no matter where the pin on the timing-ring happens to rest initially with respect to the fuse scale, the ring may be correctly set by rotating the setting-member first in the clockwise sense, and then in the counterclockwise sense, as far as possible. In the form shown in Fig. 1, the fuse-setter comprises a circular base a, Fig. 1, graduated round its periphery, and a rotary head d engaging an annular recess b in the base a. In a peripheral groove f of the base slides a carrier g, with which moves an index-plate k. This index may be clamped by a nut m opposite any desired graduation of the scale. When the index has been thus set, the fuse-setter is placed on the fuse and rotated until a stud n on the base a enters a recess on the fuse and locks the two together. On rotating the head d in a counterclockwise sense in the base, a stop p in an annular channel o in the interior of the head d engages the usual pin on the time-ring of the fuse, and rotates the ring until a projection q on the head d abuts against a stop r on the plate k. The fuse is then set. If the pin on the time-ring happens initially to rest at a graduation of the fuse scale higher than that to which it is to be set, a clockwise rotation of the head d precedes the counter-clockwise rotation, so that the pin on the time-ring may be displaced by the reverse side of the stop p until it lies opposite a graduation lower than that to which it is to be set. An auxiliary index slide may be mounted on the main slide k for fine adjustment. A box spanner may be rotatably mounted on the head d in order to manipulate the lock-nuts of fuses provided with such.",SHORE BENJAMIN;;CLARK CHARLES TURNER,SHORE BENJAMIN;;CLARK CHARLES TURNER,,https://lens.org/113-003-759-849-327,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,F42C17/02,F42C17/02,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The signal is first divided into a plurality of subbands, since the gaps in each subband are individually easier to interpolate. Coherent demodulation is then employed on each subband signal to reduce the time-varying signals to a collection of pairs of frequency-modulated carriers multiplied by complex-valued envelopes, or modulators. Standard interpolation is then separately applied to the modulators and carriers of these pairs to fill-in the gaps in each of the subbands, and the interpolated pairs are remodulated.

Clipping occurs when a waveform exceeds a dynamic range of a recording device. Portions of an audio signal exceeding the dynamic range or saturation level of the recording device are clipped, causing distortion when the clipped recorded signal is played. To address this problem, successive frames of the clipped audio data are repaired to fill in gaps where the data were clipped. For each frame, an iterative process repetitively estimates an auto-covariance and detects clipped samples in the frame or a sub-frame in order to compute a least-squares solution for the frame that interpolates the clipped data. The process can cause inverted peaks in the repaired data, which must then be rectified to produced corrected repaired data. The corrected repaired data for the successive frames are recombined using interpolation, to produce a complete repaired audio data set.",UNIV WASHINGTON,ATLAS LES;;CLARK CHARLES PASCAL,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON (2007-09-20),https://lens.org/119-061-071-930-26X,Patent Application,yes,12,19,2,2,0,G10L19/005;;G10L21/02;;G10L25/12;;G10L21/02;;G10L19/005;;G10L25/12,G10L19/00,704/219,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

Shore, B., and Clark, C. T. June 18. Projectile fuses.-Consists in employing on a fuse-setting machine means for giving an audible or other sensitive indication each time the adjustable index - member of the machine registers with a division or subdivision of the setting-scale. The device is described as applied to the fuse - setting machine of Specification 13,756/14, which comprises a circular base a, Fig. 1, graduated around its periphery, and a rotary head d engaging an annular recess b in the base a. In a. peripheral groove f of the base slides a carrier g, with which moves an index plate k. This index may be clamped by a nut m opposite any desired graduation of the scale. To facilitate the setting of the index in the dark, a series of indentations is formed on the base a corresponding with the graduations on the setting-scale, and with these indentations a spring pin v, Figs. 7 and 8, carried by the index member g engages, so that each time the index plate k moves over a division of the setting-scale, a click which may be heard or felt occurs. When the index has been thus set, the fuse-setter is placed on the fuse and rotated until a stud n on the base a enters a recess on the fuse and locks the two together. On rotating the head d in a counterclockwise sense in the base, a stop p in an annular channel o in the interior of the head d engages the usual pin on the time-ring of the fuse. and rotates the ring until a projection q on the head d abuts against a stop r on the plate k. The fuse is then set. If the pin on the time-ring happens initially to rest at a graduation of the fuse scale higher than that to which it is to be set, a clockwise rotation of the head d will precede the counterclockwise rotation, so that the pin on the time-ring may be displaced by the reverse side of the stop p until it lies opposite a graduation lower than that to which it is to be set. An auxiliary index slide s may be mounted on the main slide k for fine adjustment, and a clicking-pin t operating similarly to the device v is mounted on this.",SHORE BENJAMIN;;CLARK CHARLES TURNER,SHORE BENJAMIN;;CLARK CHARLES TURNER,,https://lens.org/001-501-715-856-307,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,F42C17/02,F42C17/02,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   Systems, methods and devices for in situ soil sterilization using contained microwave energy, and more specifically methods and devices for removing from the soil to a specified depth in situ substantially all biological pests. The method comprises exposing the specified depth of soil to sufficient energy flux, within a sufficiently short exposure time, of microwave frequency electromagnetic radiation at a frequency tuned to dissociate biopolymers. The device comprises: a source of microwave frequency electromagnetic radiation; a carriage; and, optionally a radiation shield and a cooling system. The carriage moves the source of electromagnetic radiation to an area for treatment and the radiation shield prevents leakage of radiation to undesired points. The cooling system maintains the device at a sufficiently cool temperature for reliable operation.

INTERNATIONAL NICKEL Ltd. 20 Sept., 1967, No. 42774/67. Addition to 1,104,656. Heading B3R. A bit for a soldering iron formed from tungsten or molybdenum has a tip of or consisting predominantly of ruthenium coated with or superficially alloyed with palladium, platinum, copper or an alloy of any two or all three of these elements. The tip and methods of forming a coating or superficial alloy on it are as described in Specification 1,104,656 and may consist predominantly of ruthenium coated with or superficially alloyed with palladium or platinum or superficially alloyed with a coating of palladium diffused into the tip or coated with copper. The ruthemium of the tip may be alloyed with 0À25-2À5% rhenium. In an example, a disc is cut from a sheet of hot rolled and annealed molybdenum, is plated with palladium and heat treated at 1000‹ C. in hydrogen so that the palladium diffuses and forms a superficial alloy with the ruthenium. The disc is then electric resistance welded to a 45 degrees diagonally ground end on a molybdenum rod.

Apparatus for forming a cylindrical member, e.g. bush or bearing, comprises a die cavity 2 defined by a rotatable mandrel 3 and the cavity wall 2a into which a strip S is fed and deformed therein to the shape of the die cavity. The strips are fed individually from a magazine (14), Fig. 3 (not shown), by a reciprocating push-rod 11 through a slot 13. The mandrel 3 is preferably rotated in a direction to oppose the strip feed and may have surface rollers 8 or surface projections. If desired the cylindrical member may be composed of a number of arcuate portions in which case correspondingly smaller strips are fed successively to the die cavity. When the strip has completely entered the die the plunger 16 is raised to shape the rear end of the strip. The formed member is ejected by an electrically, mechanically or hydraulically operated sleeve 10 mounted on the mandrel shaft from the cavity either into a space between the cavity 2 and a forming die cavity 9 or directly into the forming die cavity. In the forming die cavity the ends of the strip are butt-jointed together. The ends of the strip may be plain, inclined or notched in a complementary fashion. The apparatus may be arranged with the mandrel shaft horizontal or vertical.",ASS ENG LTD,BRYANT JOHN DENNIS;;CLARK CHARLES KEITH,,https://lens.org/140-484-679-763-856,Granted Patent,no,0,1,2,2,0,B21K1/06;;B21D51/00;;B21J13/14;;B21K27/02;;F16C33/00,B21D51/00;;B21K1/04;;F16C33/00,B3A A26           -;;B3E ENC           ENC;;B3E E1L           ENC;;B3E E1R           ENC;;B3E E1Y           ENC;;B3E E10A10        ENC;;B3E E10A15        ENC;;B3E E10A8         ENC;;B3E E10C1         ENC;;B3E E10C4         ENC;;B3E E14G          ENC;;B3M M1            -;;B3M M11AX         -;;B3M M11C          -;;B3M M12B1         -;;B3M M14B          -;;B3M M19B          -;;B3M M2            -;;B3M M9E           -;;F2A AD44          AD44;;F2A A151          AD44;;F2A A192          AD44,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The alkali hypochlorite may be prepared continuously in situ by passing chlorine into a continuous stream of caustic alkali maintained at 0 DEG to 5 DEG C., and ammonia may then be injected into such stream to react with the alkali hypochlorite. In examples gaseous chlorine is passed into aqueous sodium hydroxide until the pH was 11 or still alkaline and the resulting sodium hypochlorite solution added to aqueous ammonia containing 0.2 per cent by weight of glue to yield an aqueous solution of monochloroamine.ALSO:Alkyl hydrazines having the formula <FORM:0800248/IV (b)/1> wherein R is an alkyl radical and R1 is hydrogen or an alkyl radical, are prepared by reacting in aqueous medium monochloroamine with an alkyl amine having the formula RR1NH. The reaction is preferably conducted at temperatures of from 10 DEG to 60 DEG C. and using alkylamine to monochloroamine molar ratios of from 2 : 1 to 8 : 1. The monochloroamine reactant may be prepared in situ by reacting one to four molar equivalents of ammonia with sodium hypochlorite in an aqueous solution maintained at a temperature of between 0 DEG and 15 DEG C. The process may be adapted to continuous working. Specified amines are methylamine, ethylamine, diethylamine, dimethylamine, n-propylamine, isopropylamine, diisopropylamine, n - butylamine, and n-amylamine.

FEED SERVICE (LIVESTOCK) Ltd. 11 April, 1968 [14 April, 1967], No. 17264/67. Heading A1M. [Also in Division F1] A liquid feeding appliance has a control valve operated, directly or through a pumping action, by movement of licking plate on to which the material is discharged. In the embodiment of Fig. 1 liquid is gravity fed from the reservoir 1 and the licking plate L actuates valve 12 against spring means 7. Alternatively, a double poppet valve may be employed acting directly against spring means and controlling the supply to and from a measuring chamber. In a preferred embodiment, Fig. 4, the appliance is enclosed within a supply tank 36. Depression of the licking plate causes a flexible chamber in the form of a tube 25<SP>1</SP> to bear against an anvil 56 forcing liquid through valve 38<SP>1</SP> and displacing some on to the plate surface 48 via control orifice 47<SP>1</SP>. Releasing the pressure causes more liquid to enter the tube via filter 44 and valve 39<SP>1</SP>. This embodiment may be attached by brackets to an external supply pipe. In another embodiment, the flexible tube is vertically disposed for compression by a lever actuated by the licking plate.",FEED SERVICE LIVESTOCK,CLARK KENNETH GOULD;;KEMP DAVID CHARLES,,https://lens.org/031-639-484-029-493,Granted Patent,no,0,3,4,4,0,A01K5/0216;;A01K5/0216;;A01K7/022;;A01K7/022;;F16H31/00;;F16H31/00,A01K5/02;;A01K7/02;;F16H31/00,A1M M11           -;;F1A A1C1          -;;F1A A3C           -;;F1A A4S2          -;;F1W WCL           WCL;;F1W W100          WCL;;F1W W220          WCL;;F1W W508          WCL,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Type writers.- Relates to improvements in typewheel machines. The type-wheel F' is carried on a shaft f, of which the central portion is formed as an elongated pinion F<2>. The shaft is journalled in a framework E, pivoted on a rockshaft D<1>, and normally held upwards by a spring D<4>. The key levers H, Fig. 4, are pivoted on two shafts at the sides of the framework, and are furnished with segmental racks H<4>, which engage the pinion F<2> when the keys G, Figs. 4 and 5, are depressed. The extensions H<@> of the racks engage with stops I, which thus determine the movements of the type-wheel. Further pressure on the keys causes the frame E to swing downwards so as to bring the type-wheel to the impression-point. A shift-key J' is adapted to move the shaft f longitudinally against the tension of the spring J when printing capitals. The escapement-dogs C<1> which engage with the carriage feed-rack C are carried by a plate C<5> supported on the rock-shaft C3, which is adapted to be rocked either by a special spacekey C<2>, or by means of a spring bar C<7> when the frame E is depressed. The inking-roll K<2> is carried by a lever K pivoted at K<1>. The lever K is engaged by the end of the shaft f as it descends, and the roll inks the type as it moves back out of the way of the type-wheel.",FERGUSON ARTHUR CLARK;;SMITH CHARLES EMANUEL,FERGUSON ARTHUR CLARK;;SMITH CHARLES EMANUEL,,https://lens.org/133-909-442-472-45X,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   A slip-on footwear system including an upper that defines an elasticized gore in the heel portion of the footwear. In the heel portion of the footwear, one or more upper panels cooperate to define a recess, also referred to as a gore, which is bounded by a perimeter. An elastic panel is secured along the perimeter and cooperates with the one or more upper panels to further define an opening through which a foot is inserted into the upper. The elastic panel is stretchable and resilient so that when a user inserts their foot into the footwear, the gore opens-up, which in turn enlarges the opening. A heel flap may be secured to the upper panels in the heel region below the gore to conceal the gore and elastic panel, without inhibiting the stretch of the elastic panel. The heel flap may also add structural rigidity to the footwear.

Clark, H. C., and Goddard, J. W. May 30. Spray carburettors. - A suction - actuated cylindrical piston-valve controls air ports in the carburettor casing, and carries a cap which controls fuel from a series of orifices in a coaxial fuel-nozzle. The casing A is jacketed at A<2> and has air ports A<4> which are controlled by ports in the trunk J' of the piston J. The piston slides over a rod D<2> which may be rotated, to vary the proportion of air to fuel, by turning the ring D. The trunk J<1> supports, by means of ribs J<5>, a cap K which controls the fuel-orifices. These are formed by a series of perforated disks G, Fig. 5, in which a slot G<2> connects one or more of the holes G<1> with the outer edge of the disk. The plates are kept in position so .that no two adjacent orifices coincide by means of a'rod H, and fuel flows to the orifices through passages E<1> formed in the nozzle body. A bolt F clamps the disks together. Air is admitted to the cap K by a passage L and an annular groove J<6> communicating with the port A<4>. Mixture is controlled by the throttle B. Air, entering through a small hole in the casing, and fuel from orifices that are always uncovered, serve to keep the engine running slowly. Fuel is filtered by gauze or felt P<3> in the float-chamber, the arm Q of which engages a hollow stud R screwed into the base of the carburettor.
