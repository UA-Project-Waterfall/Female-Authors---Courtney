The method comprises the following steps: carrying out bubbling reaction on the emission tail gas and an alkaline ammonia water solution to prepare an ammonium bicarbonate mixed solution; leading out the ammonium bicarbonate mixed solution to react with sulfuric acid to generate carbon dioxide and reaction mixed solution; carrying out membrane desorption on the reaction mixed solution to generate an intercepted carbon dioxide and ammonium sulfate mixed solution, and collecting and storing carbon dioxide through vacuumizing or gas purging; the ammonium sulfate mixed solution is converted into sulfuric acid and ammonia water through bipolar membrane electrodialysis, and the ammonia water and the sulfuric acid participate in circulation. The method meets the requirement for efficient carbon dioxide recovery, can achieve efficient circulation of sulfuric acid and ammonia water, reduces the carbon dioxide recovery cost, and maintains stable and efficient operation of the recovery operation. The front-end bubbling reaction is combined with the rear-end sulfuric acid participation reaction, so that the recovery rate of carbon dioxide is increased, and high economic value is achieved. The system utilizes waste heat, effectively reduces the reaction energy consumption of the system, and is particularly suitable for recovery of tail gas discharged by a power plant.",SUZHOU CPS TECH CO LTD,JOSEPH;;LIU FANGRONG;;CHEN CHENG,,https://lens.org/188-857-824-380-394,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,B01D53/62;;B01D53/78;;B01D53/96;;B01D2257/504,B01D53/62;;B01D53/78;;B01D53/96,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Similar steps are then performed for a second multicast packet.",FORTINET INC,CHENG JOSEPH;;HUSSAIN ZAHID;;MILLET TIM,,https://lens.org/104-691-810-322-148,Granted Patent,yes,278,0,14,14,0,H04L45/38;;H04L45/60;;H04L45/16;;H04L49/201;;H04L45/38;;H04L45/60;;H04L47/10;;H04L45/16;;H04L12/18;;H04L12/1886;;H04L45/586;;H04L45/745;;H04L69/22;;H04L2012/6489,H04L12/18;;H04L12/64;;H04L45/16;;H04L45/586;;H04L45/74,,121,6,033-872-201-622-427;;133-989-378-755-131;;087-295-930-837-155;;160-968-204-060-619;;108-752-904-957-402;;053-903-146-520-405,10.1145/378956.378963;;10.1007/978-0-387-35180-3_23;;10.1109/noms.1996.539388;;10.1109/inm.1999.770683;;10.17487/rfc2892;;10.1109/mwscas.1994.519194,"Notice of Allowance for U.S. Appl.

   A packet-forwarding engine (PFE) of a multiprocessor system uses an array of flow classification block (FCB) indices to multicast a packet. Packets are received and buffered in external memory. In one embodiment, when a multicast packet is identified, a bit is set in a packet descriptor and an FCB index is generated and sent with a null-packet to the egress processors which generate multiple descriptors with different indices for each instance of multicasting. All the descriptors may point to the same buffer in the external memory, which stores the multicast packet. A DMA engine reads from the same buffer multiple times and egress processors may access an appropriate transform control block (TCB) index so that the proper headers may be installed on the outgoing packet. The buffer may be released after the last time the packet is read by setting a particular bit of the FCB index.

A sample of fluid is heated to an elevated temperature, a measurement is taken of an electrical characteristic of the fluid at that first temperature, the fluid is further heated and a measurement is again taken. The two measured values of the electrical characteristic are used to calculate a quality parameter, which when compared to quality parameter values corresponding to fluid samples of varying condition, gives an estimate of the relative condition of the fluid sample under test. The test procedure also includes a measurement of the opacity of the fluid sample to visible light which permits a more accurate measure of the fluid condition.

Information describing a network topology of a network is obtained, with the network topology being nodes each connected by an edge to other nodes, each node being associated with a compromise likelihood, and one or more nodes are high value nodes associated with a compromise value. Unique paths to each of the high value nodes are determined for a particular user account. An expected value for each path is determined based on the compromise likelihood of the particular user account, the compromise likelihood of each node included in the path, the communication weight of each edge included in the path, and the compromise value associated with the high value node. User interface data is generated describing at least one path.",PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES INC;;PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES INC,JONES SAMUEL;;STAEHLE JOSEPH;;CHENG LUCY,PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES INC (2017-01-16),https://lens.org/064-904-592-409-76X,Granted Patent,yes,159,70,4,4,0,G06F21/577;;H04L63/1425;;H04L63/1433;;H04L63/1433;;H04L63/102;;H04L63/107;;G06F21/55;;H04L63/14;;H04L63/1425;;G06F21/577,G06F21/55;;H04L29/06,,56,6,038-546-354-046-377;;107-007-514-420-865;;033-397-965-818-788;;020-629-732-499-26X;;076-685-583-160-315;;031-248-117-427-563,22962466;;pmc3436816;;10.1093/bioinformatics/bts389;;10.1038/nprot.2008.211;;19131956;;19188191;;pmc2654801;;10.1093/bioinformatics/btp049;;10.1145/1502777.1502779;;10.1007/3-540-62494-5_15;;10.1093/nar/gkn276;;18487275;;pmc2447756,"Baker et al., “The Development of a Common Enumeration of Vulnerabilities and Exposures,” Presented at the Second International Workshop on Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection, Sep. 7-9, 1999, pp. 35.;;Bhuyan et al., “Network Anomaly Detection: Methods, Systems and Tools,” First Quarter 2014, IEEE.;;Crosby et al., “Efficient Data Structures for Tamper-Evident Logging,” Department of Computer Science, Rice University, 2009, pp. 17.;;FireEye—Products and Solutions Overview, http://www.fireeye.com/products-and-solutions Printed Jun. 30, 2014 in 3 pages.;;FireEye, http://www.fireeye.com, Printed Jun. 30, 2014 in 2 pages.;;Glaab et al., “EnrichNet: Network-Based Gene Set Enrichment Analysis,” Bioinformatics 28.18 (2012): pp. i451-i457.;;Huang et al., “Systematic and Integrative Analysis of Large Gene Lists Using DAVID Bioinformatics Resources,” Nature Protocols, 4.1, 2008, 44-57.;;Hur et al., “SciMiner: web-based literature mining tool for target identification and functional enrichment analysis,” Bioinformatics 25.6 (2009): pp. 838-840.;;Lee et al., “A Data Mining and CIDF Based Approach for Detecting Novel and Distributed Intrusions,” Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 1907 Nov. 11, 2000, pp. 49-65.;;Ma et al., “A New Approach to Secure Logging,” ACM Transactions on Storage, vol. 5, No. 1, Article 2, Published Mar. 2009, 21 pages.;;Schneier et al., “Automatic Event Stream Notarization Using Digital Signatures,” Security Protocols, International Workshop Apr. 1996 Proceedings, Springer-Veriag, 1997, pp. 155-169, https://schneier.com/paper-event-stream.pdf.;;Schneier et al., “Cryptographic Support for Secure Logs on Untrusted Machines,” The Seventh USENIX Security Symposium Proceedings, USENIX Press, Jan. 1998, pp. 53-62, https://www.schneier.com/paper-secure-logs.pdf.;;VirusTotal—About, http://www.virustotal.com/en/about/ Printed Jun. 30, 2014 in 8 pages.;;Waters et al., “Building an Encrypted and Searchable Audit Log,” Published Jan. 9, 2004, 11 pages, http://www.parc.com/content/attachments/building_encrypted_searchable_5059_parc.pdf.;;Zheng et al., “GOEAST: a web-based software toolkit for Gene Ontology enrichment analysis,” Nucleic acids research 36.suppl 2 (2008): pp. W385-W363.;;Notice of Allowance for U.S. Appl.

The increased bias current causes the LNA (50) to operate in a highly linear mode and it is thus less susceptible to cross modulation when transmitting at high power in the presence of a high power 'jammer'. Since the high bias current level only exists when the transmitter is on (transmitting), current drain on the battery is reduced thus increasing standby time and talk time. In a preferred embodiment, a signal indicative of the state of the transceiver's transmitter causes a switch (Q24) to close only when the transmitter is transmitting, thereby inserting a resister (R12) in parallel with a biasing resister (R11) and raising the bias current of the low noise amplifier.",QUALCOMM INC,CAREY JOSEPH M;;TAN CHENG FONG,,https://lens.org/127-441-132-988-313,Patent Application,yes,2,4,3,3,0,H04B1/109,H04B1/10;;H04B1/16,,0,0,,,,PENDING

A thermoelectric cooling module is integrated with an ejector cooling device so that heat from the thermoelectric cooling module is rejected to a high temperature evaporator of the ejector cooling device. This provides for a total COP greater than the sum of the COPs of the thermoelectric cooling module and ejector cooling device individually. For example, given 1 unit input power into the thermoelectric cooling module, the heat received by the cold side of the thermoelectric cooling module would be COP TEC ×1; and the energy rejected by the hot side of the thermoelectric cooling module and to drive the ejector cooling device would be COP TEC +1. Thus, the cooling received by the low temperature evaporator of the ejector cooling device is COP EJ ×(COP TEC +1); and therefore total COP TE-Ej-AC is COP Ej +COP TEC +COP Ej ×COP TEC . In addition, the hybrid thermoelectric ejector active cooling system will be able to operate at higher temperature differentials than standalone thermoelectric cooling devices.",MA HONGBIN;;CHENG PENG;;BOSWELL JOSEPH A;;UNIV MISSOURI,MA HONGBIN;;CHENG PENG;;BOSWELL JOSEPH A,THE CURATORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI (2021-02-26),https://lens.org/062-228-940-798-48X,Granted Patent,yes,39,7,2,2,0,F25B21/02;;F28D15/043;;F25B21/02;;F28D15/043,F28D15/00;;F25B21/02,62/3.2;;62/3.7;;165/104.26,7,4,106-474-841-072-278;;050-722-845-916-116;;061-792-876-008-121;;060-774-730-605-059,10.2514/1.23263;;10.1115/1.4002726;;10.1080/10893950290098340;;10.1115/1.3072953,"Borgmeyer, B. et al., Experimental Investigation of Oscillating Motions in a Flat Plate Pulsating Heat Pipe, Journal of Thermophysics and Heat Transfer, vol. 21, No. 2, Apr.-Jun. 2007, pp. 405-409.;;Cheng, Peng et al., An Investigation of Flat-Plate Oscillating Heat Pipes, ASME Journal of Electronic Packaging, vol. 132, No. 4 041009, Dec. 2010, 20 pgs.;;Khandekar, S. et al., Thermofluid Dynamic Study of Flat-Plate Closed-Loop Pulsating Heat Pipes, Microscale Thermophysical Engineering, 6:303-317 (2002), 15 pgs.;;Thompson, S.

The configuration memory of one of the components may be designated as a master global configuration for all of the components. A module coupled to the interconnect may receive writes to the components from a configuration source. For each write, the module may decode the write to determine addressing information and check to see if the write is addressed to the master global configuration.

Since the optical addressing is time-multiplexed, only N addressing lines are required for an N.times.N crossbar, rather than the N.sup.2 lines needed in the prior art. This reduction in addressing lines makes possible the development of enormous crossbar switches, such as 100.times.100, for the first time. In addition, since data paths remain entirely in the optics domain, data speeds can reach the multi-gigabit level. In the switch, a row (40) of N inputs (42) at the ""read"" wavelength is spread over one axis of the O-SLM. The light is refocused along the other axis to an output array (48) of detectors (50), so that each input has the potential to talk to any one output. The O-SLM is normally off, i.e., non-reflective, so that the output is, in the absence of an input signal, zero. A one-dimensional array (52) of lasers (54) at the ""write"" wavelength is imaged onto the O-SLM. Each laser scans across an entire row of the O-SLM; where the laser is on, it turns on a portion of the O-SLM and establishes a connection between a particular input and a particular output. A full row is scanned in a time much shorter than the response time of the O-SLM, so that state of the O-SLM is capacitively stored and dynamically refreshed. The scanning is accomplished by tuning the wavelength of the laser and passing it through a grating, which sweeps the beam in space.",CALIFORNIA INST OF TECHN,LANG ROBERT J;;CHENG LI-JEN;;MASERJIAN JOSEPH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (1993-02-25),https://lens.org/121-035-163-012-362,Granted Patent,yes,5,29,1,1,0,H04Q11/0001;;H04Q11/0001,H04Q11/00,359/139;;359/117;;385/17,1,1,106-426-258-976-011,10.1117/12.57683,"A.

The organophosphorus hydrolase enzyme is purified by contacting an aqueous solution of cell free bacterial proteins with a strong cation exchange resin, the aqueous solution comprising soluble organophosphorus hydrolase enzyme, washing the strong cation exchange resin with a washing buffer to remove unbound proteins from the strong cation exchange resin, eluting proteins that remain bound to the strong cation exchange resin by washing the resin with an eluting buffer comprising salt in a concentration that starts at about zero and is raised during the eluting process to about 0.5M, and detecting and collecting eluate comprising a protein having organophosphorus hydrolase enzyme activity. All processing steps are conducted at a pH that is less than the isoelectric point of the organophosphorus hydrolase enzyme.

    A resonant converter which may be employed as an electronic ballast for a gas discharge lamp, the converter being in the form of a full or half bridge circuit which includes at least a pair of power switches such as MOSFET's. The gates of the switches are actuated by substantially square wave cyclic gating signals having complementary duty cycle ratios and a frequency somewhat above a resonant frequency of the converter circuit. The energy supply to the lamp is variable in accordance with the duty cycle ratios of the gating signals. In order to avoid generation of high voltage and current transients in the converter when a change in operating state requiring a substantial change in duty cycle ratios of the gating signals is to be performed, as when effecting turn-on or turn-off of the lamp, the changes in the duty cycle ratio are ramped to occur incrementally over several cycles of the gating signals rather than directly to required final values of the duty cycle ratios.

Error detection logic identifies errors in the entries read from CAM array (using the retrieved error detection bits). If these errors are correctable, the error detection logic corrects the entry, and writes the corrected entry back to the CAM array (an updated set of error detection bits are also written to the non-CAM array).

Characterization of these oligomers by infrared spectroscopy and .sup.1 H NMR supports the assigned structures. Because of the predominant 1,6-arrangement of double bonds in these oligomers, they have a propensity to undergo cyclopolymerization as well as the usual crosslinking associated with the free radical polymerization of multifunctional monomers and oligomers.

The polypeptide antigens of the subject invention can provide the basis of a diagnostic assay that would allow the rapid, in-house, laboratory diagnosis of infection with Candida and/or Aspergillus using a sample (e.g., serum, plasma, or whole blood) from an infected human or animal. Additionally, the subject invention provides methods of detecting the presence of Candida albicans and/or Aspergillus fumigatus in biological or environmental samples utilizing antibodies provided by the subject invention. Furthermore, the use of single antigens or, more preferably, one or more groups (sets) of antigens of the invention in the diagnosis of these important diseases offers many advantages including enhanced test specificity, ease of testing and consistency of results using synthetically or recombinantly produced test antigens instead of cultured, whole organisms. In one embodiment, the group of antigens comprises or consists of one or more polypeptides (e.g., one, two, three, or four or more antigens) selected from among SET1 (chromatin regulatory protein), ENO1 (enolase I), PGK1-2 (phosphoglycerate kinease), and MUC1-2 (cell surface glycoprotein).

In the projection method, an infrared vision domain processor of a detection module is electrically connected with an infrared projector and an image receiver. The infrared projector is used to project invisible infrared light onto the projection screen. The image receiver captures an image of infrared light. Furthermore, the infrared vision domain processor performs image processing of texture analysis on the received image of infrared light, so as to separate two regions for obtaining a profile of the presenter and conducting a comparison to find a geometric figure region, which is then transmitted to a computer. After the computer performs dark processing on the geometric figure region of the projection data, the projector is employed to project such that the dark geometric figure region in the image screen is exactly aligned with the face of the presenter, thereby allowing the presenter to look squarely at the participants in front without being stimulated by blaze. The detection module also can continuously detect the position of the presenter, so as to allow the dark processed position to move according to the position of the presenter, thereby increasing the smoothness, clarity, comfort and suitability for a conference.",OPHAYA ELECTRONICS CORP,CHIEN CHENG-CHIH;;CHIEN I-RONG;;LEE SI-KEN;;CHENG CHIH-YUNG;;CHIEN JOSEPH,,https://lens.org/191-100-366-758-778,Patent of Addition,no,0,0,1,1,0,,G03B21/00;;G03B21/26;;H04N5/74,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The voice processing method comprises the following steps. Barcode data is retrieved from a learning paper by a reading head and transmitted to a microprocessor for comparison. A sounding module is then allowed to speed out question voice. The microprocessor makes an analog-to-digital conversion of answer voice spoken by a user and picked up by a microphone, and the digital voice data are compared to an internal keyword voice list for obtaining accuracy degree. The digital voice data are then subjected to framing, end point detection, characteristic retrieval, and dynamic time correction matching to obtain similarity degree. With such comparison, grading voice data can be obtained to allow the sounding module to speak out the grading voice. Since the use is constrained to pick up one of a plurality of answers from the learning paper for speaking out the answer, the range required for voice identification can be reduced, allowing the operation to be carried out with a low level microprocessor. Further, due to being capable of speaking out quantitative grading voice, the purposes of reducing product manufacturing cost and improving pronunciation of the user can be achieved.",OPHAYA ELECTRONICS CORP,CHIEN CHENG-CHIH;;CHIEN I-RONG;;LEE SI-KEN;;CHENG CHIH-YUNG;;CHIEN JOSEPH,,https://lens.org/125-652-669-224-660,Patent of Addition,no,0,2,1,1,0,,G09B7/06;;G06F3/01;;G10L15/10,,0,0,,,,PENDING

   A disc drive includes a transducer having a separate element for writing information and a separate element for reading information to and from the disc. In a disc drive designated to read and write long sequential records, the track misregistration budget is reduced to account for previously written tracks not being encroached on one side. An initial track is written. Subsequent tracks are written after a seek in one direction. The subsequent track is written so that the initially written track is overwritten to one side and leaves a track having a width substantially equal to the width of the read element. Records can be written into data bands of a selected number of tracks. A guard band is left between groups of data bands so that data on tracks in subsequent data bands are not overwritten.

   A virtual routing platform includes a line interface a plurality of virtual routing engines (VREs) to identify packets of different packet flows and perform a hierarchy of metering including at least first and second levels of metering on the packet flows. A first level of metering may be performed on packets of a first packet flow using a first metering control block (MCB). The first level of metering may be one level of metering in a hierarchy of metering levels. A second level of metering on the packets of the first packet flow and packets of a second flow using a second MCB. The second level of metering may be another level of metering in the hierarchy. A cache-lock may be placed on the appropriate MCB prior to performing the level of metering. The first and second MCBs may be data structures stored in a shared memory of the virtual routing platform. The cache-lock may be released after performing the level of metering using the MCB. The cache-lock may comprise setting a lock-bit of a cache line index in a cache tag store, which may identify a MCB in the cache memory. The virtual routing platform may be a multiprocessor system utilizing a shared memory having a first and second processors to perform levels of metering in parallel. In one embodiment, a virtual routing engine may be shared by a plurality of virtual router contexts running in a memory system of a CPU of the virtual routing engine. In this embodiment, the first packet flow may be associated with one virtual router context and the second packet flow is associated with a second virtual router context. The first and second routing contexts may be of a plurality of virtual router contexts resident in the virtual routing engine.

   The techniques described employ a cooperative organization of network service providers to provide improved distributed network services. The network service providers that are constituent to the cooperative organization represent various perspectives within the overall Internet content distribution network, and may include network owners, telecommunications carriers, network access providers, hosting providers and distribution network owners, the latter being an entity that caches content at a plurality of locations distributed on the network. Aspects include managing content caches by receiving control signals specifying actions related to cached content that is distributed on a network, such as the Internet, and forwarding the control signals through to the caching locations to implement the actions represented by the control signals, thus providing content publishers the capability of refreshing their content regardless of where it is cached. Aspects include managing content caches by receiving activity records that contain statistics related to requests for cached content, segregating the statistics according to which content publisher provides the content associated with the statistics, and providing to each content publisher statistics corresponding to content provided by that content publisher, thus allowing them to monitor requests for their content regardless of where it may be cached on the network.

    An HDA includes a base, a disc stack coupled to a spindle rotatably attached to the base by a spindle shaft and spindle bearing. An actuator assembly is pivotally attached to the base at a pivot shaft. Attached to one end of the actuator assembly proximal the disc stack is one or more transducers for reading/writing information from/to the discs. A servo writer includes a controller for moving the actuator during the servo writing process. The controller moves the servo writer at the cage frequency of the spindle bearing to lessen the relative motion between the transducer head and the disc as the servo information is written to the disc. The controller also may be programmed to move the transducer at both the spindle rotation frequency and the cage frequency of the spindle bearing to lessen the relative motion between the transducer and the disc during the servo writing process.

An initial track is written. Subsequent tracks are written after a seek in one direction. The subsequent track is written so that the initially written track is overwritten to one side and leaves a track having a width substantially equal to the width of the read element.

Once a set of Mobile IP keys is generated from authentication information associated with the IMSI, the Mobile Node may register with its Home Agent using the set of Mobile IP keys.",CISCO TECH INC,PATEL ALPESH S;;LEUNG KENT K;;SALOWEY JOSEPH A;;SHAO YU-CHENG,CISCO TECHNOLOGY INC (2005-10-19),https://lens.org/113-645-132-046-293,Granted Patent,yes,74,28,11,11,0,H04L63/0853;;H04L63/0892;;H04L63/162;;H04L2463/061;;H04W8/04;;H04W80/04;;H04L9/083;;H04L9/0844;;H04L2209/80;;H04W12/069;;H04W12/068;;H04L63/162;;H04W8/04;;H04L63/0892;;H04L2463/061;;H04L63/0853;;H04W80/04;;H04L9/083;;H04L2209/80;;H04L9/0844;;H04W12/068;;H04W12/069,H04W4/00;;H04W8/04;;H04W12/06;;H04W80/04,370/331;;370/338;;370/351;;455/419;;455/432.1;;455/432.3;;455/433;;455/435.1;;455/435.2;;455/436;;455/41.2;;455/41.3,64,25,105-857-480-043-739;;158-327-259-258-364;;049-314-615-522-949;;111-591-844-562-778;;180-392-925-021-253;;012-219-606-350-833;;056-642-228-577-612;;123-550-389-107-013;;132-068-983-186-966;;180-716-866-790-447;;166-160-018-622-530;;000-602-363-680-104;;101-772-233-660-416;;103-633-101-486-340;;132-805-152-294-496;;014-605-549-640-567;;045-520-254-929-197;;149-909-052-318-626;;114-888-416-599-343;;179-029-674-260-951;;194-101-880-058-735;;103-497-774-754-449;;146-627-250-647-071;;078-988-554-440-239;;135-149-686-486-763,10.17487/rfc1492;;10.17487/rfc2002;;10.17487/rfc3220;;10.17487/rfc3344;;10.17487/rfc3012;;10.17487/rfc2138;;10.17487/rfc2139;;10.17487/rfc2006;;10.17487/rfc2409;;10.17487/rfc1142;;10.17487/rfc3115;;10.17487/rfc2548;;10.17487/rfc2759;;10.17487/rfc1510;;10.17487/rfc1247;;10.1109/ispan.1999.778965;;10.17487/rfc2344;;10.17487/rfc2281;;10.17487/rfc2865;;10.17487/rfc2794;;10.17487/rfc2541;;10.17487/rfc3775;;10.17487/rfc3588;;10.17487/rfc3957;;10.1109/icc.2001.936589,"European Office Action, dated Sep. 6, 2006, from corresponding European Patent Application No. 03 789 813.7, 5 pages.;;International Search Report dated Jun. 18, 2004 from related International Application No. PCT/US 03/36850.;;U.S. Office Action mailed Jul. 3, 2007 from U.S. Appl.
