    A power management architecture for an electrical power distribution system, or portion thereof, is disclosed. The architecture includes intelligent electronic devices (IED's) with the capability to monitor and control attached slave devices, and provide capability to communicate between multiple devices in a variety of communication protocols. A master IED in the master/slave architecture performs power management functions on the data received from the slave IED's. Further, the IED's with master functionality provide web server capabilities, allowing a user to view processed data over an open Internet protocol, such as HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).

   A power management architecture for an electrical power distribution system, or portion thereof, is disclosed. The architecture includes multiple intelligent electronic devices (IED's) distributed throughout the power distribution system to manage the flow and consumption of power from the system. The IED's are linked via a network to back-end servers. Power management application software and/or hardware components operate on the IED's and the back-end servers and inter-operate via the network to implement a power management application. The architecture provides a scalable and cost effective framework of hardware and software upon which such power management applications can operate to manage the distribution and consumption of electrical power by one or more utilities/suppliers and/or customers which provide and utilize the power distribution system. In particular, each IED is capable of incrementally generated or consuming communicated XML documents containing power management data without having to buffer the complete XML document is memory before, during or after processing.

   A power management architecture for an electrical power distribution system, or portion thereof, is disclosed. The architecture includes intelligent electronic devices (IED's) with the capability to monitor and control attached slave devices, and provide capability to communicate between multiple devices in a variety of communication protocols. A master IED in the master/slave architecture performs power management functions on the data received from the slave IED's. Further, the IED's with master functionality provide web server capabilities, allowing a user to view processed data over an open Internet protocol, such as HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).

   A power management architecture for an electrical power distribution system, or portion thereof, is disclosed. The architecture includes multiple intelligent electronic devices (IED's) distributed throughout the power distribution system to manage the flow and consumption of power from the system using real time communications. Power management application software and/or hardware components operate on the IED's and the back-end servers and inter-operate via the network to implement a power management application. The architecture provides a scalable and cost effective framework of hardware and software upon which such power management applications can operate to manage the distribution and consumption of electrical power by one or more utilities/suppliers and/or customers which provide and utilize the power distribution system. Autonomous communication on the network between IED's, back-end servers and other entities coupled with secure networks, themselves interconnected, via firewalls, by one or more unsecure networks, is facilitated by the use of a back-channel protocol. The back-channel protocol allows a device coupled with a secure network to solicit communications from a device on the unsecure network, thereby opening a back-channel through the firewall through which the unsecure network device may send unsolicited messages to the secure network device. Communications between multiple secure networks is accomplished using a unsecure device on an intermediary unsecure network to relay communications between the secure network devices using the protocol described above.

The architecture includes multiple intelligent electronic devices (旜IED&rsquo;s&rdquo;) distributed throughout the power distribution system to manage the flow and consumption of power from the system. The IED&rsquo;s are linked via a network to back-end servers. Security mechanisms are further provided which protect and otherwise ensure the authenticity of communications transmitted via the network in furtherance of the management of the distribution and consumption of electrical power by the architecture. In particular, public key cryptography is employed to identify components of the architecture and provide for secure communication of power management data among those components.
