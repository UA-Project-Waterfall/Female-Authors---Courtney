The salt water is the result of killing the well with fresh water during pump installation and/or removal operations at which time the water enters the CO.sub.2 producing formation and dissolves soluble salts which come into the well when the kill water returns to the well when it is put on production. Precipitation of salts carried by the kill water in the pump is prevented by continuously injecting water into the vicinity of the pump intake so as to dilute the returning kill water before it, or at least a portion of it, is vaporized into the water phase of the supercritical carbon dioxide. The volume of injected, substantially fresh water must be sufficient to handle the vaporization of water into the carbon dioxide in the pump as well as dilute the returning kill water so that the salts carried thereby remain in solution.",SHELL WESTERN E & P INC,WALHAUG WARREN W;;NEELY AARON B;;MOORE BOYD B,SHELL WESTERN E&P INC.
