    A direct access storage device (DASD) employs head-specific off-track read capability (OTRC) in data access operations. A method of operation of the DASD involves providing within the DASD a rotating data storage medium and one or more read heads positionable for interaction with the data storage medium. The OTRC particular to each read head is determined and then applied in accessing data from the data storage medium. One manner of applying the OTRC to access data is to use the OTRC in scheduling random queued seeks. The OTRC for a head is referenced within buffer memory and applied to determine which target data can be accessed most quickly. The seeks are scheduled accordingly. A single table with a nominal seek time can be used for all heads, with a custom adder being added for each particular head. The OTRC can also be applied to alter the seek algorithm. That is, a given seek operation can be conducted more aggressively where the head involved has more favorable OTRC and less aggressively where a head with a less favorable OTRC is involved.

   A design interface tool for designing force sensations for use with a host computer and force feedback interface device. A force feedback device is connected to a host computer that displays the interface tool. Input from a user is received in the interface to select a type of force sensation to be commanded by a host computer and output by a force feedback interface device. Input, such as parameters, is then received from the user which designs and defines physical characteristics of the selected force sensation. A graphical representation of the characterized force sensation is displayed on the host computer which provides a visual demonstration of a feel of the characterized force sensation so that the user can view an effect of parameters on said force sensation. The characterized force sensation is output to a user manipulatable object of the force feedback device so that the user can feel the designed force sensation, where the graphical representation is updated in conjunction with the output of the force sensation. The user can iteratively modify force sensation characteristics and feel the results, and store the characterized force sensations.

   A design interface tool for designing force sensations for use with a host computer and force feedback interface device. A force feedback device is connected to a host computer that displays the interface tool. Input from a user is received in the interface to select a type of force sensation to be commanded by a host computer and output by a force feedback interface device. Input, such as parameters, is then received from the user which designs and defines physical characteristics of the selected force sensation. A graphical representation of the characterized force sensation is displayed on the host computer which provides a visual demonstration of a feel of the characterized force sensation so that the user can view an effect of parameters on said force sensation. The characterized force sensation is output to a user manipulatable object of the force feedback device so that the user can feel the designed force sensation, where the graphical representation is updated in conjunction with the output of the force sensation. The user can iteratively modify force sensation characteristics and feel the results, and store the characterized force sensations.

A force feedback interface device is connected to a host computer that implements a graphical environment. The host sends commands and command parameters to the interface device to initiate and characterize dynamic force sensations output on a user manipulatable object, such as a joystick. The interface device can include a local microprocessor for implementing force sensations by controlling actuators and reading sensors according to the host commands. A dynamic force routine can control the dynamic force sensations by implementing a simulated physical system including a simulated mass capable of motion independent of the user object. The physical system provides forces on the user object influenced by motion of both the user object and the simulated mass.",IMMERSION CORP,ROSENBERG LOUIS B;;CHANG DEAN C,,https://lens.org/069-157-242-280-009,Granted Patent,yes,106,90,9,434,0,A63B24/00;;A63B24/00;;A63F2300/1025;;A63F2300/1025;;A63F2300/1037;;A63F2300/1037;;B25J9/1689;;B25J9/1689;;G06F3/016;;G06F3/016;;G05G9/047;;G05G9/047;;G05G2009/04766;;G05G2009/04766;;G05G2009/04777;;G05G2009/04777;;G06F3/03543;;G06F3/03543;;G06F3/038;;G06F3/038;;G06F3/0383;;G06F3/0383;;G06F2203/014;;G06F2203/014;;G06F2203/015;;G06F2203/015;;H01H2003/008;;H01H2003/008,G09G5/00;;A63B24/00;;B25J9/16;;G05G9/047;;G06F3/00;;G06F3/01;;G06F3/038,715/701;;715/702;;345/156,102,29,080-503-096-248-701;;039-844-983-507-166;;020-261-892-574-019;;009-861-761-390-026;;018-895-481-208-770;;055-438-619-225-257;;007-464-636-443-924;;040-180-978-427-467;;047-069-561-708-537;;162-468-356-701-202;;039-436-510-011-23X;;001-775-704-207-182;;039-844-983-507-166;;007-729-629-108-053;;007-797-333-936-671;;083-856-248-500-607;;006-872-496-451-40X;;092-099-379-035-574;;007-797-333-936-671;;006-872-496-451-40X;;083-856-248-500-607;;013-381-177-315-90X;;091-279-514-592-616;;043-826-256-949-123;;162-106-472-127-65X;;032-170-206-357-439;;015-174-320-162-928;;050-768-644-354-392;;072-956-596-118-526,10.1145/97880.97897;;10.1109/30.468083;;10.1109/vrais.1993.380767;;10.1109/robot.1993.292099;;10.23919/acc.1989.4790214;;10.1117/12.164928;;17775708;;10.1126/science.208.4450.1327;;10.1109/irsse.1992.671841;;10.1109/nebc.1988.19369;;10.1109/robot.1992.220166;;10.1109/vrais.1993.380778;;3680781;;10.1121/1.395260;;10.1109/30.468083;;10.1109/robot.1987.1087997;;10.1109/tmms.1970.299963;;10.1080/10447319509526107;;10.1162/pres.1995.4.4.387;;10.21236/ada206919;;10.1109/tmms.1970.299963;;10.1162/pres.1995.4.4.387;;10.1080/10447319509526107;;10.1109/iros.1992.594527;;10.1162/pres.1994.3.1.73;;10.1109/robot.1990.126037;;10.1162/pres.1992.1.1.18;;10.1109/vrais.1995.512499;;10.1109/vrais.1993.380777;;10.1145/319120.319127;;10.1109/21.97455,"Hiroo Iwata, ""Artificial Reality with Force-Feedback: Development of Desktop Virtual Space with Compact Master Manipulator"", Computer Graphics, vol. 24, No. 4, 1990, pp. 165-170.;;Ouhyoung et al., ""A Low-Cost Feedback Joystick and its use in PC Video Games"" IEEE Transactiopns o Consumer Electronics, vol. 41, No. 3,Aug. 1995 pp. 787-794.;;Kelley et al.

    A design interface tool for designing force sensations for use with a host computer and force feedback interface device. A force feedback device is connected to a host computer that displays the interface tool. Input from a user is received in the interface to select a type of force sensation to be commanded by a host computer and output by a force feedback interface device. Input, such as parameters, is then received from the user which designs and defines physical characteristics of the selected force sensation. A graphical representation of the characterized force sensation is displayed on the host computer which provides a visual demonstration of a feel of the characterized force sensation so that the user can view an effect of parameters on said force sensation. The characterized force sensation is output to a user manipulatable object of the force feedback device so that the user can feel the designed force sensation, where the graphical representation is updated in conjunction with the output of the force sensation. The user can iteratively modify force sensation characteristics and feel the results, and store the characterized force sensations.

An ink film composed of tin(II) carboxylate compound is applied to the surface and heated to partially decompose the tin compound. A positive photo-resist layer (16,18) is preferably applied to the partially decomposed layer (14) and selectively irradiated to define a mask (18) overlying the selected region. Unwanted photo-resist material is dissolved from the adjacent regions using an aqueous alkaline solution. It is found that the solution concurrently dissolves the underlying partially decomposed tin compound, without dissolving the tin compound protected by the mask (18). Thereafter, the mask (18) is removed, and the underlying tin compound is heated and further decomposed to produce the desired tin oxide thin film (22).

The device is coupled to a host computer that displays a cursor in a graphical environment, such as a GUI, on a display screen. A cursor position in the display frame is reported to the host computer derived from a reference position of the mouse in the local frame, and the host displays the cursor; for example, the cursor position may be scaled by a ballistics algorithm based on mouse velocity to allow fine positioning or coarse motion of the cursor. A force is output on the mouse based on interactions in the GUI, the force being determined based on mouse reference data or cursor ballistic data, depending on the type of force, to reduce distortion between visual and force outputs.

   A mouse interface device and method for providing enhanced cursor control and indexing cursor control with force feedback. A force feedback interface device includes a manipulandum, such as a mouse, that is moveable in a local workspace. The device is coupled to a host computer that displays a cursor in a graphical environment, such as a GUI, on a display screen. A cursor position in the display frame is reported to the host computer derived from a reference position of the mouse in the local frame, and the host displays the cursor; for example, the cursor position may be scaled by a ballistics algorithm based on mouse velocity to allow fine positioning or coarse motion of the cursor. A force is output on the mouse based on interactions in the GUI, the force being determined based on mouse reference data or cursor ballistic data, depending on the type of force, to reduce distortion between visual and force outputs. Assistive forces can alternatively be output to achieve the enhanced cursor control. Indexing features allow control of the cursor when an offset between local and display frames exists, allow the user to reduce the offset, and reduce disconcerting collisions of the mouse with physical workspace limits.

In one embodiment, a four-entry calendar structure provides for rate-limited weighted best effort scheduling. Each of a plurality of different flows has associated schedule control blocks. Schedule control blocks are stored as linked lists in a last-in-first-out buffer. Each calendar entry is associated with a different linked list by storing in the calendar entry the address of the first-out schedule control block in the linked list. Each schedule control block has a counter and is assigned a rate limit according to the bandwidth priority of the flow to which the corresponding packet belongs. Each time a schedule control block is accessed from a last-in-first-out buffer storing the linked list, the scheduler generates a scheduling event and the counter of the schedule control block is incremented. When an incremented counter of a schedule control block equals its rate limit, the schedule control block is temporarily removed from further scheduling until a time interval concludes.",IBM,BASSO CLAUDE;;CALVIGNAC JEAN LOUIS;;CHANG CHIH-JEN;;VAIDHYANATHAN NATARAJAN;;VERPLANKEN FABRICE JEAN,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (2005-04-28),https://lens.org/101-101-331-785-08X,Granted Patent,yes,19,2,2,2,0,H04L47/568;;H04L47/623;;H04L47/50;;H04L47/623;;H04L47/568;;H04L47/50,H04L12/56,370/395.41;;370/395.42;;370/412,2,1,054-366-661-983-047,10.1109/glocom.1998.775764,"Yuhua Chen, et al., ""Design of a Weighted Fair Queueing Cell Scheduler for ATM Netowrks,"" IEEE Globecom, 1998, pp. 405-410.;;A.

Level shifting of the ""off"" voltage applied to the gate electrode of the transfer gate transistor dynamically changes the gain of the cell transfer gate to increase memory cell stability without compromising the memory capacity per chip or read/write memory cycle time even though level shifting can greatly increase majority carrier density in the floating body (gate) of a SOICMOS transistor at a particular level shifted voltage range. Alternatively, or additionally, the discharge of deselected cells can be slowed to avoid instability by increasing resistance of the transistors in the data buffer (with saving of chip space) and/or increasing bit line capacitance by increasing bit line length (allowing increased memory array size or an additional cell array on a chip).",IBM,HSIEH CHANG-MING;;HSU LOUIS L;;MANDELMAN JACK A;;PELELLA MARIO M A,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (1996-06-19),https://lens.org/020-230-644-055-330,Granted Patent,yes,1,193,3,3,0,G11C11/419;;G11C11/417;;G11C7/12;;G11C7/1078;;G11C11/419,G11C11/419,365/230.06;;365/204;;365/156,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

When an incremented counter of a schedule control block equals its weight, the schedule control block is temporarily removed from further scheduling.",IBM,BASSO CLAUDE;;CALVIGNAC JEAN LOUIS;;CHANG CHIH-JEN;;VAIDHYANATHAN NATARAJAN;;VERPLANKEN FABRICE JEAN,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (2005-04-13),https://lens.org/099-623-156-683-649,Granted Patent,yes,18,41,2,2,0,H04L45/00;;H04L45/60;;H04L47/527;;H04L47/568;;H04L47/50;;H04L47/568;;H04L45/60;;H04L47/527;;H04L45/00;;H04L47/50,H04L12/28,370/351;;370/389;;370/395;;370/395.4;;370/395.41,2,1,006-651-841-892-283,10.1109/glocom.2000.891922,"Janevski, Toni et al, ""QoS Provisioning for Wireless IP Networks with Multiple Classes Through Flexible Fair Queuing,"" 2000 IEEE, pp. 1677-1681.;;Bass, Brian M., et al, U.S. Patent Application entitled ""Method and System for Network Processor Scheduling Outputs Using Queuing,"" filed Apr. 13, 2000, U.S. Appl.

A gate extends across the channel width between the first and second shallow trenches. The gate has a first length at the shallow trench edges and a second length less than the first length between the shallow trench edges. The first length and the second length are related such that the threshold voltage, V t , at the shallow trench edges is substantially equal to V t  between the shallow trench edges. The gate (14) is formed over a diffusion region (12) which serves as the source and drain of the FET device. The diffusion region is surrounded by an isolation region (13). The gate 14 is enlarged at either end so that the channel length is increased where the gate crosses over the diffusion edge. In a preferred embodiment, the isolation regions 13 comprises shallow trenches having a depth of between 0,1-0,5µm The gate structure of the FET device is produced using a unique phase shift mask that allows the manufacture of submicron FET devices with very small channel lengths.",IBM,HSIEH CHANG-MING;;HSU LOUIS LU-CHEN;;MANDELMAN JACK ALLAN;;LOGAN LYNDON RONALD;;OGURA SEIKI,,https://lens.org/089-736-150-534-878,Search Report,yes,1,0,6,6,0,H01L21/28123;;H01L29/4238;;H01L29/66575;;H01L29/7831;;H01L29/66575;;H01L21/28123;;H01L29/4238;;H01L29/7831,G03F1/08;;H01L21/027;;H01L21/28;;H01L21/336;;H01L21/76;;H01L29/423;;H01L29/78,,5,0,,,"PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN vol. 005, no. 197 (E - 086) 15 December 1981 (1981-12-15);;PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN vol. 010, no. 168 (E - 411) 14 June 1986 (1986-06-14);;PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN vol. 016, no. 526 (E - 1286) 28 October 1992 (1992-10-28);;W.

    Force feedback is provided to a user of a client computer receiving information such as a web page over a network such as the World Wide Web from a server machine. The client machine has a force feedback interface device through which the user experiences physical force feedback. The web page may include force feedback information to provide authored force effects. Force feedback is correlated to web page objects by a force feedback program running on the client and based on input information from the interface device, the web page objects, and the force feedback information. Generic force effects can also be provided, which are applied uniformly at the client machine to all web page objects of a particular type as defined by user preferences at the client machine. A web page authoring interface is also described that includes the ability to add force sensations to a web page. The user may assign force effects to web page objects and immediately feel how the web page will feel to an end user. A web page is output by the interface, including force information to provide the force effects at a client. The authoring tool can include or access a force design interface for creating or modifying force effects.

A force feedback interface device includes a manipulandum, such as a mouse, that is moveable in a local workspace. The device is coupled to a host computer that displays a cursor in a graphical environment, such as a GUI, on a display screen. An interior region and a border region in the local workspace is defined. One mapping of device movement to cursor movement is used for the interior region, and a different mapping is used for the border region. Mapping methods include ballistics, absolute, linear, rate control, and variable absolute. Rate control embodiments can be single axis or dual axis. In one embodiment, when the mouse moves from the interior region to the border region, the mapping providing the greater cursor velocity is used to better conserve device workspace in the direction of travel and to decrease any sense of mapping mode change to the user.

A force feedback interface device includes a manipulandum, such as a mouse, that is moveable in a local workspace. The device is coupled to a host computer that displays a cursor in a graphical environment, such as a GUI, on a display screen. An interior region and a border region in the local workspace is defined. One mapping of device movement to cursor movement is used for the interior region, and a different mapping is used for the border region.

   An interface device and method for providing enhanced cursor control with force feedback. A force feedback interface device includes a manipulandum, such as a mouse, that is moveable in a local workspace. The device is coupled to a host computer that displays a cursor in a graphical environment, such as a GUI, on a display screen. An interior region and a border region in the local workspace is defined. One mapping of device movement to cursor movement is used for the interior region, and a different mapping is used for the border region. Mapping methods include ballistics, absolute, linear, rate control, and variable absolute. Rate control embodiments can be single axis or dual axis. In one embodiment, when the mouse moves from the interior region to the border region, the mapping providing the greater cursor velocity is used to better conserve device workspace in the direction of travel and to decrease any sense of mapping mode change to the user. Other features include an autocentering function for reducing offset between local and host frames.

    An interface device and method for providing enhanced cursor control with force feedback. A force feedback interface device includes a manipulandum, such as a mouse, that is moveable in a local workspace. The device is coupled to a host computer that displays a cursor in a graphical environment, such as a GUI, on a display screen. An interior region and a border region in the local workspace is defined. One mapping of device movement to cursor movement is used for the interior region, and a different mapping is used for the border region. Mapping methods include ballistics, absolute, linear, rate control, and variable absolute. Rate control embodiments can be single axis or dual axis. In one embodiment, when the mouse moves from the interior region to the border region, the mapping providing the greater cursor velocity is used to better conserve device workspace in the direction of travel and to decrease any sense of mapping mode change to the user. Other features include an autocentering function for reducing offset between local and host frames.

Each display pixel may have a respective organic light-emitting diode that is controlled by a drive transistor. At low temperatures, it may be necessary to increase the amount of current through an organic light-emitting diode to achieve a desired luminance level. In order to increase the current through the light-emitting diode, the ground voltage level may be lowered. However, this may lead to thin-film transistors within the pixel leaking, which may result in undesirable display artifacts such as bright dots being displayed in a dark image. In order to prevent leakage in the transistors, the transistors may be coupled to separate reference voltage supplies or separate control lines.

Each display pixel may have a respective organic light-emitting diode that is controlled by a drive transistor. At low temperatures, it may be necessary to increase the amount of current through an organic light-emitting diode to achieve a desired luminance level. In order to increase the current through the light-emitting diode, the ground voltage level may be lowered. However, this may lead to thin-film transistors within the pixel leaking, which may result in undesirable display artifacts such as bright dots being displayed in a dark image. In order to prevent leakage in the transistors, the transistors may be coupled to separate reference voltage supplies or separate control lines. Additionally, the transistors may be positioned to minimize leakage even at low ground voltage levels.",APPLE INC,RIEUTORT-LOUIS WARREN S;;YAMASHITA KEITARO;;TSAI TSUNG-TING;;WANG YUN;;CHANG TING-KUO;;YU CHENG-HO;;ONO SHINYA,APPLE INC (2016-08-24),https://lens.org/173-672-372-422-788,Patent Application,yes,0,32,2,4,0,G09G3/3233;;G09G3/3233;;G09G3/3266;;G09G3/3266;;G09G2300/0819;;G09G2300/0819;;G09G2300/0842;;G09G2300/0842;;G09G2300/0861;;G09G2300/0861;;G09G2320/041;;G09G2320/041;;G09G2320/045;;G09G2320/045,G09G3/3233,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The ring maintains an optimal annular dimension to prevent excessive dilatation of the natural valve annulus while adapting to the dynamic motion of the tricuspid annulus during the cardiac cycle. An exemplary ring features a waveform contour and may be constructed of a titanium core having a varying cross-section for selective flexibility for good Z-axis or out-of plane movement. The “waveform” contour and selective flexibility of the different segments of this ring are designed to adapt to the complex motion of the annulus.

The ring maintains an optimal annular dimension to prevent excessive dilatation of the natural valve annulus while adapting to the dynamic motion of the tricuspid annulus during the cardiac cycle. An exemplary ring features a waveform contour and may be constructed of a titanium core having a varying cross-section for selective flexibility for good Z-axis or out-of plane movement. The “waveform” contour and selective flexibility of the different segments of this ring are designed to adapt to the complex motion of the annulus.

The connection requests are made by the calling subsystem to the called subsystem by sending a connect request message to the switch and queuing the connect request message in a buffer therein. The switch establishes a connection between the calling subsystem and the called subsystem by thereafter queuing the connect request message in a buffer in the called subsystem. Concurrently, the switch sends a connect request acknowledge message to the calling subsystem while the calling subsystem sends a connect request dequeue message to the switch. To prevent loss of synchronization between the calling subsystem and the switch, the connect request dequeue message received by the switch is interpreted as a disconnect request message and the connect request acknowledge message received by the calling subsystem is interpreted as a connect request dequeue acknowledge message.

The control messages which are coordinated by the sequencing scheme include connect and disconnect requests, connect and disconnect request acknowledgments, and data acknowledgments. All connect request and disconnect requests are managed by a connection processing (CP) bus, which operates as a circuit switching bus, and all data acknowledgments and connect request acknowledgments from subsystems attached to a cascaded switch are made over an out-of-band (OB) bus, which operates as a packet switching bus.

    Cross-linked toner resin having linear portions and cross-linked portions of high density microgel particles, where the toner resin is an unsaturated polyester resin, is prepared using a liquid chemical initiator such as 1,1-bis(t-butyl peroxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane so that the cross-linked resin achieved contains less than 0.20 percent by weight of acids. In particular, the cross-linked toner resin is free of benzoic acid. The method of making the cross-linked toner resin includes (a) spraying the liquid chemical initiator onto the unsaturated polyester resin prior to, during or subsequent to melting of the unsaturated polyester resin to form a polymer melt; and (b) subsequently cross-linking the polymer melt under high shear to form the cross-linked toner resin.

The low saturation in this layer provides void volume for the incoming insult as well, as a high permeability, thus increasing the intake rate of the absorbent system as a whole, but the structure of the low saturation layer is also balanced to provide an appropriately high level of capillary tension to provide enough control of the liquid to stop leakage from occurring. This low saturation layer is used in addition to a surge material and provides intake functionality in addition to that provided by the surge material. In particular aspects of the invention, the body side layer of the absorbent core does not extend over the entire surface of the overall absorbent core, therefore is not used as the high saturation, wicking layer, but as the intake layer. This arrangement also allows the intake layer to be in direct contact with the incoming liquid, therefore allowing for more immediate access and improved intake function.
