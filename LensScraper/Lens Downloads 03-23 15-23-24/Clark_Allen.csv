   This invention allows a common centrifugal blower (fan) to be used to produce cold air for comfort cooling purposes. It uses no chemicals, has no compressor, and does not require a drain since it produces no water while operating. It has been tested in my home, and was used to cool a large tent while family camping. It cooled the tent in 95 degree weather with excellent results. With the addition of the invention to a furnace blower, it can pre-cool air entering an existing conventional central air conditioning system and save energy, or the furnace blower itself could be used as the central air system. in the winter, for furnace heating use, one needs just block the resonator inlets and the blower functions as a normal blower. A smaller blower, like the prototype used for camping, is completely portable and does not need to occupy any windows, as in a window a/c unit. It is extremely environmentally friendly. I have searched the internet world-wide and have found nothing like this device anywhere.

The thin member  56  is mounted between the first  50  and second  54  structural members such that the sensor  58  is isolated from movements due to non-axial loads. The first  50  and second  54  structural members are inter-related to define a maximum range of movement between the first  50  and second  54  members. Thus, overload protection is provided to prevent separation of the first  50  and second  54  structural members when a predetermined load limit is exceeded.

The arrangement consists of a bridge having four legs. Input from telephone lines are fed into the bridge between two adjacent points (i.e. across one leg) of the bridge. The microphone is connected between one of the input points and a point opposite to the one input point. The legs on either side of the opposite point of the microphone connection contain equal impedances, and the fourth leg, between the input leg and one of the equal impedance legs, contains a variable impedance. To balance the bridge, the variable impedance is adjusted such that the microphone signal, appearing in opposite sides of the bridge, will be canceled out and thereby prevented from exiting on the speaker circuits. However, because of the imbalance relative thereto, the microphone signal will be passed up the telephone lines.

An actuator stem connects to the valve disc and is responsive to a manually operable control rod projecting through the housing to engage the stem. Normal pneumatic pressure through the inlet permits air flow about the valve disc and through the outlet. If the pressure drop on the downstream side of the valve disc exceeds a predetermined limit, the valve disc is forced against the valve seat. This terminates air flow. Once the reason for the excessive air flow through the valve is corrected, the valve may be reset by actuating the manual rod against the stem. The biasing force on the valve disc is adjusted by means of a telescoping housing that cooperates with the valve body.

Automatic exchange systems. SIEMENS EDISON SWAN Ltd. Jan. 23, 1959 [April 25, 1958], No. 13230/58. Class 40 (4). [Also in Group XIX] In a system in which operations can fall into desirable and undesirable categories, the latter type are caused to charge a condenser and the former are caused to discharge the condenser, and arrangements are made for an indication to be given if the charge on the condenser exceeds a predetermined limit corresponding to an undesirably high proportion of undesirable operations. As described the invention is applied to a register-sender which receives digits in a twoout-of-five code, a signal containing other than two elements being undesirable and being either rejected with the reversion of a "" re-order signal "" or transmitted to a subsequent receiver which reverts a re-order signal to the registersender under consideration. In the diagram shown, these conditions cause the operation of one or other of the contacts br, bd (relay windings, not shown). Operation of the circuit is initiated by the throwing of key KR which discharges the condenser C whereupon the valve V 1 conducts to operate ER. When KR is released condenser C charges by grid current to a datum potential above which it cannot rise, but ER remains operated. When the register sender is seized, contact td is operated to bring up FT. When the register sender is released, contacts fn operate to bring up A for the duration of the release time of FT. Relay A connects up the charge/discharge circuit of condenser C. If either bd or br operate due to undesirable operation the condenser C charges negatively from potential derived over R 6 from the potentiometer R 1 , R 5 , R 2 . In a desirable operation, however, the condenser discharges via R 6 , R 7 . The discharge rate is arranged to be only a fraction of the charge rate. If the condenser C charges sufficiently, it cuts off V 1 to release ER and give an alarm over lead 1. The potentiometer R 5 may be adjusted so that, say, four initial undesirable actions are necessary to set the alarm off. For effecting the adjustment, plug PL is transferred from the busy jack TJB1 to TJB2 and key KT thrown to connect up lamp LP and to simulate the undesirable operation condition in the charge/discharge circuit. The potentiometer R 5 is then adjusted until the lamp is lit after the key KSR has been thrown four times, each throw of the latter key causing A to operate as though the register had been seized and released.",SIEMENS EDISON SWAN LTD,STALLWORTHY FRANK ALLEN;;DRAKE BERNARD;;CLARK JOHN BROWNLIE,,https://lens.org/011-740-960-752-780,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G07C3/14,G07C3/14,G1J J35           J35;;H4K KBQ           KBQ;;H4K K1A3          KBQ;;H4K K1L           KBQ,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Additionally, the clock recovery circuit uses differential logic, which decreases noise sensitivity and allows higher frequency operation.",APPLIED MICRO CIRCUITS CORP,BRYAN THOMAS CLARK;;MERRILL ALLEN CARL;;FU WEI,APPLIED MICRO CIRCUITS CORPORATION (1998-08-20);;MACOM CONNECTIVITY SOLUTIONS LLC (2017-01-26),https://lens.org/056-914-785-669-567,Granted Patent,yes,4,21,1,1,0,H04L7/033;;H04L7/033;;H03D13/003;;H03D13/003;;H03L7/089;;H03L7/089,H03D13/00;;H03L7/089;;H04L7/033,327/144;;327/155;;327/166,3,2,013-336-874-577-478;;069-827-813-710-35X,10.1109/jlt.1985.1074356;;10.1109/4.540046,"C.

    A gap setting apparatus incorporates an air gage to measure the pressure drop (and indirectly the flow rate) of air through a gap of a hydrodynamic bearing, while facing sections of the bearing are moved closer together. The measured pressure drop can be correlated to the actual bearing gap and monitored to determine when the proper gap has been achieved. More particularly, the inner and outer elements of the bearing are clamped in separate carriers and are held in place. The carriers are then moved toward one another so that the inner or shaft portion of the bearing slides into the outer or sleeve portion of the bearing. To accurately set the gap between the two, an air hose with an air gage attached to it is attached to one end of the bearing gap; air is pumped through the bearing gap, exiting through the opposite end of the gap, By testing a set of reference motor parts, a high end and a low end of an acceptable bearing gap range can be established, and the corresponding air gage readings obtained. Thus, once the air gage has been calibrated against a minimum and maximum gap, each motor can be assembled with the proper gap by simply adjusting the relative position of the parts until a target air gage reading or a reading between the high and low end of an acceptable range is obtained.

   An air bag sensor module fastening device for a vehicle is provided includes a vehicle mounting structure having an internally threaded member. A sensor is secured to a base for sensing vibrations caused by a crash of the vehicle. The base has an aperture extending therethrough that is aligned with the internally threaded member. The aperture includes a retaining portion. A fastener for securing the base to the vehicle mounting structure has a shaft with a head and a threaded portion opposite the head. The threaded portion is temporarily retained within the retaining portion in a shipping position. The threaded portion has a minor diameter and the shaft portion has a shaft diameter less than the minor diameter. As a result, the shaft will not be in an interference fit relationship with the retaining portion so that the compressive load of the fastener alone secures the base to the vehicle mounting structure. The threaded portion is disposed outside of the retaining portion in an installed position in which the threaded portion is received in the internally threaded member to secure the base to the vehicle mounting structure. In this manner, the threaded portion will engage only the internally threaded member so that the base is secured to the vehicle mounting structure by the compressive load of the fastener alone.

    An air bag sensor module fastening device for a vehicle is provided includes a vehicle mounting structure having an internally threaded member. A sensor is secured to a base for sensing vibrations caused by a crash of the vehicle. The base has an aperture extending therethrough that is aligned with the internally threaded member. The aperture includes a retaining portion. A fastener for securing the base to the vehicle mounting structure has a shaft with a head and a threaded portion opposite the head. The threaded portion is temporarily retained within the retaining portion in a shipping position. The threaded portion has a minor diameter and the shaft portion has a shaft diameter less than the minor diameter. As a result, the shaft will not be in an interference fit relationship with the retaining portion so that the compressive load of the fastener alone secures the base to the vehicle mounting structure. The threaded portion is disposed outside of the retaining portion in an installed position in which the threaded portion is received in the internally threaded member to secure the base to the vehicle mounting structure. In this manner, the threaded portion will engage only the internally threaded member so that the base is secured to the vehicle mounting structure by the compressive load of the fastener alone.

    A micromechanical, dithered device comprising a substrate, a movable mass connected to the substrate by a suspension, a position sensor, a dither signal generator, a dither force transducer connected between the substrate and the movable mass, the input of the dither force transducer being connected to the output of the dither signal generator and a calculator taking as inputs at least the position sensor output and the dither signal generator output. 

    In one embodiment of the invention, the dithered device includes an electrostatic force transducer for applying feedback. In this embodiment, dither force may be directly applied to the mechanical proof-mass utilizing electrostatic structures similar to electrostatic structures used for feedback. The electrostatic dithering structures provide good matching between the feedback and dither electrodes, enabling the use of simple logic for subtraction of the dither signal from the accelerometer output.

   A position-sense interface with improved transfer characteristics. Electrical position detection circuitry, which may be substantially time-multiplexed or frequency-multiplexed, comprises a differential charge integrator with input-sensed output-driven common mode feedback. By placing sense capacitors in the feedback loop of said differential charge integrator with input-sensed output-driven common mode feedback, improved position sensing linearity is attained. In some embodiments of the invention, a compensating charge is applied to the sense capacitors in a fashion that minimizes the output common mode shift of the opamp. The magnitude of the compensating charge may be preset at a substantially constant level, or derived by a feedback loop that measures the shift in output common mode voltage in response to an excitation signal and adjusts the magnitude of the compensating charge to drive said shift towards zero. 

   The invention has numerous advantages for acceleration measurement in both open-loop and force-balanced accelerometers, as well as rotation rate measurement in a vibratory rate gyroscope. Other applications in which the invention may prove advantageous include: motion detection for an oscillation-sustaining feedback loop; position detection of actuators, including micro-actuators used for effecting controlled motion of a disk-drive read/write head, or effecting controlled motion of an optically active device, such as a positionable mirror for use in fiber-optic data communications; and application of electrostatic forces for large motions.

Since a glass substrate sheet is brittle, cracking will then follow the perforated contour, allowing the glass substrate sheet to separate into any required shape defined by the perforations.",CORNING INC,WIELAND KRISTOPHER ALLEN;;PIECH GARRETT ANDREW;;KEECH JOHN TYLER;;CLARK JEFFREY MATHEW,CORNING INCORPORATED (2016-06-27),https://lens.org/136-463-699-191-843,Granted Patent,yes,566,3,12,12,0,C03B33/0222;;C03C15/00;;C03C17/06;;H01L23/15;;H01L23/49827;;H01L21/486;;B23K26/53;;Y02P40/57;;B23K26/0604;;B32B17/06;;B23K2103/54;;B23K26/382;;B23K26/389;;B23K26/53;;B23K26/55;;B32B17/06;;C03B33/0222;;C03C15/00;;C03C17/06;;Y02P40/57;;B23K2103/52;;B23K2103/54;;B32B17/06;;B32B3/266;;B32B2307/412;;B23K2103/54;;B23K26/53;;C03C15/00;;H01L23/49827;;H01L21/486;;H01L23/15;;C03B33/0222;;C03C17/06;;Y02P40/57;;B23K26/0604,B32B3/26;;B23K26/06;;B23K26/53;;B23K103/00;;B32B17/06;;C03B33/02;;C03C15/00;;C03C17/06;;H01L21/48;;H01L23/15;;H01L23/498,,108,73,131-148-364-661-32X;;003-857-163-655-741;;024-787-094-029-94X;;105-307-424-620-312;;077-598-233-122-678;;131-131-761-098-752;;120-200-430-811-119;;021-284-388-118-805;;065-987-072-043-963;;012-478-913-495-473;;017-961-740-347-14X;;003-338-603-887-112;;004-775-674-101-000;;074-337-724-088-318;;128-970-404-462-738;;177-442-673-406-329;;114-415-923-118-997;;111-248-736-431-30X;;035-844-571-474-470;;078-418-883-959-408;;022-237-297-981-958;;060-909-911-569-881;;026-967-704-433-095;;003-415-415-536-047;;114-784-673-404-651;;047-383-846-736-385;;015-020-110-645-495;;004-342-376-998-987;;048-258-198-738-887;;002-782-629-889-823;;032-893-435-917-435;;030-249-104-678-468;;094-655-931-124-800;;016-147-093-890-265;;045-215-059-090-321;;090-195-940-490-618;;041-183-785-736-87X;;022-583-266-845-71X;;039-562-658-951-751;;058-195-936-782-271;;043-980-432-228-110;;004-047-174-573-188;;006-302-617-732-079;;044-178-096-093-269;;064-437-456-423-559;;076-190-722-685-150;;097-250-867-600-086;;096-134-369-574-909;;101-702-599-925-796;;024-378-864-640-95X;;023-713-616-946-692;;024-397-098-734-503;;001-206-981-179-538;;135-780-355-556-91X;;136-816-663-230-661;;038-305-991-346-236;;062-488-065-965-809;;105-582-431-302-669;;048-258-198-738-887;;001-508-763-291-218;;036-007-799-678-881;;009-613-393-619-479;;038-591-557-351-606;;038-591-557-351-606;;062-803-239-326-183;;047-366-054-810-546;;015-621-722-028-168;;006-746-481-871-893;;198-930-550-224-538;;112-862-149-894-699;;117-164-488-448-785;;008-004-262-970-752;;150-402-196-931-203,10.1115/1.3250594;;10.1007/s00339-008-4672-2;;10.1007/s00340-007-2706-7;;10.1140/epjst/e2011-01506-0;;10.1063/1.4861899;;10.1117/12.854767;;10.1103/physrevlett.13.479;;10.1016/j.physrep.2006.12.005;;10.1007/s00339-012-7201-2;;10.1364/ol.34.003163;;19838260;;10.1016/j.optlastec.2006.07.012;;10.1002/lpor.201100031;;10.1364/josaa.4.000651;;19495387;;10.1364/opex.13.004708;;19516693;;10.1364/oe.14.005279;;10.1016/s0030-4018(98)00518-5;;10.1007/978-3-642-78759-1_13;;10.3788/cjl20093612.3313;;10.1007/s00339-008-4674-0;;16712248;;10.1103/physrevlett.96.166101;;20237630;;10.1364/ol.35.000880;;10.1109/3.631270;;10.1117/12.49219;;10.1088/0022-3727/30/15/001;;10.1080/0010751042000275259;;24473226;;10.1038/ncomms4166;;17621333;;10.1364/josaa.24.002296;;10.1007/s003390000546;;10.2961/jlmn.2008.03.0006;;10.1117/1.1617311;;10.1021/ie50355a027;;10.1364/oe.18.024688;;21164815;;10.1117/12.2039119;;10.1063/1.3670362;;pmc3365339;;22662087;;10.3788/cjl201340.0103005;;10.1007/s00170-014-6080-4;;23381235;;10.1364/ol.37.003294;;10.1016/j.phpro.2010.08.054;;20733892;;10.1364/ao.31.006653;;10.1063/1.3479419;;20173876;;10.1364/oe.18.000566;;18319972;;10.1364/ao.38.003670;;10.1364/ol.27.000243;;18007767;;10.1117/12.351825;;10.1063/1.119677;;10.1364/ol.31.001890;;16729105;;10.1117/12.351828;;10.1070/qe2005v035n11abeh013031;;10.1016/0169-4332(95)00446-7;;10.1016/s0169-4332(97)00763-0;;10.1007/s003390051552;;10.2172/6134;;10.1063/1.370197;;19158870;;10.1364/oe.17.000575;;10.1016/s0169-4332(01)00324-5;;12618781;;10.1038/nmat767;;10.1117/1.1668274;;10.1007/s003390050593;;10.2961/jlmn.2008.03.0006;;10.1117/1.2353119;;10.1088/1004-423x/5/5/005;;18545532;;10.1364/oe.16.008213;;10.1109/cleoe-eqec.2017.8087233;;10.1109/cleoe-eqec.2017.8087233;;10.1109/ecoc.2014.6964255;;10.1103/physreva.4.1195;;10.1364/josaa.24.002280;;17621332;;10.1103/physreve.73.056612;;16803062;;10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1140;;10.1109/tcpmt.2014.2303427;;10.1109/ectc.2010.5490913;;10.1117/1.oe.53.5.051503;;10.1109/ectc.2014.6897286,"ICNIRP, Infrared Radiation, https://www.icnirp.org/en/frequencies/infrared/index.html#:˜:text-Wavelength, accessed Apr. 7, 2021 (Year: 2014).;;U.S. Appl.

Electrical position detection circuitry, which may be substantially time-multiplexed or frequency-multiplexed, comprises a differential charge integrator with input-sensed output-driven common mode feedback. By placing sense capacitors in the feedback loop of said differential charge integrator with input-sensed output-driven common mode feedback, improved position sensing linearity is attained. In some embodiments of the invention, a compensating charge is applied to the sense capacitors in a fashion that minimizes the output common mode shift of the opamp. The magnitude of the compensating charge may be preset at a substantially constant level, or derived by a feedback loop that measures the shift in output common mode voltage in response to an excitation signal and adjusts the magnitude of the compensating charge to drive said shift towards zero. The invention has numerous advantages for acceleration measurement in both open-loop and force-balanced accelerometers, as well as rotation rate measurement in a vibratory rate gyroscope. Other applications in which the invention may prove advantageous include: motion detection for an oscillation-sustaining feedback loop; position detection of actuators, including micro-actuators used for effecting controlled motion of a disk-drive read/write head, or effecting controlled motion of an optically active device, such as a positionable mirror for use in fiber-optic data communications; and application of electrostatic forces for large motions.",ANALOG DEVICES IMI INC,LEMKIN MARK A;;JUNEAU THOR N;;CLARK WILLIAM A;;ROESSIG ALLEN W,ANALOG DEVICES INC (2001-01-17);;ANALOG DEVICES IMI INC (2001-03-26);;INTEGRATED MICRO INSTRUMENTS INC (2000-12-15),https://lens.org/131-426-298-628-27X,Granted Patent,yes,63,97,2,2,0,G01P15/125;;G01P2015/0814;;G01P15/125;;G01P2015/0814,G01P15/125,73/514.32,8,2,184-976-616-137-214;;048-201-797-510-596,10.1109/iedm.1992.307410;;10.1109/plans.1996.509052,"Henrion, W., et al., ""Wide Dynamic Range Direct Digital Accelerometer,"" IEEE Solid-State Sensor and Actuator Workshop, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, Jun. 1990, pp. 153-157.;;Sherman, S.J. et al., ""A Low Cost Monolithic Accelerometer; Product/Technology Update,"" International Electron Devices Meeting, San Francisco, California, Dec. 1992, pp. 501-504.;;Smith, T. et al., ""A 15b Electromechanical Sigma-Delta Converter for Acceleration Measurements,"" IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference, 1994, pp. 160-161.;;Warren, K., ""High Performance Silicon Accelerometers With Charge Controlled Rebalance Electronics,"" IEEE 1996 Position Location and Navigation Symposium, Atlanta, Georgia, Apr. 1996, pp. 27-30.;;Seeger, J.I. et al., ""Stabiization of Electrostatically Actuated Mechanical Devices,"" IEEE Transducers '97, Chicago, Illinois, Jun. 1997, pp. 1133-1136.;;Lemkin, M.A., Micro Accelerometer Design with Digital Feedback Control, Doctoral Thesis, U.C.

The driven oscillation combined with rotation of the substrate about an axis perpendicular to the substrate results in Coriolis acceleration along the other mode of compliance, the sense-mode. The sense-mode is designed to respond to Coriolis accelerationwhile suppressing the response to translational acceleration. This is accomplished using one or more rigid levers connecting the two proof-masses. The lever allows the proof-masses to move in opposite directions in response to Coriolis acceleration.

To improve the accuracy of the response of the centerline estimator, the threshold is increased or decreased based on the phase error at each read signal transition through the data-transition threshold. In addition, defects in the optical recording media are detected, and a defect present signal is used to inhibit the transition phase error input to the centerline estimator. This prevents the estimator from moving the threshold to an incorrect stable level. In addition, the defect present signal boosts the error feedback in the centerline estimator. The estimator then more quickly follows the read signal waveform. As a result, the estimator reacquires the centerline of the waveform after the read head moves past the defect without retriggering the defect detection circuit.",IBM,CLARK ALAN ROBERT;;HUTCHINS ROBERT ALLEN;;JAQUETTE GLEN ALAN;;PATAPOUTIAN ARA SARKIS;;SUTARDJA PANTAS,,https://lens.org/004-416-173-067-401,Granted Patent,yes,2,23,2,2,0,G11B20/10203;;G11B20/10203;;G11B7/00375;;G11B7/00375;;G11B20/10037;;G11B20/10037,G11B7/0037;;G11B20/10,369/59;;369/47;;369/124;;360/46,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A system may include one or more sensors configured to sense a signal indicative of muscle electrical or mechanical activity at a specific body location. The muscle electrical or mechanical activity signal may include an electromyography or a mechanical contraction signal. A pain analyzer circuit may extract from the sensed signal one or more signal metrics indicative of muscle tension, and generate a pain score using the signal metrics. The pain score may be output to a user or a process.

(GA) catalyzes the release of glucose from the non-reducing ends of starch and related oligosaccharides. GA is used in, and defines the rate limiting step of, the commercial production of high glucose syrups. GA is rapidly and irreversibly inactivated at temperatures above 65.degree.C. Based on the known GA structure and homology with other GA's, four proline substitution mutations were constructed and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These mutations were designed to increase GA thermal stability by decreasing conformational entropy of unfolding. None of the mutations decreased enzyme activity. Three of the mutations, Asp293-Pro, Asp345-Pro and Glu408-Pro, either decreased or did not significantly alter GA. However, one of the mutations, Ser30-Pro, significantly decreased the rate of irreversible thermal inactivation when analyzed between 65.degree. and 80.degree.C. At 70.degree.C a 1.9-fold decrease in thermal inactivation rate coefficients was seen and the activation energy for thermal inactivation (.DELTA..DELTA.G~) was increased by 2.2 kJ/mol. relative to wild-type GA. Additionally, when the Ser30-Pro mutation was combined with a previously characterized stabilizing mutation (Gly137-Ala, which increased the.DELTA..DELTA.G~ by 1.3 kJ/mol. at 70.degree.C) a 4.0 kJ/mol increase in .DELTA..DELTA.G~ relative to wild-type GA at 70.degree.C was seen without loss of enzyme activity.",UNIV IOWA STATE RES FOUND INC,FORD CLARK F;;COUTINHO PEDRO M;;LI YUXING;;ALLEN MARTIN J;;CHEN HSIU-MEI,,https://lens.org/150-941-405-492-431,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,7,0,,C12N9/34;;C12N15/56;;C12S3/12;;C13K1/06,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   Provided are a method, system, and program for establishing a point-in-time copy. A source relationship data structure and target relationship data structure are generated when establishing a point-in-time copy relationship between source and target storage areas, wherein the source and target relationship data structures each include an indicator for each source storage area and corresponding target storage area in the point-in-time copy relationship. The source and target relationship data structures are initialized to set the indicator for each source storage area and corresponding target storage area in the point-in-time copy relationship to a first value. A determination is made that data was written to one target storage area after establishing the point-in-time copy relationship.

An environment renderer creates a plurality of images, each corresponding to a viewing location and orientation, 'viewpoint'. A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) attached to a base unit by a tether cord or radio link navigates in the environment. The ROV has a spatial imaging device, such as a video camera, and actuators which propel it through the environment. Its position and orientation are determined by a position and attitude (P&A) sensing unit, and are passed to an ROV renderer which creates an image of a prestored model of the ROV having the same location and orientation as the ROV and viewed from a specified viewpoint. The viewpoints may be predetermined, provided to the system or may be interactively determined as an offset from the ROV position and orientation. Alternative embodiments include an image archive and comparison unit capable of storing images linked to information of the image acquisition, retrieving stored images with the image acquisition into and transforming one of the images to match the image acquisition information of the other image. Also, another embodiment employs an automated flight planner, which receives desired destinations from an operator, analyzes the environment and ROV models, and navigates the ROV through the desired trajectory without collision.",GEN ELECTRIC,CORBY NELSON RAYMOND JR;;SOLANAS CLAUDE HOMER;;MEENAN PETER MICHAEL;;VICKERMAN DAVID CLARK;;NAFIS CHRISTOPHER ALLEN,,https://lens.org/183-486-486-395-128,Patent Application,yes,2,4,4,4,0,G05B2219/32014;;G05D1/0044;;G05D1/0044;;G05B2219/32014,G01D21/00;;G05D1/00;;G05D1/02;;G06T1/00;;H04N7/18,,5,5,041-220-915-128-371;;031-284-030-189-61X;;013-070-620-075-376;;126-318-127-122-515;;052-693-657-140-616,10.1016/0921-8890(93)90007-y;;10.1109/icsmc.1989.71462;;10.1109/robot.1991.131806;;10.1109/iros.1993.583122;;10.1109/vrais.1993.380796,"HAYATI S.

A load/eject motor controls the rotation of the motor ring in response to the output signal from the position transducer.,IOMEGA CORP,NICKLOS CARL F;;JONES DAVID E;;RICH EDWARD L;;BRACKEN ALLEN T;;WOODS HAROLD;;BRUDERER CLARK,EMC CORPORATION (2010-02-11);;IOMEGA CORPORATION (1995-09-08),https://lens.org/175-371-206-640-038,Granted Patent,yes,17,24,6,6,0,G11B17/0288;;G11B19/00;;G11B23/0308;;G11B17/0288;;G11B19/00;;G11B23/0308,G11B17/028;;G11B17/035;;G01P5/16;;G11B19/00;;G11B23/03;;G11B25/04,360/71;;360/99.07,1,0,,,"Minico M 2000 RS Carbon Potentiometer Resistor Series Technical and Safety Data Sheets, W.

A system includes one or more physiological sensors configured to sense a physiological signal indicative of patient brain activity. The physiological signals may include an electroencephalography signal, a magnetoencephalography signal, or a brain-evoked potential. The system may extract from the brain activity signal one or more signal metrics indicative of strength or pattern of brain electromagnetic activity associated with pain, and generate a pain score using the one or more signal metrics. The pain score can be output to a patient or a process. The system may select an electrode configuration for pain-relief electrostimulation based on the pain score, and deliver a closed-loop pain therapy according to the selected electrode configuration.",BOSTON SCIENT NEUROMODULATION CORP,ANNONI ELIZABETH MARY;;GU JIANWEN;;ESTELLER ROSANA;;CLARK BRYAN ALLEN;;THAKUR PRAMODSINGH HIRASINGH;;SRIVASTAVA KYLE

This clean up occurs by solubilization of the non-polar material into the microemulsion when the treatment fluid contacts the non-polar material. An in situ microemulsion may be formed when one or more surfactant and a polar phase (e.g. water or brine), and eventually some small amount of organic phase, contacts the reservoir formation and solubilizes the non-polar material encountered in the porous media. The microemulsions are effective for removing the formation damage caused by non-polar materials which include, but are not necessarily limited to oil-based mud, synthetic-based mud, paraffins, asphaltenes, emulsions, slugs, and combinations thereof.",BAKER HUGHES INC,QUINTERO LIRIO;;JONES THOMAS A;;CLARK DAVID E;;GABRYSCH ALLEN D;;FORGIARINI ANA;;SALAGER JEAN-LOUIS,BAKER HUGHES HOLDINGS LLC (2008-06-26),https://lens.org/161-801-920-014-156,Patent Application,yes,19,47,13,49,0,C09K8/524;;C09K8/528;;C09K8/524;;C09K8/524;;C09K8/528;;C09K8/528;;E21B37/08,E21B43/22,166/270.1,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

An environment renderer creates a plurality of images, each corresponding to a viewing location and orientation, 'viewpoint'. A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) attached to a base unit by a tether cord or radio link navigates in the environment. The ROV has a spatial imaging device, such as a video camera, and actuators which propel it through the environment. Its position and orientation are determined by a position and attitude (P&A) sensing unit, and are passed to an ROV renderer which creates an image of a prestored model of the ROV having the same location and orientation as the ROV and viewed from a specified viewpoint. The viewpoints may be predetermined, provided to the system or may be interactively determined as an offset from the ROV position and orientation. Alternative embodiments include an image archive and comparison unit capable of storing images linked to information of the image acquisition, retrieving stored images with the image acquisition into and transforming one of the images to match the image acquisition information of the other image. Also, another embodiment employs an automated flight planner, which receives desired destinations from an operator, analyzes the environment and ROV models, and navigates the ROV through the desired trajectory without collision.",GEN ELECTRIC,CORBY NELSON RAYMOND JR;;VICKERMAN DAVID CLARK;;MEENAN PETER MICHAEL;;NAFIS CHRISTOPHER ALLEN;;SOLANAS CLAUDE HOMER,,https://lens.org/010-067-565-244-512,Patent Application,yes,2,10,3,3,0,B25J9/1689;;G05D1/0044,G01C21/00;;B25J9/16;;G01S15/89;;G05D1/00;;G06T1/00;;G21C17/003;;G21C17/08;;G21C19/02,,5,5,031-284-030-189-61X;;041-220-915-128-371;;013-070-620-075-376;;126-318-127-122-515;;052-693-657-140-616,10.1109/icsmc.1989.71462;;10.1016/0921-8890(93)90007-y;;10.1109/robot.1991.131806;;10.1109/iros.1993.583122;;10.1109/vrais.1993.380796,"DAS H.
