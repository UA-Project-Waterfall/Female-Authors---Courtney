   In one embodiment, the present invention provides a coated steel wire oven rack. The preferred coated steel wire oven rack includes a plurality of elongated steel wire members joined together to form an oven rack having an outer surface. The plurality of elongated steel wire members are made from a steel rod material containing from about 80 to about 99.9% by weight of iron, from about 0.001 to about 0.08% by weight of carbon and from about 0.001 to about 0.2% by weight of a carbon stabilizing transition metal, preferably selected from the group consisting of Vanadium, Tantalum, Titanium and Niobium. The plurality of elongated steel wire members are preferably made from the steel rod material by drawing the steel rod material to form steel wire; wherein the diameter of the cross-sectional area of the steel rod material is reduced by at least about 20% when the steel rod material is drawn to form the steel wire. The outer surface of the oven rack is coated by a glass material, preferably porcelain; wherein the amount of carbon in the steel rod material, the amount of carbon stabilizing transition metal in the steel rod material and the degree to which the diameter of the cross-sectional area of the steel rod material is reduced, when the steel wire is drawn from the steel rod material, is optimized so as to prevent chipping of the glass material from the outer surface due to the release of hydrogen gas from the steel wire members when the steel wire is either heated or cooled. In preferred embodiments, the glass material is coated onto the oven rack in two distinct coating steps. The present invention also includes a method of making a coated steel wire oven rack comprising the steps of providing steel rod material; drawing the steel rod material to form steel wire; forming a plurality of elongated steel wire members; joining the plurality of steel wire members to one another to form a steel wire oven rack; and coating the steel wire oven rack with a glass material, preferably porcelain.

The aggregate should be selected such that no more than about 5% by mass of the aggregate and preferably no more than about 3.5% by mass of the aggregate is able to pass through a 75 μm sieve.

The wedgelock also permits more precise and repeatable hole and other feature fabrication by more precisely locating an alignment fixture, such as a drill plate, relative to a structural assembly upon which fabrication operations are to be performed. The bushed spring loaded wedgelock (20) comprises a standard, commercially-available wedgelock modified by attaching a bushing (28) within which a spring loaded spacer (32) is telescopically mounted. Like a standard wedgelock, the bushed spring loaded wedgelock is inserted through collinear holes (16,17) in a drill plate or other alignment fixture and a structural assembly to clamp the assembly to the fixture. Even when used with a structural assembly with curved surfaces or thickness variations, the bushed spring loaded wedgelock (20) clamps structural members together by forcing a spring loaded spacer (32) against the front surface of the structural assembly while the shoulders (26) of the wedgelock arms (24) engage the rear surface of the structural assembly.

When the two-position valve assembly is in a first position is directs a fluid to a first side of the piston moving the piston to a first position. When the two-position valve assembly is in the second position it directs the pressurized fluid to a second side of the piston to move the piston to a second position. An arm is coupled to the piston. A control mechanism having a housing and a control rod, wherein the control rod is movable within the housing of the control mechanism between an extended position and a retracted position. The control mechanism has a biasing device for biasing the control rod toward the extended position, the control rod being configured to contact the arm to resist movement of the piston toward the second position to thereby control a rate by which the piston is advanced toward the second position. The assembly may also include a four-way two position air piloted valve to control the flow of a fluid to the arm.

    A power feed attachment that has a coupling structure to couple it to a hand held drill. A double-acting cylinder, which has a piston and a rod, and is fixedly coupled to the coupling structure. A two-position valve assembly is configured for directing a pressurized fluid to the double-acting cylinder. When the two-position valve assembly is in a first position is directs a fluid to a first side of the piston moving the piston to a first position. When the two-position valve assembly is in the second position it directs the pressurized fluid to a second side of the piston to move the piston to a second position. An arm is coupled to the piston. A control mechanism having a housing and a control rod, wherein the control rod is movable within the housing of the control mechanism between an extended position and a retracted position. The control mechanism has a biasing device for biasing the control rod toward the extended position, the control rod being configured to contact the arm to resist movement of the piston toward the second position to thereby control a rate by which the piston is advanced toward the second position. The assembly may also include a four-way two position air piloted valve to control the flow of a fluid to the arm.

A close fit between the shaft of the rotating drill/countersink bit and the inner surface of the sleeve prevents the bit from wandering upon repeated or heavy use. The drill/countersink nosepiece comprises a combination drill/countersink bit to be received by a drill motor chuck, a bushing to be received by a fixed housing portion of the drill motor, a sleeve telescopically mounted within the bushing, a spring within the bushing to bias the sleeve forward, and fingers or other features at the end of the sleeve for engaging an alignment slot in a drill plate. In operation, the nosepiece is attached to a power feed or hand-held drill motor and tooling slots or other features about the hole template in the drill plate are engaged by the sleeve fingers, which extend longitudinally from the retractable sleeve and lie within the infinite cylinder defined by the outer diameter of the sleeve.

    An axial feed apparatus having an adjustable feed stop is provided. The axial feed apparatus generally comprises a power feed module having an adjustable stop mechanism engaged therewith, wherein the adjustable stop mechanism may comprise a spindle threadedly engaging the power feed module. An adjustable depth-controlling device is further included intermediate the spindle and the power feed module, which uses a series of calibrated graduations in communication with the spindle such that a rotational change in the engagement of the graduations moves the spindle by a predetermined axial distance and thereby adjust the position of the feed stop for the power feed module. Such a power feed module may be combined with a drill motor to produce a device capable of drilling/countersinking holes in a workpiece. A drilling/countersinking device is thus facilitated that is capable of providing a readily adjustable feed stop for positively controlling the depth of the drilled/countersunk hole in a consistent, accurate, and repeatable manner. An associated method is also provided.
