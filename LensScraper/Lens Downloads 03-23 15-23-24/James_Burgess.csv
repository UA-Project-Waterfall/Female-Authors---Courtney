   A crop spraying apparatus includes a self-powered blower mounted on the rear rack of an ATV, with an air manifold extending behind the blower. Left and right spray nozzle assemblies are mounted on respective branches of the manifold, each actuatable either individually or together, so that the spray pattern may be directed to either side or both sides of the ATV. A tank is mounted on the front of the ATV, and a pump delivers pressurized liquid from the tank to a pair of isolation valves at the rear of the ATV. From the valves the solution is fed to injectors, each injector secured in one of the spray nozzles. The blast of air exiting each nozzle breaks up the injected solution into a fine mist that is carried by the air stream to the crops.

Filters with horizontal filtering partitions or layers; filtering-media; filters, cleansing.-Relates to highpressure filters in which the paper pulp or other filtering - medium is so arranged as to prevent undue packing and to facilitate the cleansing of the filter without removing the medium therefrom. The medium is placed in a number of sectional superimposed compartments having scouring-chambers 3, 4, 5, 6 arranged alternately with them. Each sectional compartment, of which three are shown in Fig. 2, is built up of strainer-plates at each end with intermediate perforated division plates separated by distancepieces consisting of a number of radial wings integral with a central boss 2<A>. In the lowest or first filtering-compartment, four division plates are employed, in the upper compartments there are only two division plates. The strainer and division plates are perforated with very fine holes or are covered with fabric to prevent the medium from passing through them. The strainer-plates are formed with projections 11, which bear against the adjacent plates to form the scouring-chambers 3, 4, 5, 6, each of which is provided with an inlet and an outlet pipe for the admission of steam or hot water and the discharge of the scouring-water. Each compartment is fitted with a pressure gauge. The liquid to be filtered enters by the pipe 21, and after passing upwards through the filter is discharged by the pipe 23. A modification is described suitable for filtering boiler feed-water containing oil; in this form the filtration takes place downwards through the filter, and means are provided for drawing off the oil which rises to the top of the filter. The filter is supported on pedestals, not shown in Fig. 2.",BURGESS JAMES;;MUIR JAMES FULTON,BURGESS JAMES;;MUIR JAMES FULTON,,https://lens.org/033-150-030-099-170,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,B01D24/165;;B01D24/004,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Catalyst is then added and mixed with the already formed mixture in the extruder screw. This mixture is extruded onto a conveyor and foamed on the conveyor. Finely divided carbon black, dispersing agent and/or surfactant may be mixed with polyol before introducing to the screw of the extruder or carbon black may be dispersed in polyol in the extruder and a polyol premix made before the remainder of the polyol is added. Foam cell size is decreased when extruder speed is increased. The foaming agent, which is preferably HCFC or water, may be mixed with one of the components, preferably the polyol, before introducing to the screw of the extruder. The mixture is cooled before extruding onto a conveyor to delay the foaming step until the mixture is outside the extruder. A carbon black dispersion may also be made, for future use.

Catalyst is then added and mixed with the already formed mixture in the extruder screw. This mixture is extruded onto a conveyor and foamed on the conveyor. Finely divided carbon black, dispersing agent and/or surfactant may be mixed with polyol before introducing to the screw of the extruder or carbon black may be dispersed in polyol in the extruder and a polyol premix made before the remainder of the polyol is added. Foam cell size is decreased when extruder speed is increased. The foaming agent, which is preferably HCFC or water, may be mixed with one of the components, preferably the polyol, before introducing to the screw of the extruder. The mixture is cooled before extruding onto a conveyor to delay the foaming step until the mixture is outside the extruder. A carbon black dispersion may also be made, for future use.

   A synthetic polymer foam is produced which incorporates fine particles of expandable graphite which surprisingly impart excellent fire resistant properties to the foam, particularly to foam made with a non-halogenated hydrocarbon as the primary blowing agent. For best results, the foam is produced through mixing the constituent materials, including the expandable graphite using a screw extruder. The foam can also be produced by creating a graphite/polyol or graphite/isocyanate dispersion in an extruder then mixing the remaining components in a conventional batch mixing or high pressure spraying process. Alternatively, conventional mixing can be used for the entire process, but use of a screw extruder in whole or in part is preferred.

Die Traversierungseffizienz solcher Hardware-Beschleuniger wird zum Beispiel dadurch verbessert, dass ein Strahl in Hardware aus dem Koordinatenraum des Strahls in zwei oder mehr Koordinatenräume an entsprechenden Punkten beim Traversieren der hierarchischen Beschleunigungsstruktur transformiert wird. In einem Beispiel ist der Hardware-Beschleuniger dazu konfiguriert, einen von einem Prozessor empfangenen Strahl aus dem Weltraum in mindestens einen alternativen Weltraum und dann in einen Objektraum in Hardware zu transformieren, bevor entsprechende Strahl-Primitiv-Schnittpunktergebnisse an den Prozessor zurückgegeben werden. Die hierin offenbarten Techniken erleichtern die Verwendung zusätzlicher Koordinatenräume, um Beschleunigungsstrukturen in einer Weise auszurichten, dass sie sich dem Raum, der von den zugrundeliegenden Primitiven eingenommen wird, die einer Strahlverfolgung unterzogen werden, effizienter annähern.",NVIDIA CORP,MUTHLER GREGORY;;BURGESS JOHN;;ROBINSON JAMES;;ANDERSON MAGNUS,,https://lens.org/198-383-710-992-06X,Patent Application,no,6,0,6,6,0,G06T15/06;;G06T1/20;;G06T1/60;;G06T2200/28;;G06T15/06;;G06T1/20;;G06T15/06;;G06T15/08;;G06T17/10;;G06T2210/12;;G06T1/20;;G06F9/5027;;G06T15/005,G06T15/06,,8,4,166-289-320-448-251;;069-375-135-590-648;;022-840-731-808-24X;;121-025-379-213-703,10.1145/1468075.1468082;;10.1145/358876.358882;;10.1145/15886.15902;;10.1145/1778765.1778803,"2.

Resilient couplings. ROLLSROYCE Ltd. Oct. 22, 1957 [Oct. 25, 1956], No. 32628/56. Class 80 (2). A resilient coupling transmitting torque to the supercharger of an internal combustion engine comprises driving and driven members interconnected by one or more torque transmitting elements offset from the axis of rotation of the driving and driven members and extending between them in a direction skewed to the axis of rotation to transmit axial and tangential loads, the torque transmitting element or elements permitting relative rotational movement of the driving and driven members on change of the torque transmitted by the coupling against the bias of resilient means resisting this relative rotational movement, a damping device reducing the relative rotational movement on occurrence of fluctuations of torque. In one form, a driving-plate 16, Fig. 1, is fast with a gear 10 and a shaft 12, and is formed with recesses in one face co-operating with similar recesses in the adjacent face of a gear 11 rotatably mounted upon the shaft 12. The recesses contain springs 24, Fig. 2, skewed with respect to the axis of the shaft 12. As shown, the ends of the recesses are of a hemi-spherical shape and receive similarly shaped nose members 25 at the ends of the springs 24. Alternatively, the springs 24 may engage directly, with the ends of the recesses. To obtain a compact arrangement, the springs 24 are also offset from the parallel to the axis of the shaft 12, as shown in Fig. 1. The springs 24 bias the gear 11 rightwards to engage a friction damping-plate 19 carried by a flange 18 fast upon the shaft 12. When fluctuations of torque occur, the gear 11 turns relatively to the driving plate 16, so that the springs 24 flex. Change of compression of the springs 24 changes the force with which the gear 11 is pushed against the frictional damping plate 19, so that the damping effect is correspondingly increased and decreased. The lost motion which can take place between the driving-plate 16 and the driven gear 11 is limited by axial projections 26 on the gear 11 engaging with play in circumferential slots 27 around the periphery of the driving- plate 16. Lubricant is supplied to the coupling through passages 31, 28 . . . 30. In another form, a driving-shaft 40, Figs. 4, 5, has axial splines 42 engaging with lost-motion internal grooves 46 in two torque-transmitting rings 43, 44 having external splines 48 engaging with lost motion internal grooves 49 within a driven gear 41. Springs 52, skewed relatively to the axis of rotation of the shaft 40, bias the driving rings 43, 44 to turn in opposite directions and take up the lost motion between the sets of splines and grooves 42, 46: 48, 49. Simultaneously, the axial component of the bias of the spring 52 tends to separate the two driving-rings 43, 44 and force them into engagement with flange rings 54 fast with the driven gear 41, to obtain friction damping. On relative rotation occurring between the driving-shaft 40 and the driven gear 41 with changes of torque, the springs 52 are compressed, the driving rings 43, 44 turn relatively to each other up to a limit determined by the lost motion in the spline and groove connections 42, 46; 48, 49, and relative rotation between the parts is damped by the driving-rings spring-biased to frictionally engage the flanged rings 54. In yet another form, a driving-shaft 60, Fig. 7, and a flange 60a carry rotatably a driven gear 61. A driving ring 65 has splines 66 engaging similar splines within the gear 61, and is in driving connection with the flange 60a by means of pivoted struts 68, skewed relatively to the axis of the shaft 60, engaging recesses in the flange 60a and the driving-ring. A spring 67 biases the driving- ring 65 rightwards, and simultaneously biases the driven gear 61 leftwards to engage frictionally with a ring 64 fast upon the shaft 60. When fluctuations of torque occur, the driven gear 61 turns relatively to the shaft 60, so that the skewed struts 68 pivot and move the driving- ring 65 leftwards, thus increasing the bias of the spring 67, and the driven gear 61 frictionally engaging the ring 64 dampens the relative rotation between the parts.",ROLLS ROYCE,CRUM JAMES CAMPBELL;;BURGESS SAMUEL;;WEBB SYDNEY ALFRED,,https://lens.org/120-775-070-925-055,Granted Patent,no,0,7,1,1,0,F16D3/66,F16D3/66,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A three dimensional textile joint reinforcement joins and reinforces a composite panel and a support structure. The composite panel includes lamina of textile fibers in the plane of the panel. The joint reinforcement is attached to the composite panel by staples. The support structure, which is typically perpendicular to the plane of the composite panel, is also attached to the joint reinforcement. Out of plane forces act upon the assembled structure and the joint reinforcement transfers out of plane loads between the support structure and the composite panel. The staples provide transfer of load to the plane of the textile fibers in the composite panel, where the composite panel is strongest.

    The present invention provides a method and apparatus for generating an animated character representation. This is achieved by using marked-up data including both content data and presentation data. The system then uses this information to generate phoneme and viseme data representing the speech to be presented by the character. By providing the presentation data this ensures that at least some variation in character appearance will automatically occur beyond that of the visemes required to make the character appear to speak. This contributes to the character having a far more lifelike appearance.

The axially-rotated valve typically may be designed to avoid flow separation and/or cavitation at full flow under a variety of conditions. Similarly, the valve is designed, in some embodiments, to produce streamlined flow within the valve. An axially aligned outlet may also increase the flow efficiency. A typical cross section of the eccentric split venturi may be non-axisymmetric such as a semicircular cross section which may assist in both throttling capabilities and in maximum flow capacity using the design of the present invention. Such a design can include applications for freeze resistant axially-rotated valves and may be fully-opened and fully-closed in one-half of a complete rotation. An internal wide radius elbow typically connected to a rotatable portion of the eccentric venturi may assist in directing flow with lower friction losses. A valve actuator may actuate in an axial manner yet be uniquely located outside of the axial flow path to further reduce friction losses. A seal may be used between the two portions that may include a peripheral and diametrical seal in the same plane.

   A three dimensional textile joint reinforcement joins and reinforces a composite panel and a support structure. The composite panel includes lamina of textile fibers in the plane of the panel. The joint reinforcement is attached to the composite panel by staples. The support structure, which is typically perpendicular to the plane of the composite panel, is also attached to the joint reinforcement. Out of plane forces act upon the assembled structure and the joint reinforcement transfers out of plane loads between the support structure and the composite panel. The staples provide transfer of load to the plane of the textile fibers in the composite panel, where the composite panel is strongest.

The body includes a loop structure having an inner surface, a reverse outer surface, a first side and a second side opposite to the first side. The inner surface defines an aperture and the reverse outer surface is configured for urging against a nasal passage wall of the nose. The body further includes an arm member having a first end coupled to the loop structure and a free end, the arm member extending outwardly from the loop structure and configured to extend along a nasal passage of the nasal cavity and engage with an internal surface of a nostril of the nose. In some embodiments, the nasal dilator comprises a valve mechanism that allows a user to intake or inhale through their nose while hindering a volume of air exhaled through their nose. The nasal dilator thereby makes use of the user’s own breathing to create positive nasal airway pressure to prevent or mitigate obstructed breathing by reducing a capacity of the user to exhale through their nose and thereby increasing pressure within the nasal passages. Increasing the pressure within the nasal passages reduces the likelihood of collapse of the nasal passage airway during sleep, which may result in fewer periods of airflow restriction and/or cessation, and may reduce snoring. The nasal dilator may be employed for treating snoring and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).",ASAP BREATHEASSIST PTY LTD,JOHNSON MICHAEL RALPH BURGESS;;HARTLEY TOBY JAMES;;TURNER ASHLEY MARK,,https://lens.org/141-651-003-777-416,Patent Application,no,0,0,21,21,0,A61F5/08;;A61F5/56;;A62B23/06;;A61F5/08;;A61F5/56;;A61F5/08;;A61F5/56;;A62B23/06;;A61F5/08;;A61F5/56;;A62B23/06,A61F5/08,,0,0,,,,PENDING

In many such cameras, the orientation of the lenses is selected to resemble to a regular prismatic solid (e.g., one lens oriented according to a face of a cube). However, such lens orientations may create gaps between images that result in blind spots, and/or varying degrees of coverage overlap. Presented herein are techniques for orienting the lenses in an asymmetric manner, comprising one forward lens and three backward lenses having a 120-degree rotational angle around a first (e.g., front-to-back) axis and a variable inclination angle perpendicular to the first axis. This lens orientation may be selected (e.g., by a computer) to achieve a desired degree of coverage overlap while significantly reducing gaps that create blind spots in the composite image.",MICROSOFT CORP,CORKERY JOE;;BURGESS JAMES;;HEBERT JOHN DANIELL;;VENABLE MORGAN;;PELLETIER BENJAMIN,,https://lens.org/023-433-469-020-913,Patent Application,no,5,2,4,4,0,G03B37/04;;H04N5/2624;;H04N23/698;;G02B13/06;;G03B5/00;;H04N9/646;;G03B37/04;;H04N5/2624;;H04N23/698,G03B37/04;;H04N5/232,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

In many such cameras, the orientation of the lenses is selected to resemble to a regular prismatic solid (e.g., one lens oriented according to a face of a cube). However, such lens orientations may create gaps between images that result in blind spots, and/or varying degrees of coverage overlap. Presented herein are techniques for orienting the lenses in an asymmetric manner, comprising one forward lens and three backward lenses having a 120-degree rotational angle around a first (e.g., front-to-back) axis and a variable inclination angle perpendicular to the first axis. This lens orientation may be selected (e.g., by a computer) to achieve a desired degree of coverage overlap while significantly reducing gaps that create blind spots in the composite image.",MICROSOFT CORP,CORKERY JOE;;BURGESS JAMES;;HEBERT JOHN DANIELL;;VENABLE MORGAN;;PELLETIER BENJAMIN,,https://lens.org/187-418-760-603-577,Patent Application,yes,3,0,4,4,0,G03B37/04;;H04N5/2624;;H04N23/698;;G02B13/06;;G03B5/00;;H04N9/646;;G03B37/04;;H04N5/2624;;H04N23/698,H04N5/232;;G03B37/04,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The axially-rotated valve typically may be designed to avoid flow separation and/or cavitation at full flow under a variety of conditions. Similarly, the valve is designed, in some embodiments, to produce streamlined flow within the valve. An axially aligned outlet may also increase the flow efficiency. A typical cross section of the eccentric split venturi may be non-axisymmetric such as a semicircular cross section which may assist in both throttling capabilities and in maximum flow capacity using the design of the present invention. Such a design can include applications for freeze resistant axially-rotated valves and may be fully-opened and fully-closed in one-half of a complete rotation. An internal wide radius elbow typically connected to a rotatable portion of the eccentric venturi may assist in directing flow with lower friction losses. A valve actuator may actuate in an axial manner yet be uniquely located outside of the axial flow path to further reduce friction losses. A seal may be used between the two portions that may include a peripheral and diametrical seal in the same plane. A seal separator may increase the useful life of the seal between the fixed and rotatable portions.",BIGHORN VALVE INC,WALRATH DAVID E;;LINDBERG WILLIAM R;;BURGESS ROBERT K;;LABELLE JAMES,UNIVERSITY OF WYOMING THE (1998-07-16);;BIG HORN VALVE INC (1998-07-08),https://lens.org/133-228-057-018-652,Granted Patent,yes,64,23,13,22,0,E03B9/02;;E03B9/025;;F16K1/22;;F16K3/085;;Y10T137/698;;Y10T137/698;;E03B9/02;;E03B9/025;;F16K1/22;;F16K3/085,E03B9/02;;F16K1/22;;F16K3/08,137/360;;251/124;;251/163;;251/304,11,0,,,"Febco Cross Connection Control Handbook, pp. 1 12 (undated).;;Febco Backflow Prevention Assemblies, Backflow Prevention Assemblies: Why They Are Needed (undated).;;Watts Regulator advertisement of TWS Hydrant (undated).;;Woodford Mfg.
