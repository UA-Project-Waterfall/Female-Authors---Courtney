   The present invention provides a human-computer interface. The interface includes provision of an application domain, for example corresponding to a three-dimensional application. The user is allowed to navigate and interact with the application domain. The interface also includes a personal domain, offering the user controls and interaction distinct from the application domain. The separation into two domains allows the most suitable interface methods in each: for example, three-dimensional navigation in the application domain, and two- or three-dimensional controls in the personal domain. Transitions between the application domain and the personal domain are under control of the user, and the transition method is substantially independent of the navigation in the application domain. For example, the user can fly through a three-dimensional application domain, and always move to the personal domain by moving a cursor near one extreme of the display.

A z dimension, approximately parallel to the direction of view, further characterizes the three-dimensional space. Objects in the space can be defined by x, y, and z coordinate sets. A control is provided having x and y coordinate sets as any other object. The z coordinate set of the control, however, spans a range of values, giving the control an increased depth. The control's range of z can be infinite, making the control accessible at all depths, or can be a finite range, making the control accessible only from that range of depths. Movement of a cursor into the region corresponding to the control initiates interaction with the user according to the control. The increased depth makes it easier for the user to access the control, since it reduces the precision of depth perception required to find the control. Once the user is in the region corresponding to the control, the effective depth for interaction can be relative to the depth when the user entered the control region, providing control interaction independent of entering depth.

    The present invention provides a human-computer interface. The interface includes provision of an application domain, for example corresponding to a three-dimensional application. The user is allowed to navigate and interact with the application domain. The interface also includes a personal domain, offering the user controls and interaction distinct from the application domain. The separation into two domains allows the most suitable interface methods in each: for example, three-dimensional navigation in the application domain, and two- or three-dimensional controls in the personal domain. Transitions between the application domain and the personal domain are under control of the user, and the transition method is substantially independent of the navigation in the application domain. For example, the user can fly through a three-dimensional application domain, and always move to the personal domain by moving a cursor near one extreme of the display.

The method comprises providing a three-dimensional space, characterized by x and y dimensions, together defining a plane approximately orthogonal to the user's direction of view into the space. A z dimension, approximately parallel to the direction of view, further characterizes the three-dimensional space. Objects in the space can be defined by x, y, and z coordinate sets. A control is provided having x and y coordinate sets as any other object. The z coordinate set of the control, however, spans a range of values, giving the control an increased depth. The control's range of z can be infinite, making the control accessible at all depths, or can be a finite range, making the control accessible only from that range of depths. Movement of a cursor into the region corresponding to the control initiates interaction with the user according to the control. The increased depth makes it easier for the user to access the control, since it reduces the precision of depth perception required to find the control. Once the user is in the region corresponding to the control, the effective depth for interaction can be relative to the depth when the user entered the control region, providing control interaction independent of entering depth.",NOVINT TECHNOLOGIES INC,ANDERSON THOMAS G,META PLATFORMS INC (2015-05-15);;NOVINT TECHNOLOGIES INC (2004-02-13),https://lens.org/047-723-199-307-223,Granted Patent,yes,7,6,4,4,0,G06F3/016;;G06F3/016;;G06F3/04815;;G06F3/04815;;G06F2203/014;;G06F2203/014,G09G5/08;;G06F3/00;;G06F3/01;;G06F3/033;;G06F3/048,345/157;;715/701;;715/702;;715/836;;715/850;;715/856,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Once the PDB transform has been applied to the audio signal, it is further processed by pick attack sag compressor (PAC) circuitry that applies positive sag control (PSC) and negative sag control (NSC) compression envelopes to the overall signal shape before presenting the resulting peak compressed signal through an audio volume control (AVC) and conventional solid-state semiconductor speaker power amplifier (SPA) for application to an audio speaker.",ANDERSON THOMAS CLAYTON,ANDERSON THOMAS CLAYTON,,https://lens.org/077-546-969-257-802,Granted Patent,yes,1,0,2,2,0,G10H1/12;;G10H3/187;;G10H2210/311;;G10K15/08;;H03F3/187;;H03G3/3005;;H03F3/187;;H03F3/213;;H03F3/213;;H03F3/45071;;H03F3/45475;;H03F2200/03;;H03F2200/03;;H03F2200/129;;H03F2200/549;;H03F2203/45116;;H03F2203/45512;;H03F2203/45528;;H03G3/02;;H03G3/3005;;H03G5/10;;H03G5/165;;H03G7/002;;H03G9/18;;H03G2201/103;;H04R3/00,H03G9/18;;G10K15/08;;H03F3/187;;H03F3/213;;H03F3/45;;H03G3/30;;H03G5/10;;H04R3/00,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Machine for making dollies on rolls from sheet rubber. DUNLOP RUBBER CO. Ltd. March 1, 1956 [April 16, 1955], No. 10996/55. Class 87(2). A machine for forming sheet rubber into rolls or dollies comprises a conveyer, means for shearing a length of rubber from a sheet carried by the conveyer, means for engaging the sheared edge, of the sheet and turning the leading portion of the sheet outwardly from the conveyer surface, and a member extending longitudinally over and spaced from the conveyer surface to frictionally contact the turned leading portion of the sheet, movement of the sheet causing the leading portion thereof to roll upon the member and form a dolly. Conveyer belts 1, supported on drums 2, are driven by chains 4 on sprockets 3 attached to the drums 2. Shearing members 6, 7, 8 with serrated trailing faces 12a, shearing edges 10 and skid bearing faces 11a, 11b are attached transversely to the conveyer belts 1. A pivoted shearing member 13 with a shearing edge 16 and skids 17, is attached to links 14 to a main frame 5 and is situated above the conveyer belts 1, so that the shearing edge 16 co-operates with the shearing edges 10 of the shearing members 6, 7, 8, the action of the skids 17 on the skid bearing surfaces lla, 11b ensuring that the cooperating shearing edges do not contact each other and jam. The shearing member 13 has a face 21 and an upper plate 22 with a face 23. After the shearing of the rubber sheet, these faces 21, 23 combine to turn outwards and roll upon itself the leading edge of the rubber sheet being conveyed on the conveyer belts 1. The rubber sheet then passes under the shearing member 13 and its rolled leading edge engages with a stationary rolling member 24. Further movement of the rubber sheet rolls the sheet against the underside of the rolling member 24 until a dolly is formed. The shearing edges 10, 16 again co-operate, shearing the trailing edge of the rubber sheet, the process then recommences and the rolled sheet drops off the conveyer end. The rolling member 24 is pivoted. at its forward end to the main frame 5, by links 25, and slides longitudinally at its rear end by rods 29 attached to it and acting on brackets 30 on the main frame 5. A modification is described in which the shearing member 13 is combined with the rolling member 24, the whole being spring mounted at its leading end.",DUNLOP RUBBER CO,LAMB THOMAS ANDERSON,,https://lens.org/134-717-065-178-73X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B26D3/003;;B26D7/32,B26D1/00;;B26D7/32,B5A AT21P         AT21P;;B5A A1R322        AT21P;;B5A A1R400        AT21P;;B5A A2B1          AT21P;;B5A A2B2          AT21P;;B5A A2D1X         AT21P;;B5A A2D2          AT21P;;B5A A2U22         AT21P;;B5A A2U23         AT21P;;B5A A2U7          AT21P,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Control of A.C. motors. GENERAL ELECTRIC CO. Ltd. Nov. 15, 1960 [Nov. 27, 1959], No. 40431/59. Class 38 (3). [Also in Group XXXVIII] A two-phase motor 19 with permanent magnet or D.C. supplied rotor 20, e.g. for operating control rods in a nuclear reactor, is caused to operate in synchronism with the rotor of an induction regulator 1, either rotating at slow speed or locked stationary. The induction regulator has a primary winding 4 supplied with A.C. and two split secondary windings 5, 6 and 7, 8. Each half winding is connected in series with one of four equal A.C. reference voltages from a transformer 9 ... 12 and a rectifier 21, 22, 23 or 24. The maximum output from each half winding 5 ... 8 is equal to the reference voltages, and at any instant the voltage in one half winding boosts its reference voltage while that in its neighbour bucks it. The output from each rectifier thus varies between zero and twice the reference voltage according to the position of the rotor of the induction regulator, and will be a maximum for one when its partner is at zero. The rectifiers are connected to motor windings 15 ... 18 which are arranged in pairs to provide two fields in quadrature. Hence, a resultant motor field is established, stationary when the induction regulator rotor is stationary, and rotating in synchronism when the rotor is moved, e.g. by a motor 2 through gear-box 3. In an alternative arrangement the junction of motor windings 15 and 16 is connected to that of 17 and 18 and corresponding interconnection is made between the rectifiers, the polarity of one pair being reversed.

This certain extent is such that when the stack is re-assembled without the thickness gauge, the plastically deformable member is now of a thickness to cause the spring to deform by an amount giving a desired compression force in the finished stack.

For example, the method allows a user to interact with a virtual craft, then push through the windshield of the craft to interact with the virtual world surrounding the craft. As another example, the method allows a user to feel transitions between different control domains of a computer representation of a space. The method can provide for force feedback that increases as a user's locus of interaction moves near a boundary, then perceptibly changes (e.g., abruptly drops or changes direction) when the boundary is traversed.

    A method of human-computer interfacing provides efficient intuitive controls in a three-dimensional space. The method provides a three-dimensional space, characterized by a z dimension approximately parallel to the user's direction of view, and x and y dimensions approximately orthogonal thereto. A control has x and y coordinate sets, and a z coordinate set that spans a range of values. The range can be infinite, making the control accessible at all depths, or can be a finite range, making the control accessible from that range of depths. Movement of a cursor into the control's region initiates user interaction according to the control. The control depth reduces the precision of depth perception required to find the control.

After ignition the source limits lamp current to provide a ballasting function.,GEN ELECTRIC,ANDERSON THOMAS E,,https://lens.org/030-615-143-197-138,Granted Patent,yes,10,102,13,13,0,H02M7/53846;;H02M7/53862;;H05B41/2885;;Y10S315/05;;Y10S315/02;;Y02B20/00;;Y02B70/10;;H02M7/53862;;H05B41/2885;;H02M7/53846;;Y10S315/05;;Y10S315/02;;Y02B20/00;;Y02B70/10,H05B41/24;;H02M7/5383;;H02M7/53846;;H02M7/53862;;H05B41/288,315209R,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   The present invention provides a method of allowing a user to efficiently direct the generation of frames in a computer animation. An object within a frame has an initial representation, e.g., position, orientation, scale, intensity, etc. A vector response characteristic can be associated with the object, where the vector response characteristic specifies how the representation of the object changes in response to applied vectors. For example, a ball might accelerate proportional to the directed magnitude of an applied vector, while a light source might change in intensity and color according to the direction and magnitude of an applied vector. Each object can have its own vector response characteristic, multiple vector response characteristics (e.g., applicable if different parts of the animation), and constraints on its vector response characteristics (e.g., must stay connected to another object). Objects can also generate their own vectors to apply to other objects (e.g., a wall can generate a vector to discourage objects from penetrating the wall).

   A method of providing an efficient interaction with a user of a human-computer interface. The method comprises establishing two paths: a device fundamental path and an object fundamental path. The two paths, which can comprise different geometric figures, are related by the interface in a defined correspondence. Motion by the user of an input device along the device fundamental path can be detected by the interface, and used to cause motion of an object in the computer application along the object fundamental path. The interface can also detect off-path motion of the input device. The interface, in some embodiments, can affect characteristics of the object or of other parts of the application responsive to such off-path motion. For example, the interface can change the angle or other property of an object responsive to off-path motion of the input device. The interface can also apply forces to an input device responsive to such off-path motion of the device. For example, the interface can apply force resisting off-path motion of the device, providing the user feedback. This feedback can guide the user to motion along the device fundamental path, and can allow the user to control an aspect (such as angle) of the application by control of the off-path force the user applies to the input device.

   The present invention is a system for controlling a pad conditioner in a CMP device. The system includes a roughness-sensing device mounted in proximity to a polishing pad. The roughness-sensing device generates an output responsive to a roughness of the polishing pad. A signal-processing unit then generates a roughness value of the polishing pad in response to the output from the roughness-sensing device, and generates a control signal in response to the generated roughness value. Finally, a control device controls motion of the pad conditioner in response to the control signal.

Potato planters. - The hopper T is provided with iron, wooden, or composition feed-rollers H, which may be covered with rubber, canvas, or other flexible material and filled with air, gas, springs, or packing, to feed the potatoes to a chamber B having an inclined bottom formed by a hinged platform C and provided with grooves E, Fig. 2, for the reception of endless chains E<1> carrying cups E<2>. Each cup E<2>, Fig. 3, is provided with a projection K which, just before the cup passes through an opening E<3> in the wall of the chamber B, enters an opening in the preceding cup and ejects surplus potatoes; these are returned to the chamber B by an elevator L over a platform C<2>. The chains E<1> are operated from the axle H<4> by spur-wheels G<1>, which may be put out of gear by a clutch J operated by a lever J<1> and a hand-lever J<2>. The chains E<1> .are kept in position in the grooves E by side guards or rollers at each end, and are tensioned by spring plates N. The platform C is hinged at C<1> and is kept normally raised by a cord F<2> connected to a shutter W controlled by a spring W<1>. When the feed becomes excessive and the platform C is depressed, the shutter W is moved to regulate or cut off the supply from the hopper T. An endless band A operated by one roller H may be provided to help the feed, which is also assisted by an horizontally-reciprocating slide S provided with spars S<1> which coact with grooves on cams S<2> on the shaft S<3> carrying the other roller H. Pivoted spars F, vibrated by a lever I<1> actuated by projections I<2> on the roller H, prevent clogging in the chamber B. Spring-controlled hinged wings I, Fig. 2, prevent potatoes from being deposited in the recesses Z in the grooves E. The potatoes from the cups E<2> pass down the tube D into a furrow formed by a disk roller V. The rollers H may have plain or fluted surfaces and one of them may be of worm shape. The hopper T may be pivoted at one side and may have a riddle in it. According to the Provisional Specification, the grooves E are adjustable in width, and a groove running in the contrary direction to the grooves E may be provided.",ANDERSON THOMAS BELL,ANDERSON THOMAS BELL,,https://lens.org/013-947-952-529-387,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,A01C9/02,A01C9/02,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Commutation of the ac source voltage is initiated as the instantaneous current drawn from the source equals a predetermined reference current level. Prior to lamp ignition the ac source drives the L-C circuit at resonance causing a voltage buildup which initiates an ignition. After ignition the source limits lamp current to provide a ballasting function.,GEN ELECTRIC,ANDERSON THOMAS E,,https://lens.org/060-719-252-360-306,Granted Patent,no,0,0,13,13,0,H02M7/53846;;H02M7/53862;;H05B41/2885;;Y10S315/05;;Y10S315/02;;Y02B20/00;;Y02B70/10;;H02M7/53862;;H05B41/2885;;H02M7/53846;;Y10S315/05;;Y10S315/02;;Y02B20/00;;Y02B70/10,H05B41/24;;H02M7/5383;;H02M7/53846;;H02M7/53862;;H05B41/288,315-54,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A resilient, shock absorption assembly that mounts between available sail rigging lines and a boat hull. In one assembly, a piston is resiliently biased relative to a housing and contained spring to permit reciprocating movement. Couplers at distal ends of the piston and housing attach to suitable rigging lines and/or the boat. In other assemblies, resilient elastomer cores bias movement of a piston or cable. In another assembly fitted within a main sail boom, a cable biases the boom rigging lines. In still another construction, an A-shape, mast replacement framework is secured to pivot from a boat's deck. Resiliently biased cables act as a mast and support a sail boom. One or more separate resilient assemblies can be coupled to the sail. The cable mast and rigging lines are thus made resilient to counterbalance the boat against heeling with the presence of rough water and gusty winds.

The container and closure include mechanisms for engaging each other when the closure system adopts a closed configuration. In the closed configuration, the liner adopts a moderately non-flat profile and covers a mouth of the container. The closure can include a deflection rib and a highly curved top panel; when a pushing movement of sufficient force is applied to the closure, the closure system transitions from the locked configuration to an unlocked configuration. At this time, the deflection rib deforms a central portion of the liner, and the highly curved portion of the top panel engages the mouth of the container; this action can cause an outer portion of the liner to contact the highly curved portion and transition to a highly curved profile mimicking the profile of the top panel.",PHOENIX CLOSURES INC,STONEBERG THOMAS;;ANDERSON DAVID,PHOENIX CLOSURES INC (2018-02-05),https://lens.org/095-586-524-688-860,Patent Application,yes,11,10,2,2,0,B65D50/043;;B65D50/043;;B65D41/06;;B65D41/06;;B65D53/04;;B65D53/04,B65D50/04;;B65D53/04,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

UNITED KING- DOM ATOMIC ENERGY AUTHORITY. Oct. 19, 1961 [Jan. 23, 1961], No. 2684/61. Class 39 (4). Temperature measurement means for a fuel element channel of a nuclear reactor comprises a thermocouple stem adapted to be disposed within the channel, to extend outwardly from the fuel element intended to be nearest the reactor charge face when the fuel elements are in operative position within the channel, and to support a thermocouple hot junction for exposure to coolant in the channel. In Fig. 1 the thermocouple stem comprises an outer tubular member 3 and a telescoping inner tubular member 4, the outer member being supported by radial lugs 6 from a lip 5 in the fuel channel and the inner member terminating in a cone adapted for stacking arrangement with a cup at the upper end of the uppermost fuel element (not shown). The hot junction 7 of a thermocouple is clipped to the exterior surface of the wall of member 3 and is connected by a lead 8 to a remote indicator instrument outside the reactor core. In an alternative, Fig. 2 (not shown), the junction 7 projects radially outward from the wall of member 3 to make direct contact with the coolant gas. In a modification, Fig. 3 (not shown), the junction 7 is surrounded by an open-ended shield which screens it against heat radiated from the channel wall and provides some protection against damage during charging operations. In a further arrangement, Fig. 4 (not shown), apertures are provided in members 3 and 4 to allow coolant to flow inside the thermocouple stem, and the hot junction 7 is located inside the stem.

   The invention relates to IgE antagonists, including monoclonal antibodies, and their use in ameliorating asthma and allergic diseases in offspring of mothers treated during pregnancy with such antagonists. The preferred IgE antagonists do not induce release of the mediators of allergy. One example of such IgE antagonists are anti-IgE antibodies which bind to secreted IgE, to membrane IgE on the surface of IgE-producing B cells, but not to IgE bound to the FcRI on the surface of basophils or mast cells. Preferably, these antibodies also do not bind to IgE bound to FcRII receptors. It is also preferable if these antibodies have human IgG1 or IgG3 constant regions, as well as further human portions, if desired.

I., Birkin, T. S., and Anderson, T. Oct. 18. Lace - making. - Relates to the production of any-motion cross-net, combination work, clothing, muslin, and Madras effects with right or left hand loops, and open-work and Swiss effects, on curtain lace machines in which the three or four guide-bars employed have, generally, three movements, and the jacks or pickers two movements, at each half-motion of the machine. Fig. 1 shows a machine with three full-threaded bars r, s, t, the back bar r carrying clothing threads u, the bar s spool threads v, and the front bar t warp threads x. A trick bar h rises one gait on the front halfmotion, or ""motion,"" and falls one gait on the back motion. The pickers k are each connected by strings n, o to two double-action jacquards, which rise together but fall at different times. They can be held by the jacquard strings in the full-line position 3 clear of all the threads, or in the dottedline position 2 engaging the threads u, v ; or they may be left unselected when they engage all the threads. According to one method, the bars r, t are caused to rise two gaits before the pickers enter, and then to fall one gait, while the bar s rises one gait before the pickers enter a second time ; the bar r finally rises three gaits, after which the carriages pass to the back. On the back motion, the bar r falls three gaits, while the bars s, t, fall two gaits before the pickers enter, then falls one gait more while the bars s, t rise one gait, after which the carriages pass to the front. In a second method, the bars r, s rise three gaits before the carriages pass to the front, while on the back motion the pickers enter a second time, after which the bar s falls three gaits. In a third method, a thin spool thread bar y is placed between the thickspool thread-bar s and the bar t. On the front motion, the bars r, y rise two gaits, while the bar t rises one gait before the pickers enter, then fall one gait while the bar s rises one gait before the pickers enter a second time, the bar r finally rising three gaits, after which the carriages pass. The bars s, t then fall two gaits, while the bar r falls three gaits and the bar y one gait before the pickers enter, then rising one gait while the bar r falls a further gait, before the carriages re-pass to the back. Any-motion cross-net, embossed clothing, open-work and two gait muslin, or Madras effects with loops to the right or left, can be made by all three methods. Single and double nip combination effects can also be produced by methods (1) and (2) and single - nip combination and Swiss effects by method (3). By interchanging the bars r, s, clothing with the threads bound in on both sides is obtained by methods (1) and (3) in place of embossed clothing. Cross-net A, Fig. 3, is made from the threads u, v. Selected pickers k are moved to the positions 2 and 3 on alternate front or back motions. Embossed clothing B is also made from threads u, v, the pickers being held clear of the threads on both motions. Open-work C is made from all the threads. On the front motion, the pickers on the second entry are moved to positions 2 or 1. On the back motion, when working the guide-bars according to method (1), the pickers are moved in a similar manner, or to position 2 at the first entry, when working accordmg to methods (1) and (3). Two - gait muslin effects D with loops towards the left band are made from threads u by holding the pickers clear of the thread on the front motion, and moving them to engage the threads u, v on the back motion. Muslin effects E, having the loops towards the right hand, are obtained by reversing these movements. Madras effects F, with loops towards the left hand, are made from the threads u by moving the pickers to engage the threads u, v for three motions, commencing on a front motion, and then clear of the threads on the fourth motion. Madras effects G having the loops towards the right hand are obtained by moving the pickers to the position 2 for a front and back motion, and then to the positions 3 and 2 for the succeeding front and back motions. Single-nip combination work H is made by moving the pickers to the positions 2 and 1, respectively, on consecutive front and back motions. To obtain double-nip combination work by methods (1) and (2), the pickers are moved to positions 1 on both motions. Swiss effects K are made from the fine spool threads by method (3) only by moving the pickers to the positions 1 and 2, respectively, on the front and back motions. Bound-in clothing L is made according to methods (1) and (3) by interchanging the bars r, s, the pickers being held in position 3 on both motions.",BIRKIN THOMAS ISAAC;;BIRKIN THOMAS STANLEY;;ANDERSON THOMAS,BIRKIN THOMAS ISAAC;;BIRKIN THOMAS STANLEY;;ANDERSON THOMAS,,https://lens.org/046-156-542-312-763,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

I., Birkin, T. S., and Anderson, T. Nov. 3. Lace and lacemaking. - Crossnet fabric, with or without Swiss, combination, or openwork effects, and clothing, muslin, or Madras effects, can be made in a curtain machine from spool, fine spool, warp, and bobbin threads by moving the jacks by means of a tricked bar after they have entered the threads. Three guide-bars a, b, c are used to carry the spool threads d, fine spool threads e, and warp threads f respectively. Below the comb bars are jacks or pickers l oscillated at each half-motion by a cam n. A tricked bar for guiding the upper ends of the jacks rises and falls one gait on the back and front motion respectively after the jacks have entered the threads. Each jack can be held back by jacquard strings l<1>. The crossings p, q of the cross-net are produced by combining the warp thread f of one pillar r with the threads of an adjacent pillar and combining the spool thread e of the adjacent pillar with the threads of the former pillar. For this purpose, the jacks l are moved to the extreme position s through all the threads or to the position t through the spool threads only. To produce the combination work u, the jacks are passed through the spool and finespool threads to the position u on the front halfmotion, and take up the position s for the back half-motion. This enables the bobbin thread of one pillar to be laid round its own pillar and the warp thread of an adjacent pillar, while the bobbin thread of the latter is laid round its own pillar only. To produce the clothing or four-gait work w, the jacks stand clear of the threads in the position x during both half-motions. The muslin or two-gait work y is produced by passing the jacks through the spool threads d to the position t on the front half-motion and holding them in the position x on the back half-motion. The Swiss effect z is produced similarly from the thin spool threads e The jacks enter to the position u on the front half-motion and to the position t on the back half-motion. To produce the single-motion Madras effect e', the jacks enter to the position u during a first two front and back half-motions and then retire to the position t for the next two front and back half-motions. Where no effect is required, the bobbin thread pillars as at r with its own warps and spool threads. Openwork b<1>, b<2> can be produced between any two other effects by leaving the jacks at the position t for both half-motions of the machine.",BIRKIN THOMAS ISAAC;;BIRKIN THOMAS STANLEY;;ANDERSON THOMAS,BIRKIN THOMAS ISAAC;;BIRKIN THOMAS STANLEY;;ANDERSON THOMAS,,https://lens.org/105-951-343-343-146,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   A pump having both a short stroke pumping mode and a long stroke pumping mode. The pump has two material cylinders, each with an attached hydraulic cylinder for operating a piston rod extending through both the material and hydraulic cylinders. The piston rods are driven by hydraulic fluid supplied to the hydraulic cylinders and are synchronized so that as one piston rod extends, the other piston rod retracts. The piston rods draw material into the material cylinders when retracting, and pump material out of the material cylinders when extending. To pump in a short stroke mode, a diverter valve is placed between the hydraulic pump and the hydraulic cylinders which diverts an amount of hydraulic fluid to the cylinders, causing the hydraulic pistons to only be extended about half the length of the hydraulic cylinder.

    A pump having both a short stroke pumping mode and a long stroke pumping mode. The pump has two material cylinders, each with an attached hydraulic cylinder for operating a piston rod extending through both the material and hydraulic cylinders. The piston rods are driven by hydraulic fluid supplied to the hydraulic cylinders and are synchronized so that as one piston rod extends, the other piston rod retracts. The piston rods draw material into the material cylinders when retracting, and pump material out of the material cylinders when extending. To pump in a short stroke mode, a diverter valve is placed between the hydraulic pump and the hydraulic cylinders which diverts an amount of hydraulic fluid to the cylinders, causing the hydraulic pistons to only be extended about half the length of the hydraulic cylinder.

Le plasma est généré en introduisant de la matière dangereuse vaporisée et un gaz d'alimentation dans une chambre à vide. La chambre possède une source de champ magnétique et une source de rayonnement électromagnétique. Le plasma de résonance cyclotronique est produit par la résonance qui a lieu lorsque la fréquence du rayonnement électromagnétique est égale à celle de la gyration des électrons ou autres particules chargées dans le champ magnétique selon la formule : Fres = (1/2)(qB/m) hertz. Lorsque q représente la charge de l'électron ou de l'ion, B représente la force du champ magnétique et m est la masse de l'électron ou de l'ion. La force du rayonnement électromagnétique est réglée de sorte que les gaz d'écoulement sont ionisés pour former un plasma. Pendant la réaction, les particules chargées entrent en collision avec des particules neutres pour effectuer à la fois une ionisation et une fragmentation (la décomposition des molécules de masse élevée en fragments de masse plus faible). Lorsque le rayonnement électromagnétique est appliqué à la fréquence de résonance cyclotronique des ions pour un rapport particulier charge/masse, les ions de ce rapport sont accélérés vers l'extérieur et entrent en collision avec d'autres particules dans le plasma. Ceci peut se traduire par une fragmentation supplémentaire de ces ions ou d'autres particules, ou alors les ions sont expulsés ou récupérés sélectivement aux limites extérieures du réacteur.",JAPAN DEV & CONSTRUCTION,SHOHET JUDA LEON;;ANDERSON DAVID THOMAS,,https://lens.org/088-588-530-636-720,Patent Application,yes,0,0,5,9,0,A62D3/17;;A62D3/19;;A62D2101/20;;A62D2101/22;;A62D2101/40;;A62D2203/10;;B01J12/002;;B01J19/088;;B01J2219/0894;;A62D3/19;;A62D2101/20;;A62D3/17;;A62D2203/10;;B01J12/002;;A62D2101/40;;B01J19/088;;A62D2101/22;;B01J2219/0894,A62D3/00;;A62D3/17;;A62D3/19;;A62D101/20;;A62D101/22;;A62D101/40;;B01J12/00;;B01J19/08;;F23G7/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    An apparatus and a method for lifting a wafer off of an electrostatic chuck after wafer processing operations are provided. In a specific example, a wafer lifting mechanism for controlling the lifting of the wafer off of an electrostatic chuck at a completion of processing is defined. The wafer lifting mechanism includes a pin lifter yoke that is oriented below an electrostatic chuck. The pin lifter yoke has a set of pins connected thereto, and the set of pins are configured to traverse through the electrostatic chuck and contact a bottom surface of the wafer. A link is also provided and connected to the pin lifter yoke. The link is moveable so as to cause the pin lifter yoke and the set of pins to move within the electrostatic chuck and contact the bottom surface of the wafer, and once in contact with the bottom surface of the wafer, the set of pins are capable of lifting the wafer off of the electrostatic chuck. Further included is a motor for moving the link and a force feedback system for limiting an application of force by the set of pins to the bottom surface of the wafer during the lifting. The application of force, in one example, is discontinued when a strain level grows to a level that can potentially cause damage to the wafer, such as in those cases where the wafer is still strongly adhered to the chuck with electrostatic forces.

    An emergency response system wristwatch having upper and lower case sections connected by a hinge is combined with a removable interference bracket disposed between the two case sections. The upper case section has opposing rear and front surfaces, where the front surface includes a dial face. The upper case section is operable to pivot on the hinge between open and closed positions. The lower case section has an activation button that is exposed when the upper case section is in the open position. When the upper case section is in the closed position, the rear surface of the upper case section is disposed adjacent the activation button. Without the removable interference bracket between the upper and lower case sections, the rear surface of the upper case section is operable to move toward the lower case section and press upon the activation button if pressure is applied to the dial face. Housed within the lower case section is a wireless transmitter that is activated when the rear surface of the upper case section presses the activation button. When activated, the wireless transmitter transmits a wireless emergency signal. When the removable interference bracket is installed between the upper and lower case sections, the bracket prevents the rear surface of the upper case section from pressing the activation button if pressure is applied to the dial face. Thus, the interference bracket prevents accidental activation of the wireless transmitter due to inadvertent pressure upon the dial face.

   An apparatus and a method for lifting a wafer off of an electrostatic chuck after wafer processing operations are provided. In a specific example, a wafer lifting mechanism for controlling the lifting of the wafer off of an electrostatic chuck at a completion of processing is defined. The wafer lifting mechanism includes a pin lifter yoke that is oriented below an electrostatic chuck. The pin lifter yoke has a set of pins connected thereto, and the set of pins are configured to traverse through the electrostatic chuck and contact a bottom surface of the wafer. A link is also provided and connected to the pin lifter yoke. The link is moveable so as to cause the pin lifter yoke and the set of pins to move within the electrostatic chuck and contact the bottom surface of the wafer, and once in contact with the bottom surface of the wafer, the set of pins are capable of lifting the wafer off of the electrostatic chuck. Further included is a motor for moving the link and a force feedback system for limiting an application of force by the set of pins to the bottom surface of the wafer during the lifting.
