A D.C. chopper circuit utilizing resonance commutation comprises a silicon-controlled rectifier SCR-1 arranged to supply pulsed D.C. to a load 12, e.g. a shift register. In operation, a positive pulse to SCR-1 when push switch 14 is closed, fires it and it remains ON until commutated off, to supply load 12. An external signal to shift is applied to transformer T-1 which triggers SCR-2. SCR-2 fires and short circuits a series resonance circuit L-1 C-1, and current from a capacitor C-1 flows to and fro in the loop, capacitor C-1 being initially charged via R-6. During the second half cycle of oscillation in the loop current cannot flow through SCR-2 and goes instead from L1, via diodes Dl, D2 to C1. The voltage drop across D2 reverse biases SCR-1 and shuts it off, interrupting the current to the load. In addition the voltage on bus 15 exceeds that in bus 10 and SCR-2 cuts off. A trigger pulse is then applied to a transformer T-2 to gate SCR-1 and turn it ON again to supply the load. To recharge C-1 at the end of the cycle a circuit C2, R5, L17 of transformer T-3 is placed across SCR-1. When SCR-1 fires at conclusion of cycle its voltage drop goes to near zero and this change in voltage causes T-3 to gate SCR-3, via a diode D-3, thus firing it which recharges C1. Thus when SCR-1 fires SCR-3 also fires. When SCR-2 is then fired and the resonant circuit L-1, C-1 later turns off SCR-2, no current can pass to SCR-3 which shuts off.",BROOKS WILLIAM,BROOKS WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/032-621-336-221-994,Granted Patent,no,0,0,4,4,0,H02M3/135;;H02M3/135;;H03K3/352;;H03K3/352,H02M3/135;;H03K3/352,H3P PPXX          PPXX;;H3T TCX           TCX;;H3T T1CX          -;;H3T T2A1N         -;;H3T T2A1S         -;;H3T T2A2          -;;H3T T2B5          -;;H3T T2B9          TCX;;H3T T2E           -;;H3T T2F5          -;;H3T T2S           -;;H3T T2T3TX        -;;H3T T2W2          -;;H3T T3F1          -;;H3T T5E           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

BROOKS. 9 June, 1967 [13 June, 1966], No. 26772/67. Heading G4H, G4C. The stages of an electronic shift register control respective display elements by means of silicon-controlled-rectifiers. In the shift register of Fig. 7, having data input at 86, shift pulses at 90 reset transfluxors 71-77 to ""zero"". Those not already at ""zero"" charge following capacitors 94 to set the respective next transfluxors to ""one"". Each cycle of an oscillator 70 non-destructively reads out the transfluxor state via silicon-controlledrectifiers 61-67 to lamps 11-17. In the shift register of Fig. 8, an input of ""one"" at 104 causes silicon-controlled rectifier 131 to fire, lighting lamp 111, discharging capacitor 161 and charging capacitor 141. A shift pulse opening switch 103 cuts off S.C.R. 131 so that capacitor 141 starts to discharge via lamp 111. The shift pulse ends before this discharge has proceeded far whereupon capacitor 141 charges capacitor 161 causing siliconcontrolled-rectifier 132 of the second stage of the register to fire. The next shift pulse cuts off both S.C.R's 131, 132 and so on. Had the input at 104 been ""zero"", S.C.R. 131 would not have fired, capacitor 141 would not have charged so it could not subsequently discharge to fire S.C.R. 132 via capacitor 161. The ""lamps"" above may each be a bar consisting of several neon tubes or a single fluorescent lamp, the bars being arranged in a figuregram or &c. to permit a selected numeral or letter or &c. to be built up by energizing selected bars. Alter natively, the lamps may illuminate respective masks for optical projection on to a screen. A row of figuregrams may be controlled ,by respective shift registers connected in series. Alternatively, each row of an elongated matrix of individual lamps may be controlled by a respective shift register to allow a message to be displayed and moved along. The data and shift input switches 86, 90, 104, 103 may be controlled by stepping switches or other shift registers. Input may be manual or on punched tape or cards.

WESTING- HOUSE BRAKE & SIGNAL CO. Ltd. May 6, 1963 [May 11, 1962], No. 18161/62. Heading F2F. [Also in Divisions B7, G1 and H3] Apparatus for preventing excessive slipping between one or more members of a first body engaging a second body on a surface on which forces are exerted via the members to tend to produce a change of speed of the first body comprises means for deriving respective signals representative of the peripheral velocities of the members, selective means for selecting in accordance with the relative magnitudes thereof that one of the signals which corresponds to the member which slips least and respective comparison means for comparing each signal with the signal thus selected to give indication of slip between a member or members and the surface being excessive with means responsive to such indication for adjusting the force applied via the member or members in such a sense as to tend to reduce the slip. As shown compressed air from a compressor is applied to a storage reservoir 2 the output pipe 3 of which is connected through a driver's valve 5 and pipes 6, 7 to electro pneumatic valves 17, 18. The latter are connected respectively to the front and rear brake cylinders 8, 10 and 9, 11. Associated with each wheel is a generator 12, 13, 14, 15, e.g. a variable reluctance toothed wheel generator which induces a voltage in a coil of a permanent magnet the frequency of which is proportional to the angular velocity of the wheel. A diode pump circuit, Fig. 3, produces at the point A a voltage proportional to the angular velocity of the wheel. The respective voltages produced by the generators 14, 15 are then compared by a comparison amplifier circuit comprising transistors T2, T3 and diode D3 which along with the corresponding transistors and diode in the other half of the circuit makes available at the point B whichever of the signals derived from the two diode pumps is the greater. The signal at B is fed to the transistor T2 and also to the corresponding transistor to produce at C a signal which represents any difference that exists between the angular velocity of the wheel associated with that circuit and the greater value of angular velocity represented by the signal at B. This difference signal is then fed to the transistor T4 which is so biased as to permit energization thereof by signals above a predetermined value which corresponds to the amount of slip which can occur before the slip is regarded as excessive. The transistor T4 when energized operates a relay RL1 which is connected via a diode D5 to the transistor in the circuit corresponding to the other front wheel. Energization of relay RL1 or RL2 causes the valve 17 or 18, as the case may be, to reduce the pressure in the corresponding front or rear brake cylinders. A network R4, R5, D4, C3 is effective as a delay storage network to permit a fixed rate of delay of the last received signal in the event of all wheels locking at once so as to ensure that a reference signal is always available for the comparison amplifiers. If the nearside and offside wheels are to be compared provision may be made to compensate for unequal angular velocities arising from cornering. Such compensation may be a signal applied to the apparatus indicative of the linear velocity of the vehicle and the radius of the turning circle or alternatively means may be provided to render the apparatus inoperative in the event of the vehicle traversing a turning circle of less than a predetermined radius, such an amount being indicated by the steering wheel. The invention may be applied to a wheeled road vehicle for the purpose of preventing wheel spin during acceleration. If the angular velocity of the two compared wheels differs by more than a predetermined amount the driving force may be relieved on all driven wheels, e.g. by throttling back the engine, easing the clutch or braking the driving wheels or at least the wheel whose angular velocity is excessive. If only the driving wheel on one side of the vehicle is unable to grip means may be effective to lock the differential. The invention may also be employed for detecting a difference in angular velocity of wheels arising from a difference in radius caused by the tyre on one becoming defective due to a puncture or leaking air valve. This indication may energize a light or other warning means. The invention may also be applied to metal rolling mills, the second body being a sheet of metal and the members being the rollers of the mill.",WESTINGHOUSE BRAKE & SIGNAL,BROOKS WILLIAM HENRY,,https://lens.org/140-299-431-126-875,Granted Patent,no,0,14,3,3,0,B60L3/10;;B60T8/17613;;G01P3/56;;H02P5/50;;Y02T10/64,B60L3/10;;B60T8/1761;;B60T8/64;;G01P3/56;;H02P5/50,B7D DXA           DXA;;B7H HXG           HXG;;B7H HXG           HXG-REM;;B7H H101          HXG-REM;;B7H H202          HXG-REM;;B7H H204          HXG-REM;;B7H H206          HXG-REM;;B7H H214          HXG-REM;;B7H H220          HXG-REM;;B7H H301          HXG-REM;;B7H H303          HXG-REM;;B7H H307          HXG-REM;;F2F FDB           FDB734;;F2F F734          FDB734;;G1N NAAJ          AAJF;;G1N NAAJF         AAJF;;G1N N1A2P         AAJF;;G1N N1A3B         AAJF;;G1N N1D7          AAJF;;G1N N3S1A         AAJF;;G1N N3S15         AAJF;;G1N N4A           AAJF;;G1N N4C           AAJF;;G1N N7E1          AAJF;;G1N N7F           AAJF;;G3N NGA           GA;;G3N NK            K;;G3N N251          BH;;G3N N286C         GA;;G3N N286C         K;;G3N N288A         GA;;G3N N288A         K;;G3N N373          GA;;G3N N373          K;;G3N N381          GA;;G3N N381          K;;H3P PCT           PCT;;H3T TCT           TCT;;H3T TCX           TCX,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Brooks, J. W. Jan. 31. Milling ; lathes ; chucks. -Relates to an apparatus for machining lasso rings automatically. The rings are first turned on their peripheries and sides and are then finished inside by a milling-tool. The two operations may be performed consecutively in one machine. Fig. 4 shows a vertical section through the turning portion of the machine. The ring E is held by a chuck A on a revolving spindle A'. The chuck, as shown separately in Figs. 7 and 8, consists of four or more conical fingers a<1>, a<2>, a<3>, a<4>, which are drawn together by a rubber ring a<8>, and are expanded by a conical spindle F, Fig. 4, so as to hold the ring in the groove a<7>. The chuck A and the spindle F are raised and lowered by cams on the shaft D and levers c<4> and f<1> respec. tively. The outside of the ring is turned by a tool h<1>, Fig. 6, held in a slide H, which is advanced by a lever h<4> driven by a cam on the shaft D. As the outside of a ring is finished the chuck collapses, and is raised clear to allow another ring to be placed in position. A pile of ring castings is supported between angular uprights P, I<2>, shown in plan in Fig. 18, and the lowermost ring is pushed into position below the chuck A by a slide J actuated by a lever j<1> and a cam on the shaft D. The rings pass along guides formed by plates g<1>,g<2>, g<4>, g<5>, shown to a larger scale in Fig. 5, and the ring which has been turned on the outside is pushed on by the next ring into position to be milled on the inside. The ring is gripped by jaws M<1>, M<2>, Fig. 18, of which M<1> is advanced by a cam m<3>, and M<2> is set in a fixed position by a screw m<1>. The tool for milling the inside of the ring is of exactly similar construction to the chuck A and is operated in the same way, milling-edges being formed in the groove a<7>. As an alternative, a pair of milling-bosses N<1>, N<2>, Fig. 23, with cutting- edges n<1>, n<2>, may be used to machine the insides of the rings. The chuck A may be used to hold the rings when turning them up by hand in an ordinary lathe, a plate being fixed on the slide-rest to stop the ring at the groove a'.",BROOKS JAMES WILLIAM,BROOKS JAMES WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/037-005-995-210-239,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Elastic-fluid turbines.-Relates to turbines of the type described in Specification No. 297, A.D. 1906, in which buckets are formed on the periphery of a rotor, and guide-passages are arranged in a surrounding stator in such a way that the steam traverses a forwardly - progressing spiral path between the inlet and exhaust ports. The improvement lies in providing additional guide-passages in the stator so that part of the steam traverses a rearwardlyprogressing spiral path. The Figure shows a group of rotor buckets and two inlets a, a<1>. Passages c in the stator lead the steam exhausting from one side of the buckets back again to impact repeatedly before reaching the exhausts b, b<1>. Similar passages c<1> are arranged to lead steam in a rearward direction with repeated impacts until the exhausts b<1>, b are reached.

These cushion elements are custom-fitted to the individual patient by injecting an incipiently reacting and foaming, fluorocarbon-blown polyurethane chemical system into the space between a rigid mold box and an elastic membrane which is fitted over the open face of the mold box and which is deformably engaged by the appropriate portions of the patient's torso. The foaming mixture is injected in predetermined excess volume and expands against the physical resistance of the patient's body where contact is made with the corresponding regions of the elastic membrane; and this forcible engagement produces selective densification of the foam where a high degree of body support is required. Elsewhere, the foam expands more freely and stretchably inflates the membrane to generate graduatedly less dense regions matably contoured to fit or partially embrace the patient.

Elastic-fluid turbines. - Relates to the special construction of fixed and running blades for turbines of the kind in which the motive fluid is caused to follow a helical path partly in the periphery of the rotor, and partly in the adjacent surface of the stator. The rotor blades a are formed with curved outer edges, which are not symmetrical. The blades are bound together by a support n. The motive fluid enters the blades between the edges b c and is discharged between the edges d e, so that it follows an approximately semicircular path. The inlet portions of the blades form an angle a, Fig. 3, with a tangent to the rotor periphery ; this angle is less than the angle # formed by the outlet portions of the blades. The construction of the standing blades is such that the fluid emerging from a certain number of rotor blades is passed across to the inlet sides of rotor blades situated further forward. The direction of flow is indicated by arrows. The edges g h and i j are shaped similarly to the adjacent edges of the rotor buckets. The part situated between the points g i m, Fig 2, is approximately plane, radial, and centrally situated relatively to the rotor buckets. The part g h k is bent over and makes an acute angle with the periphery of the rotor. The part i j m is approximately radial. The distances between the standing blades increase progressively to alow for expansive working.

Brooks, W. J. Dec. 23. Motor road vehicles.- The starting-handle for the motor is interlocked with the change-speed mechanism, clutch, or the like, so that it cannot be brought into action unless the motor is disconnected from the wheels ; the mechanism may also retard the spark and relieve the compression. In the form shown in Figs. 1, 2, and 3, the starting- shaft S is provided with a collar A or the equivalent, which may pass the notch in the locking-member B, as shown in Fig. 2, when the shaft is displaced longitudinally to engage the engine shaft. The member B is displaced at right-angles to the axis of the shaft, and is so connected to the changespeed lever or the like that it is in the position shown in Fig. 2 only when the change-lever is in the neutral position. If the change-lever is in gear, the lips L prevent operation of the starting-handle, as shown in Fig. 3. The locking-member may be pivoted and act in a similar way, and the lips L may be enlarged or even arranged to encircle the collar, as shown in Fig. 10. In a modified form, the locking-member engages the clutch at the inner end of the starting-shaft. In the form shown in Fig. 16, the collar A is formed on a sleeve A<1> connected to the shaft S by a slot b and pin a. The collar A is not free to move axially, and is formed with a notch with which the locking-piece B may engage, the locking-piece being also notched. The shaft S, although it can be moved longitudinally, cannot be rotated unless the locking-piece is in a suitable position with the engine disconnected from the road wheels. The locking-piece in this case may have a sliding motion. In another form the locking-piece is in the form of a bolt sliding at right-angles to the shaft and operated from a cranked spindle. The locking-member may be connected to the change-speed lever, clutch, &c. by link-work or flexible connexions. In order to retard the spark and relieve the compression, some part of the connecting link-work may be formed with a swelling e, Fig. 24, which raises a rod j, against the resistance of spring k when the starting-handle is unlocked, the rod being connected to the spark-advance and valves.",BROOKS WILLIAM JOHN,BROOKS WILLIAM JOHN,,https://lens.org/067-487-061-127-020,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

As shown, alternate teeth 1 are made separate from the body of the core, which is formed with projections or teeth 3. Channels 4 are made in the core to receivethe separate teeth. Fig. 1 shows one method of securing the teeth, the stampings on each side of the ventilating-space 10 being kept in place by brass pieces 11, 13 with a wedge 14 between. To facilitate insertion, each stamping may be slightly bent along its centre line, and flattened when pressed into position.

    A method and mechanism for booting an operating system in a Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks (RAID) is disclosed. The method includes: searching for a copy of a RAID driver on at least one boot partition of a disk in the disk array, wherein copies of the RAID driver are stored in boot partitions of at least two of the disks in the disk array; and loading the RAID driver, if the RAID driver is found. In the preferred embodiment, the boot partitions of the disks are searched until a working copy of the RAID driver is found. The RAID driver is loaded and the RAID implemented. The operating system may then be booted. In this manner, the need for a Flash memory device for storing the RAID driver is eliminated. The method and mechanism can be implemented in existing systems not designed to support software RAID.

Impact wheels. - Relates to impact - wheels in which the working fluid is caused to pass through the motor in a spiral path partly in the periphery of the rotor and partly in the adjacent surface of the stator, and consists essentially in making the inlet sides of the buckets or vanes more nearlv radial than the outside sides thereof. Figs. 3, 4, and 5 show the blocks used to form the buckets, in which 4 is the inlet and 5 the outlet side. These blocks are held in position by the rotor as shown in Fig. 12, in which the passage is shown of elliptical cross-section. The buckets may be formed of plates, Figs. 7 and 9, arranged alternately. Owing to the increased inclination of the outlet sides, the passage in the buckets decreases in crosssection towards the outlet when the core is placed centrally. To cause the cross-section to increase, the core may be placed out of centre. Fig. 15 shows a construction having two inlets 55, 56 which communicate with passages 57 passing halfway round the motor. The steam then passes into sets of vanes 60, 68 respectively, and from these into parallel pairs of sets of vanes 64, 65 and 69, 70. The rings of buckets may be of increasing diameter, and balancing-pistons may be used. To insert the buckets in rotors of the form shown in Fig. 12, the parts are first clamped on a cylindrical former and then transferred as a whole to one half of the rotor.",SAYERS WILLIAM BROOKS,SAYERS WILLIAM BROOKS,,https://lens.org/171-586-737-805-092,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Combined electrical and mechanical systems; non - automatic; electrical systems, non - auto - matic.-Each section of track is provided with a ramp formed of two insulated sections reversely inclined so as to co-operate with apparatus as described in Specification 13,242/13, and each section of the ramp is connected and disconnected from a source of energy by contacts on switches controlled by the semaphore signals, and the circuit to the section first engaged by a train contact also passes through a switch which is opened shortly after the circuit is completed by a train over that section of ramp. An auxiliary ramp is also provided by which the train is stopped if the signal just passed has not been returned to danger or if the track relay for the section in which the train is, has not opened its local contacts. Fig. 1 shows a length of track for traffic from right to left divided into insulated sections A, B, C, D with three-position semaphore signals 12<a>, 12<b>, 12<c> manually or electrically operated for each section and ramps 4 at the exit end of each section the circuits to which are controlled by track relays 15, contact member 21 on the semaphore, and contacts 30, 31 on a spindle 27 controlled by the semaphore and by an electro-magnetic detent 36. The ramps 4 have two insulated conducting-portions 6, 5 and a member 8 at each end which serves to raise slightly the collecting-shoe on the engine. The portions 6, 5 are inclined upwards towards the insulating-point between them, so that the engine-shoe is first raised and then falls while passing over the ramp, and does or does not receive current from the portions 6, 5 according to the state of the sections of track ahead, the signals and brakes being operated and controlled as described in Specification 13,242/13, according to the energizing or otherwise of the magnets 103<1>, 163 on the train. When the section A only is occupied, the signal 12<a> is at danger, signal 12<b> at caution, and signal 12<c> at clear. Under these circumstances, a train on section D about to pass into section C engages the ramp 6 and receives current from the battery 19 through the closed contacts 20 of the energized relay 15, segment 21, wire 41, magnet 38, and contact 31, the rail 1 serving as return conductor. The magnet 38 withdraws the detent 36 and allows the spindle 27 to rotate slowly under control of a dash-pot, thus opening the circuit of the ramp 6 at the contact 31 but not before the train has passed clear of the ramp section 6. At ramp 5 current is received by the engine from battery 19 through segment 21 as above and thence by wire 44. The engine thus receives current from both parts of the ramp. As soon as the train has passed into the section C the signal 12<c> should be set to danger, thus restoring the spindle 27 to close the contact 30 in the circuit to the ramp 45, which then energizes the engine apparatus on passing, but if the signal is not replaced, the train is stopped. The train on section C should de-energize the relay 15, which opens the circuit to the ramps 5, 6 in its rear. With the signal 12b at caution, the ramp 6 is energized as previously described, but the ramp 5 is cut out of circuit by the insulated portion of the segment 21. Fig. 2 shows an alternative arrangement for connexion of the ramp 45, which is energized from a battery 50 when the track relay 15 is de-energized while this battery is disconnected therefrom and connected to the segment 21 when the relay is energized. By this means, the train is stopped if the armature of relay 15 sticks or is held up by leakage currents.",MURRAY WILLIAM BROOKS,MURRAY WILLIAM BROOKS,,https://lens.org/189-052-310-805-058,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,B61L3/10,B61L3/10,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   A method and mechanism for booting an operating system in a Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks (RAID) is disclosed. The method includes: searching for a copy of a RAID driver on at least one boot partition of a disk in the disk array, wherein copies of the RAID driver are stored in boot partitions of at least two of the disks in the disk array; and loading the RAID driver, if the RAID driver is found. In the preferred embodiment, the boot partitions of the disks are searched until a working copy of the RAID driver is found. The RAID driver is loaded and the RAID implemented. The operating system may then be booted. In this manner, the need for a Flash memory device for storing the RAID driver is eliminated. The method and mechanism can be implemented in existing systems not designed to support software RAID.

Gas turbines.-Elastic-fluid turbines are provided with rotors carrying longitudinal vanes co-operating with a series of guide passages in the casing so that motive fluid is caused to act repeatedly upon the rotor while flowing in a generally circumferential course. The guide passages increase progressively in axial dimensions to allow expansive working. Parts of the rotor may act as a turbine while other parts act simultaneously as a centrifugal fan for compressing fluids. In the case of an internalcombustion turbine, the fan part may compress the explosive mixture. A special method of setting and alining the shaft is described. A drum mounted on ball bearings is provided with a number of rows of buckets formed by circumferential and longitudinal ribs on the drum. In the outermost rows the buckets are of double pitch. Fluid is admitted by way of a nozzle j, and after acting on a vane rebounds into a guide passage k, which leads it to a bucket further in advance. The motive fluid continues to flow circumferentially round the rotor by passing into buckets and guide passages alternately until it finally reaches the exhaust. The nozzle j is arranged to coact with the central row a' of buckets, and the succeeding guide passages k increase in width to bring first a row of buckets a<2> into action, then a row a3, and so on, as shown in dotted lines in Fig. 1. More than one nozzle with its co-operating guide passages may be arranged round the periphery of the turbine. Where a single nozzle j is provided, the alining-device shown in Fig. 1 may be fitted. The apertures in the casing for the reception of the stuffing-boxes g have a small clearance, and are provided with adjusting- screws g<2>, by means of which the rotor may be advanced towards the inlet j. In a modification, the stator is provided with a duplicate set of guide passages k<1>, Fig. 3, arranged in a reverse direction, so that part of the apparatus acts as a turbine and part as a centrifugal pump. When used as an internal-combustion turbine, the pump portion is used to compress the explosive mixture. Explosion takes place in the first guide passage, which is fitted with a recess n<1> for the reception of an ignition device, or, alternatively, the ignition device may be situated in a cavity n communicating direct with the buckets. The distance between the delivery port of the pump section and the inlet end of the first guide passage is greater than the distance between adjacent rotor vanes, so that the rotor acts in itself as a cut-off valve for the intermittent supply of explosive mixture.",SAYERS WILLIAM BROOKS,SAYERS WILLIAM BROOKS,,https://lens.org/187-791-559-403-413,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Sayers, W. B. Dec. 8. Electric railways and tramways with overhead supply conductors and return conductors in a slotted conduit. Conductors; conduits.-An insulated return conductor is placed in a conduit, and is earthed near the generator, transformer station, or other source of current, so that the difference of potential between the return and the conduit is limited to the drop in the return. Corrosion and electric disturbances are thus prevented. The conduit may be formed by the running rail a and a guard rail i of various forms, which may be connected by metal junction pieces a<1>, bedded on concrete &c., and furnished with boxes &c. t at intervals. Or the conduit may consist of a slotted pipe h as in Fig. 9. The conductor f may be held in an insulator g by the clamps o, o and set-screw q, Fig. 6, or by clamps 12, 13 and nut 14, Fig. 9, or may be soldered to a ring 19 clamped on an oil insulator, Fig. 12. Or, as shown in Fig. 11, it may consist of a strip f held on insulators secured by bolts passing through the sides of the conduit. The insulators may be screwed into one side of the conduit, or otherwise held therein The conductor is strained by the screw-carried roller v pulling in a loop at its end, Fig. 8, and it may be connected to feeders at intervals as at x. Collectors.-The brush 1, Fig. 6, for the return conductor and its insulating-shank 6 is supported by a hanger 2 under the influence of two springs. One spring, shown at 4, presses the brush on to the conductor, and the other allows the shank to turn up in case of obstruction.",SAYERS WILLIAM BROOKS,SAYERS WILLIAM BROOKS,,https://lens.org/027-674-433-898-145,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Brooks, B., and Holt, W. Oct. 23. [Cognate Application, 7950/14.] Turning-gear.-The armature shaft 2 of an electric starting-motor is ex tended and screwed, a pinion 3 acting as a nut on the thread. The pinion carries a robber disk 10, and is normally free from teeth 9 fixed or formed on the fly-wheel. When the motor is started, inertia of the pinion is sufficient to cause it to move axially until the disk bears on the fly-wheel; the friction between the disk and the fly - wheel then causes complete engagement of the pinion. A spring 5 acts as a buffer to the axial movement of the pinion. When the engine picks up speed, the pinion being moved out of gear, a light torsion spring 12 assists to keep the pinion disengaged. In a modification the screw-threads are replaced by a block 14, Fig. 4, on a shaft on which a pinion is fixed and a groove 15 in the armature shaft. When the electric motor is to be used as a generator, a friction-wheel 10, Fig. 4, integral with the pinion may be used to co-act with the wheel 19 on the engine shaft. The pinion may have worm teeth -or be replaced by a friction-wheel.

C., Lowson, J., [trading as Martin & Co., W. C.], and Sayers, W. B. Oct. 13. Casings.-Consists in encasing the rotating parts of dynamo-electric machines, for use on board ship &c., within a system of overlapping plates, rings, and abutments so arranged that, while allowing efficient ventilation to take place, any liquid &c. which may enter is confined to the casing and is drained out again. The armature 1, Fig. 1, rotates within a fixed field magnet 2 having an annular yoke 3 to which are screwed rings 4 having outwardly-facing channels 4<a>. Plates 6 curved inwardly at their peripheries are secured to and overlap the rings 4, and their lower parts are perforated for the escape of liquid. Abutments 9 situated opposite to the central openings 8 in the plates 6 are cast integral with the rings 4 and bearings 11 for the armature shaft 12. In a modification, the channel 4<a> of each ring faces inwardly, overlapping the corresponding plate 6, and is itself perforated, the abutments 9 being formed as flanges on the pedestal bearings. In another modification, in order to cause the air entering or leaving by the passages 7, 8 to take a more or less sinuous path, each ring 4 is provided with three channels at its periphery, the outermost of which faces inwardly while the other two face outwardly, and the adjacent plate 6 is formed with two inwardly-curved projections which enter into the recesses thus produced in the ring 4 ; the abutments 9 and the edges of the plates 6 around the passages 8 are also formed with mutuallyoverlapping projections, the yoke being perforated in this modification. In all cases, the plates 6 are made in halves to facilitate access to the interior of the machine. The shaft 12 may have attached at one end a fan device 13, Fig. 5, which is adapted to draw in air through the opposite end of the machine and to expel it through the adjacent opening 7. One of the abutments 9 is fixed to the fan device, and the upper half of one or both of the plates 6 is hinged at 6<c> to the adjacent ring 4.",MARTIN WILLIAM CRAMMOND;;LOWSON JAMES;;SAYERS WILLIAM BROOKS,MARTIN WILLIAM CRAMMOND;;LOWSON JAMES;;SAYERS WILLIAM BROOKS,,https://lens.org/191-169-857-973-013,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

ROLLS-ROYCE Ltd. 7 Feb., 1967 [14 Feb., 1966], No. 6461/66. Heading B7G. [Also in Division F1] A gas turbine jet engine comprises an exhaust duct which is provided with a thrust reverser or thrust spoiler which is movable between inoperative and operative positions, also a plurality of angularly spaced-apart silencing flaps which are movable between an inoperative position, in which they do not impede the flow of turbine exhaust gases through the exhaust duct and an operative position in which they obstruct angularly spaced apart portions only of the exhaust duct but in which the turbine exhaust gases may flow downstream between them. The thrust reverser or thrust spoiler comprises a plurality of angularly spaced-apart flaps interposed between and alternating with the silencer flaps. The engine shown is a gas turbine ducted fan engine of the two-shaft, front fan type, the turbine exhaust gases discharging through a duet 3 defined between an inner wall 4 and outer casing structure 2. A series of thrust reverser flap members 7 are pivotally mounted at 16 and are movable between the inoperative position shown in full lines and an operative position shown in chain-dotted lines by means of actuators not shown.

The writing light is amplitude modulated by a signal containing the digital data to be stored. Horizontal and vertical deflectors deflect the beams to scan horizontally and vertically in response to control signals. The scanning beams are focused to a focal point to impinge upon a stationary medium manufactured of a dry film having submicron electrically photosensitive particles embedded in a thermoplastic layer mounted on a substantially transparent electrically conductive substrate. The particles are insensitive to light at the reading light wavelength. The particles are initially uncharged and the film is sensitive to light after receiving an initial surface charge. The regions of the medium with the charged particles and with the uncharged particles cause differing angular rotation of the electric and magnetic field vectors of the reading light, with the degree of rotation of the reading light after passing through the medium indicating whether a digital data bit of one or zero is recorded. A fixed mask is positioned in the focal plane of the lens and in juxtaposition with the medium. The mask is opaque to the writing and reading light beams and has a matrix of rows and columns of transparent apertures. The apertures define the extent of the regions of the medium with the charged and uncharged particles. A Senarmont polarization compensator is positioned to be exposed to the reading light beam after passing through the mask apertures and the medium and is responsive only to the incident of the reading light thereon. The compensator detects the angular rotation of the fields by measuring the reading light beam intensity and relating it to a   predetermined reference, and modulates the amplitude of an indicator signal from a photodiode so as to produce an output signal if rotation is detected indicative of a recorded information bit of stored digital data at a one or a zero binary state. Related control circuitry provides the scan control signals, and a heatable erasure pad selectively erases portions of the medium.

ROLLSROYCE Ltd. 14 June, 1969, No. 30258/69. Heading F2R. A gas turbine jet propulsion ducted fan engine 22 is supported from an aircraft by a beam 18 which penetrates the fan duct 30 and connects with the engine proper, an outer skin or casing 20 surrounding the beam 18 and the space 34 between them receiving air from the duct 30 and guiding it to a slot-shaped outlet 36 on the beam outer surface downstream of the duct outlet, whereby to re-energize the boundary layer air flow. The beam 18 may be two separate pieces, or may be one member which passes through the aircraft fuselage 10, and in either case forms the central rigid structure of stub wings 14, 16 projecting one from each side of the fuselage 10. Normally the slight obstruction 32 presented by the beam 18 and casing 20 extending across the duct 30 would cause an unacceptable disruption in the fan duct air flow because air would strike the upstream edge of casing 20 and be deflected to either side thereby, thus deflecting adjacent ambient air and so spoiling the aerodynamic efficiency of the duct. Moreover, undesirable pressure fields would be created between the fan blade trailing edges and the upstream edge of casing 20, which would have a hammering effect on the fan blades. However, that portion 20a of the upstream edge of casing 20 which lies across duct 30 is cut back (Fig. 2) so as to remove these pressure fields. Lateral deflection of the fan air is substantially obviated for the cut edge of casing 20 is so thin as to cause little or no deflection of air passing outwardly of it. The air passing through space 34 is caused to expand spanwise of the stub wings 14, 16 by shaping the space 34 such that its cross-sectional area increases in a downstream direction. The expelling of the air through outlet 36 over the full span of the stub wings 14, 16 re-energizes the boundary layer air flow over these wings, causing it to flow smoothly and rapidly, instead of breaking away from the wing upper surface and creating vortices and adverse pressures. In an alternative construction (Fig. 3, not shown), the invention is applied to a pylon by means of which a ducted fan engine is suspended from the under-surface of an aircraft main wing.",ROLLS ROYCE,MORRIS GEOFFREY WILLIAM;;BROOKS LESLIE JOHN,,https://lens.org/120-564-015-356-494,Granted Patent,no,0,13,1,1,0,B64C11/001;;B64C21/04;;B64C21/06;;B64D29/04;;F02K1/52;;B64C2230/04;;Y02T50/10;;B64D29/04;;B64C21/04;;B64C21/06,B64C11/00;;B64C21/04;;B64C21/06;;B64D29/04;;F02K1/52,F2R R             -;;F2R RB            RB;;U1S S1839;;U1S S1854;;U1S S1989,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

WESTING- HOUSE BRAKE & SIGNAL CO. Ltd. June 19, 1963 [July 19, 1962], No. 2700/62. Heading F2D. [Also in Division H3] To interrupt for a predetermined time the supply of fuel to an engine driving a vehicle transmission, an oil-operated and driver controlled switch S is opened to render conducting a transistor T1 and thus feed a current pulse through a condenser C to the base of a transistor T2, which accordingly becomes non-conducting and in turn renders a transistor T3 and a power transistor T4 conducting, the latter energizing a solenoid L and causing a fuel interrupter I to become operative. As soon as the transistor T1 conducts, charging of the condenser C is begun through a resistor R2. After a period determined from the time constant of the circuit C, R2, the condenser is fully charged and is thus able so to bias the transistor T2 that it once more conducts, rendering the transistors T3, T4 non-conducting and re-opening the fuel interrupter I. Re-opening of the fuel interrupter I is not affected by keeping the switch S open longer than the predetermined time, since the condenser C is then merely maintained charged.",WESTINGHOUSE BRAKE & SIGNAL,BROOKS WILLIAM HENRY;;ILES DOUGLAS JAMES,,https://lens.org/194-525-948-472-668,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H03K17/64;;H03K3/284,H03K3/284;;H03K17/64,F2D DCA           DCA(E);;F2D DC059         DCA(E);;F2D DC080         DCA(E);;F2D DC085         DCA(E);;H3P PAMR          PAMR;;H3T TPMR          TPMR,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Fluid-pressure brake control systems. WESTINGHOUSE BRAKE & SIGNAL CO. Ltd. Oct. 16, 1962 [Nov. 22, 1961], No. 41777/61. Heading F2F. [Also in Division G3] When a signal representing the rate of change of peripheral velocity of a wheel of a vehicle exceeds a predetermined value, indicative that the wheel is slipping or sliding, a force, e.g. a fluid-pressure braking force, applied to the wheel is modified until a desired wheel-speed is reached. An A.C. voltage is induced in the coil of a pick-up device associated with a monitored wheel at a frequency directly proportional to the wheel-speed. The output from the pick-up is fed through a squaring and pulse-shaping circuit and discriminator to a differentiator, producing a signal which indicates the rate of change of frequency. A limiter unit provides a signal to a slide corrector unit and a spin corrector unit when the acceleration or deceleration of the wheel is outside permissible limits. As shown, the output from the pick-up is applied at terminal 11 associated with transistor TR1 which clips the positive half-cycles of the applied waveform and provides a signal to a pulse-shaping circuit comprising transistor TR2. The pulse output is applied to a diode pump circuit comprising capacitors C3, C4, so developing a D.C. signal across resistor R12 which is differentiated in circuit R13, C5. The resulting signal is amplified by transistor TR3. A first branch circuit responds to negative signals from the transistor TR3 corresponding to acceleration and comprises transistors TR4, TR5 and TR6. A second branch circuit, comprising transistors TR7, TR8 and TR9 responds to positive signals corresponding to deceleration. When the acceleration exceeds a predetermined value, transistor TR10 energizes relay 14 to initiate sanding operation. If the signal is greater than that which corresponds to this value, transistor TR11 conducts to energize relay 15 for pinch braking. When the signal is still greater, transistor TR12 energizes relay 16 and the traction motors are cut out. Due to the delay provided by capacitors C6, C7, the wheel passes into the decelerating condition and the sign of the signal applied to transistor TR3 changes so that the circuit TR7-TR9 becomes effective to maintain the appropriate correction until the wheel velocity approaches the speed of the vehicle. For correcting slide, transistor TR10 is rendered conductive if the deceleration exceeds a predetermined value whilst transistor TR13 energizes relay 17 for brake reduction at a still higher value. The slide correction is maintained until the wheel begins to accelerate and control of the wheel is taken over by increasing friction with the track and the signal representing rate of change of speed falls within a permissible range of values. Interlocking may be provided by cut-out relays in circuit with transistors TR6, TR9, to ensure that slip correction and slide correction do not occur concurrently.",WESTINGHOUSE BRAKE & SIGNAL,BROOKS WILLIAM HENRY;;CLEMENTS ROBERT PETER,,https://lens.org/113-999-970-560-986,Granted Patent,no,0,2,3,3,0,B60T8/3235;;B60L3/10;;B60L2200/26;;B60T8/1703;;B60T8/324;;B60T8/3245;;B60T8/48;;B64C25/42;;Y02T10/64,B60L3/10;;B60T8/17;;B60T8/32;;B60T8/48;;B64C25/42,F2F FDB           FDB731/753;;F2F F731          FDB731/753;;F2F F753          FDB731/753;;G3N NGA           GA;;G3N NK            NK;;G3N N286C         GA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Jeffreys, E. A., and Sayers, W. B. May 7. Motor road vehicles. - A power - transmission device comprises an oscillating member influenced through an elastic member by an inertia member so that the driving - member is periodically subjected to and relieved from load. It is stated to be applicable as a change-speed driving-gear on a motor-vehicle. In the form shown in Fig. 2, one fork c of a universal joint is secured to the driven shaft b, while the other fork d is inclined to the driving-shaft a and connected thereto by a crankarm e. The forks c, d are connected by a crossshaped piece g. The limb of the piece g that adjoins the fork c is a hollow shaft g<1>. Fly-wheels i are supported on the ends of a spindle h passing through the shaft g', the rim of each wheel i being connected by a spring and a flexible strap k to the shaft g<1>. During each revolution of the shaft a relatively to the shaft b, the shaft g<1> makes a double oscillation about its own axis. Oscillating rotary motion of the wheels i is accompanied by bending of the springs j and winding of the straps k round the shaft g<1>. The arrangement is such that the shaft b is driven by a series of impulses of value depending upon the obliquity of the fork d, which is adjusted by a clamp e<2>. The combined elastic and inertia system yieldingly locks the shaft b to the shaft a in such a way as to form a powertransmission mechanism of velocity-ratio automatically variable with the load. Fig. 6 shows another typical form. The oscillating system resisting the free oscillation of the shaft g<1>, arranged as before, comprises a pair of massive pistons q<1> sliding in cylinders q' in a casing o, which forms the driven gear-element. Other pistons r closing the ends of the cylinders q<2> are coupled by connecting-rods to a balancing-lever r<2>.

The writing light is amplitude modulated by a signal containing the digital data to be stored. Horizontal and vertical deflectors deflect the beams to scan horizontally and vertically in response to control signals. The scanning beams are focused to a focal point to impinge upon a stationary medium manufactured of a dry film having submicron electrically photosensitive particles embedded in a thermoplastic layer mounted on a substantially transparent electrically conductive substrate. The particles are insensitive to light at the reading light wavelength. The particles are initially uncharged and the film is sensitive to light after receiving an initial surface charge. The regions of the medium with the charged particles and with the uncharged particles cause differing angular rotation of the electric and magnetic field vectors of the reading light, with the degree of rotation of the reading light after passing through the medium indicating whether a digital data bit of one or zero is recorded. A fixed mask is positioned in the focal plane of the lens and in juxtaposition with the medium. The mask is opaque to the writing and reading light beams and has a matrix of rows and columns of transparent apertures.

Feedback from the BFS/mud slurry flowrate is fed to the activator injector pump drive system to regulate ale addition rate of the activating agent in response to varying conditions, such as mud flowrate. The injection rate target can also be adjusted to compensate for any changes in downhole temperature. The risk of fouling surface equipement and the casing internal diameter is minimized because the activation agent is added very close in time to when the BFS/mud mixture enters the cementing head.

[May 4, 1951 [May 25, 1950], No. 13103/50. Class 83 (iii). Feed mechanism for use with a fluid-operated tool 2 comprises a piston 12 connected to the tool, a cylinder 11 for mounting the tool, and means for supplying fluidpressure to allow the piston 12 to be advanced or retracted without interrupting the operation of the tool. A drilling unit 1 is attached to the front end of the piston 12 and a compressed-air supply is connected to the cylinder 11 at 8. The pistonrod 9 contains a piston valve 19 engaged by a spring 23 adjacent ports 22 in the rod. The rod 9 also contains a fixed plug 29 engaged by a spring 28 which urges a valve 26 away from its seating 27. The valve 26 is carried on a rod 24. which passes loosely through the valve 19 and a metering screw therein and carries lock-nuts 25. In operation, air passing through the connection 8 rotates the drill in known manner and pushes the piston valve 19 back against its spring to close the ports 22. Air then meters through the valve 19 and forces the piston 12 slowly to the left, thus feeding the drill. The valve 26 is arrested when the nuts 25 engage a member 17 in the cylinder and eventually the seat 27 moves up to the valve and cuts off the pressure supply to the piston 12. The pressure within the piston-rod 9 then becomes balanced on each side of the valve piston 19 and the valve is moved to uncover the ports 22 and allow a spring 14 to withdraw the piston 12 and the tool. The pressure supply to the tool, however, is uninterrupted and maintains the valve 26 in its closed position. Thus the air supply must be switched off before the drill can again be fed into the work. In a modification, retraction of the tool causes a valve 37, Fig. 2, to cut off the air supply to the tool.

Jan.14, 1970, No.1842/70. Headings G1G, F1J. A gas turbine power plant comprises an outer casing, a main air intake at the upstream end of the casing and a gas or air outlet at the downstream end of the casing, there being first restricting means movable between an inoperative position in which it is fully retracted and an operative position in which it extends partially to obturate the main intake; also an auxiliary air intake defined in the outer casing and second restricting means movable between an operative and an inoperative position to permit and to prevent respectively ingress of air into the auxiliary intake. The engine shown in Fig. 1 is a gas turbine ducted fan engine comprising a fan 13 mounted in a duct defined by a fan casing 11, 12. A series of flap members 18 are pivotably mounted at 19 adjacent the upstream end of the fan casing being movable between an operative position shown in Fig. 1 in which they partially obturate the air intake and a retracted position in which the flap members are received in recesses 24 formed in the inner wall 12 of the fan casing in which position they do not impede air-flow into the main air intake. The flaps are movable by a ball-screw jack 20 acting through links 22 which incorporate shock absorbers. An auxiliary air intake duct 31 is provided downstream of the flaps 18, the duct 31 having associated therewith flap members 30 which are movable between an operative position shown in full lines and an inoperative position shown in broken lines in which they respectively permit and prevent air-flow through the auxiliary air intake. The auxiliary flaps 30 move conjointly with the main flaps 18. The flaps are movable to their operative positions to prevent passage of sound waves from the fan assembly out through the intake. Means may be provided to increase the area of the discharge nozzle when the intake flaps are moved to their operative positions. In Fig. 6 the inner wall 16 of the fan duct which surrounds the gas turbine engine 17 comprises pairs of flap members 130, 131 which are pivotally inter-connected at 133 and have a pivotal connection to the wall 16 at 132 and a sliding connection to the wall at 134. The flaps are movable by actuator 35 between a minimum nozzle area position shown in full lines and a maximum nozzle area position shown in broken lines. In Fig. 3 the downstream end portion 28a of the fan casing is axially movable in a downstream direction as indicated by chain-dotted lines to define an annular passage for thrust spoiling. Arrangements are provided in Fig. 3 for discharge of jets of air from the flaps 18 to prevent eddying downstream of the flaps when in their projected positions.",ROLLS ROYCE,POUCHER MICHAEL;;BROOKS LESLIE JOHN;;MORRIS GEOFFREY WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/193-396-998-925-157,Granted Patent,no,0,7,5,5,0,F02C7/045;;F02K1/72;;Y10T137/0536;;Y02T50/60;;Y10T137/0536;;F02K1/72;;F02C7/045;;Y02T50/60,F02C7/045;;F02K1/72,F1G G11           G11;;F1J J1F2C2        J2A1;;F1J J1F2X         J2A1;;F1J J2A1A         J2A1,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   Control of a multi-variable process involves multi-dimensional representation of the values (Qa-Qh) of the process variables according to individual coordinate axes (Xa-Xh), and response based on sets of values for the process-variables accumulated from multiple, earlier operations of the process. An acceptable range (UL-LL) for each process variable due to the current values of the other variables is defined from the accumulated values, and the existence of an alarm condition in which the current value (Qg) of a variable lies outside the range defined for it, is detected and displayed (UC) on the relevant axis (Xg).

[Also in Groups XXII and XXXIII] Means for severing a reefing or release line in a parachute system (see Group XXXIII) after a time delay following a manual or automatic release action, is shown. The line (not shown) passes through an aperture 35 in a housing (Fig. 5) containing a circular cutter blade 33 eccentrically mounted on a pinion 34 engaged with a rack 36 on a bolt 11. Fig. 1 shows the bolt-operating mechanism, but not the cutting means. The bolt is slidable in a housing 10, and surrounded by a sleeve 14 having a flange 14a engageable with a flange 11a on the bolt. A spring 16 is contained between flange 14a and a shoulder 10b in the housing. The sleeve has a rack 15 engaged with a pinion 17 in mesh with a time delay gear train 13 in a part 10a of the housing. Normally, the bolt and sleeve are retained in the position shown by a pin 19. On withdrawal of the pin, spring 16 urges the sleeve to the right at a slow rate, until displacement of the sleeve disengages rack 15 from pinion 17. The sleeve then moves to the right freely, and strikes the bolt flange 11a and moves the bolt rapidly, rotating the cutter blade 33. A sleeve 25 bearing a rack and acted on by a spring 26 is also slidably mounted on bolt 11, so that when rack 15 is disengaged from pinion 17, the rack on sleeve 25 engages the pinion. By this means, when the bolt and sleeve are returned to the position shown by a cocking plunger 18, rack 15 smoothly re-meshes with pinion 17. The part 10a may be swingable about an axis to obtain small changes in the time delay.",AIRCRAFT MATERIALS LTD,BROOKS WILLIAM HENRY;;COWAN SOLOMON STANLEY;;LANCASTER ARTHUR TURNER,,https://lens.org/035-740-094-953-615,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,B64D17/34,B64D17/34,B7G G2A2B         G2;;B7G G2A4          G2;;B7G G2BX          G2;;B7G G2B5C         G2,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A combined electric switch and plug- and-socket coupling contained within a casing is provided with throwing- off mechanism, which prevents the switch contact arm from remaining in its ' on' position except when the plug has been pushed home in the socket, so that the long or earthing pin of the plug engages with the throwing-off mechanism to move it clear of the path of the contact arm. The throwing-off mechanism comprises a tension spring 23, a lever 9, 14 with cranked end 10 and insulating-block 11, a link 15, and a lever 16. The spring tends to hold the block 11 over the end 13 of the switch arm 13<x>. When the plug has been inserted, the end 9 of the lever 9, 14 is raised and the block 11 is moved to a position clear of the path of the switch arm so that the switch can be closed by turning the shaft 3<x>.

Oct.13, 1969 [Cct.24, 1968], No. 50153/69. Heading G1C. A method of correction for the tendency of a directional gyroscope to process in azimuth during banked turns of an aircraft in which is mounted due to friction at the vertical trunnions of the gyroscope caused by friction in the bearings and due to slip ring contacts comprises deriving asignalrepresenting the bank angle of the aircaft, e. g. from a gyro-vertical, and deriving from this a compensational signal representing the torques tending to effect the precession, the compensation signalbeing applied to a torque motor on the gyroscope to oppose the precession. The gyro 10 shown in the figure comprises a rotor 11 mounted in a case 12 for spinning about a normally horizontal axis 13. The case is journalled in a vertical ring 14 for rotation about an axis 15, the ring being carried in a fixed housing for rotation about an axis 18. A liquid level 19 with associated electrodes is mounted in a plate 20 rotatable about the axis 15 with the case 12, and together with a torque motor 21 maintains the spin axis 13 horizontal. In the described embodiment a directional reference is imposed on the gyroscope by a flux valve 25 whose signal is compared with that from a synchro 27 and fed to a torque motor to process the spin axis 13 about the vertical axis 18 to a desired orientation parallel to earth's magnetic field. The electrical supply to the gyro components is effected through a slip ring assembly 35 which together with the vertical journal bearings 16, 17 of the ring 14 produce an error torque during banked turns, especially after extended turns in the same direction. Since the vertical ring 14 tilts with the aircraft, the precession of the spin axis 13 will no longer be in a horizontal plane and this results in an azimuth component giving a turn error which remains after the aircraft resumes level flight. A vertical gyro 40 having a roll signal generator provides a bank angle signal. This signal is applied to an amplifier 43 controlling a relay 44 which operates when a very low voltage exists at the output of the amplifier 43. The relay controls switches 45, 46 serving to break the contacts between the level 19 and torque motor 21 and to substitute the compensation signal therefor. For small bank angles the azimuthal error will be negligible, so that the compensation signal is not applied to the torque motor 21 until the bank angle exceeds a set value, say 6 degrees. To this end a signal level detector is coupled to the synchro 41 of the vertical gyro 40, and when the detected angle exceeds 6 degrees it operates a switch 50 to supply power to the amplifier 43. The output of the synchro 41 will have a phase dependent on the direction of bank and the switches 45, 46 are arranged to supply the compensating signal to only one phase 21a, or 21b of the torque motor 21. In the described embodiment the signal level detector 41 also controls a switch 57 which renders ineffective the torque 29 slaving the gyroscope to the flux valve 25 during turns of the aircraft.",SPERRY RAND CORP,BROOKS WILLIAM NEWCOMBE JUNIOR;;MILLER GEORGE ROBERT;;RADTKE RICHARD KENNETH,,https://lens.org/052-456-375-314-156,Granted Patent,no,0,0,4,4,0,G01C19/34;;G01C19/34;;G01C19/42;;G01C19/42;;Y10T74/12;;Y10T74/12;;Y10T74/1246;;Y10T74/1246,G01C19/36;;G01C19/34;;G01C19/42;;G08G1/133,G1C C1D1          C1-2;;G1C C12A          C1-2;;G1C C12H          C1-2,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
