In one scheme, a DLL is maintained for each path, and each DLL tracks the timing of the best signal instance for the assigned path. In another scheme, a DLL is maintained for each path, and each DLL tracks the average timing of the multiple signal instances for the assigned path. To reduce timing jitter, the SINR of a signal instance may be estimated for a number of different time offsets. The loop filter for the DLL is initially updated in the normal manner.

   Techniques to control data transmissions to efficiently utilize the available air-link resources. In accordance with a method for controlling a data transmission between a transmission source (e.g., a base station) and a receiving device (e.g., a remote terminal), a current transmission at a current data rate for a current transmission interval is received. An average throughput for the data transmission is then updated to reflect the current transmission at the current data rate. The updated average throughput is compared against a threshold throughput (which has been previously characterized) supported by the receiving device. If the average throughput exceeds the threshold throughput, the transmission source is signaled to (temporarily) stop the data transmission. Subsequently, after the average throughput has dropped below the threshold throughput, the transmission source can be signaled to resume the data transmission.

A generic control circuit maintains this power estimate in a single overall gain amplification value by distributing gain to at least two amplifier stages in response to that value. By programming or hard coding a few key parameters, a generic control circuit can control a wide variety of amplifier configurations. Among the configurations supported are switched LNA, switched variable gain LNA, variable gain, and a decoupled IF and UHF variable gain LNA configuration. The invention is extendable to include multi-stage amplifier configurations. Although the preferred embodiment includes two stages, one for UHF and one for IF, three or more stages can easily be adapted. Various filtering schemes can be applied to the power estimate to tailor the temporal dynamics of gain switching. For example, a low pass filter can be applied to the UHF front end to give it a slower response than the IF stage.

A generic control circuit maintains this power estimate in a single overall gain amplification value by distributing gain to at least two amplifier stages in response to that value. By programming or hard coding a few key parameters, a generic control circuit can control a wide variety of amplifier configurations. Among the configurations supported are switched LNA, switched variable gain LNA, variable gain, and a decoupled IF and UHF variable gain LNA configuration. The invention is extendable to include multi-stage amplifier configurations. Although the preferred embodiment includes two stages, one for UHF and one for IF, three or more stages can easily be adapted. Various filtering schemes can be applied to the power estimate to tailor the temporal dynamics of gain switching. For example, a low pass filter can be applied to the UHF front end to give it a slower response than the IF stage. All of these configurations and any subset can be supported in a single generic device.",QUALCOMM INC,BLACK PETER J,QUALCOMM INCORPORATED (1998-08-06),https://lens.org/012-816-550-914-139,Granted Patent,yes,7,89,15,15,0,H03G3/3078;;H04B1/109;;H03G3/3078;;H04B1/109;;H03F2200/294;;H03G3/3078;;H04B1/109,H03G3/20;;H03G3/30;;H04B1/10;;H04B1/16,330/129;;330/133,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In particular, the invention is directed to an artificial reef positioned within the body of water relative to a coastline. The reef includes a reef crest, being submerged periodically during tidal cycles of the body of water, and a capture area. The reef is positioned to create predetermined currents induced by waves in the body of water breaking over the crest of the reef. The capture area includes an entrance to receive material directed there into from the bed of the body of water, and the entrance of the capture area faces substantially away from the coastline. The material accumulated in the capture area determines the level of the bed of the body of water in the capture area which in turn effects a change in the breaking characteristics of the waves over the crest of the reef. It is envisaged the invention will be applicable for use in generating surf waves, but that in doing so, the emphasis in operation is to provide coastal protection and for building coastal beach areas normally otherwise impacted on or eroded by wave action. The currents created around the reefs may also be harnessed for generation of electricity.",BLACK KERRY PETER,BLACK KERRY PETER,,https://lens.org/012-905-268-295-017,Patent Application,yes,4,7,1,1,0,E02B3/04,E02B3/04,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Black, P. B., and Black, T. H. May 7. Cranes.-Relates to a road contact-stud system of power supply for electric traction purposes which is stated in the Provisional Specification to be also applicable for propelling and operating electric cranes &c. The contact-box A, Fig. 1, preferably a casting, is formed with a cylindrical chamber A<1> for the switching gear and a subsidiary chamber D, for holding and removing drainage, which is connected to the well-portion B of the main chamber. The cover A<2> is made of a non- magnetic hard metal or alloy, for example manganese steel. in which plugs K of highly conductive metal are fixed ; these plugs are connected with soft-iron pole-pieces P, Q. Mounted between the pole-pieces on a shaft S is an armature R, shaped so as to turn in the required direction in response to the magnetic flux but caused to return by its unaided weight when the flux ceases. When, owing to the passage of the magnets on the cars, the polepieces P, Q become magnetized, the armature is rotated and the end S' of the shaft contacts with the carbon block T and thus completes the circuit from the feeder U through the box and its cover to the car collector. To prevent the contact-studs from remaining alive after the vehicles have passed, the vehicles carry brushes which short-circuit the studs and blow the fuse should the switch have stuck. The magnets 2, Fig. 3, on the cars are placed in series with the motors, and to prevent the magnets from becoming de-energized when the resistance of the motor circuit is considerable, a suitable resistance 3, in shunt to the motor circuit, is provided. When starting the car, the accumulators 5 supply the necessary current, the switch closing when the main power circuit is broken.",BLACK PETER BLAIR;;BLACK THOMAS HART,BLACK PETER BLAIR;;BLACK THOMAS HART,,https://lens.org/167-578-541-775-640,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

In an exemplary implementation, the FIR filter is employed within a digital cellular telephone for use in smoothing a digital signal to be transmitted. The size of the required FIR filter table is minimized by exploiting constraints imposed upon the signal to be filtered and by exploiting linearity and symmetry within the filter itself. More specifically, the telephone employs a data burst randomizer to provide a data signal composed of sequences of null or 0 values and sequences of antipodal values (+1's and -1's). Hence, the permissible input combinations for the FIR filter include only patterns containing either all antipodal signals, all null signals, leading antipodal signals followed by trailing null signals, or leading null signals followed by trailing antipodal signals.

    Techniques for increased pilot detection accuracy are disclosed, which provide the benefits of increased acquisition speed, increased data rate, decreased power, and improved overall system capacity. In one aspect, pilot energy calculations corresponding to PN offsets surrounding the PN offset of a local pilot energy maximum are combined with that local pilot energy maximum resulting in a compensated, more accurate local pilot energy maximum. In another aspect, the combination of nearby energy calculations is combined with the local pilot energy maximum via a function with pre-calculated compensation factors. The pre-calculated compensation factors can be determined to minimize mean-squared error in the resultant compensated local pilot energy maximum. These factors can be calculated based on a matched filter. The techniques described herein apply equally to both access points and access terminals.

Moreover, since this method provides a mechanism for accurate set point adjustment even without a PER (FER) estimate, it can also be used to improve the accuracy of outer loop performance when such estimate becomes available. The present invention estimates a 'pilot bit error rate' (PBER) (200), where each pilot 'bit' consists of a number pilot chips distributed over a frame.

    The present invention is a novel and improved method and apparatus for performing closed loop power control. A method of implementing reverse link outer loop using only pilot signal is described. Such a method is especially useful when the data signals are only present in short burst such that packet or frame error rates (PER or FER) cannot be estimated accurately. Moreover, since this method provides a mechanism for accurate set point adjustment even without a PER (FER) estimate, it can also be used to improve the accuracy of outer loop performance when such estimate becomes available. The present invention estimates a pilot bit error rate (PBER), where each pilot bit consists of a number pilot chips distributed over a frame. In addition, it estimates the normalized variance of the signal energy (or C/I) for each packet. In addition, in the preferred embodiment, the average number of fingers in lock is also used to determine the power control set point.

In another aspect, the combination of nearby energy calculations is combined with the local pilot energy maximum via a function with pre-calculated compensation factors.

   In a transmission scheme wherein multi-slot packet transmissions to a remote station can be terminated by an acknowledgment signal from the remote station, code symbols can be efficiently packed over the multi-slot packet so that the remote station can easily decode the data payload of the multi-slot packet by decoding only a portion of the multi-slot packet. Hence, the remote station can signal for the early termination of the multi-slot packet transmission, which thereby increases the data throughput of the system.

   Techniques for increased pilot detection accuracy are disclosed, which provide the benefits of increased acquisition speed, increased data rate, decreased power, and improved overall system capacity. In one aspect, pilot energy calculations corresponding to PN offsets surrounding the PN offset of a local pilot energy maximum are combined with that local pilot energy maximum resulting in a compensated, more accurate local pilot energy maximum. In another aspect, the combination of nearby energy calculations is combined with the local pilot energy maximum via a function with pre-calculated compensation factors. The pre-calculated compensation factors can be determined to minimize mean-squared error in the resultant compensated local pilot energy maximum. These factors can be calculated based on a matched filter. The techniques described herein apply equally to both access points and access terminals.

Friction clutches; controlling clutches; reverse gearing. TWIN DISC CLUTCH CO. May 4, 1959, No. 15223/59. Class 80 (2). A multiple-disc clutch is engaged and disengaged by supplying fluid pressure to engage and release spaces on opposite sides of a fixed piston surrounded by a movable cylinder, the release space being continuously filled at low pressure and engagement being produced by supplying fluid at high pressure to the engage space, the cylinder then acting through elastic means to engage the clutch discs, a throttle controlling egress of fluid from the release space and providing cushioned clutch engagement. The clutch may be engaged either pneumatically or hydraulically. In one form, multiple discs 13, Fig. 1, between a driving shaft 10 and a driven disc carrier 14 are engaged when oil is drawn through a filter 32 from a sump 31 by a pump 30 and passed through a pipe 33, a two-position clutch control valve 34 and pipes 37, 35 to a space 22 between a flange 19 fast upon the driving shaft and a two-part piston 52, which is thereby slidden rightwards so that a Belleville spring 24 engages the clutch discs. As the volume of the space 22 increases during clutch engagement, a space 29 on the opposite side of the flange 19 decreases in volume, so that oil contained therein is forced out through a pipe 50 and through a throttling restriction 48 to pipes 44, 41 and a low pressure relief valve 42 communicating through a further pipe 43 with the sump 31. Accordingly the speed of engagement of the clutch is reduced by the restriction 48. The pressure of the oil supplied through the pipe 33 for clutch engagement is controlled by a pressure relief valve 40 having the pressure on its downstream side controlled by the pressure relief valve 42, the pressure in the pipe 44, &c. being substantially less than that in the pipe 33, &c. To disengage the clutch, the clutch control valve 34 is adjusted to connect the pipe 37, &c. and the space 22 through a pipe 38 to the sump 31. Accordingly, the pressure in the space 22 falls, but the pressure in the space 29 on the opposite side of the flange 19, which is the same as the reduced pressure in the pipe 44, is maintained, so that the two-part piston 52 is slidden leftwards towards the clutch disengaged position. A one-way valve 47 in parallel with the throttling restriction 48 now opens to allow rapid admission of oil under low pressure to the space 29 for quick disengagement of the clutch. The Belleville spring 24 cushions engagement of the clutch with gradual build-up of the clutchengaging force until maximum torque transmitting capacity is reached. As a modification, the Belleville spring 24 may be replaced by a number of helical springs 55, Fig. 2, carried in recesses 56 in the back of a piston 54. In another form, multiple disc clutches 79, 80, Fig. 3, comprising the forward and reverse drive clutches of a reverse gear having an input shaft 57, 59 and an output shaft 69, are engaged when oil under relatively high pressure is admitted through one or other of two shaft ducts 110, 124 to spaces 94, 95 in a two-part piston 93 on opposite sides of a radial flange 84 fast upon the input shaft. Oil pressure is maintained at all times in the shaft ducts 110, 124, engagement of the desired clutch being effected by increasing this oil pressure in one duct at a time to a relatively high value. To engage the forward drive clutch 79, the pressure in the duct 110 is increased and oil passes through a port 112 to open one-way valves 114 admitting the increased pressure to the space 94, so that the twopart piston 93 commences to move to the left. A number of pins 115 sliding in apertures 116 in the fixed flange 84 are formed with recesses 120 coacting with oil passages 121 to form valves. When the two-part piston 93 commences its leftwards movement from the neutral position shown, the pins 115 are slidden by the two-part piston to open large ports so that oil under pressure is admitted directly from the ports 112 to the space 94. At the same time, similar pins 129 arranged reversely to the pins 115 are slidden so that small ports 133 afford restricted passages through which oil in the space 95 can escape to ducts 134 in the radial flange 84 and thence through ports 126 to the shaft duct 124. The restricted passages opened by the pins 129 reduce the speed of the engagement of the clutch 79. Leftwards movement of the two-part piston 93 acts through a Belleville spring 88 to engage the multiple disc clutch 79, so that drive passes through a gear 67 journalled upon the input shaft 57 to a gear 68 fast upon the output shaft 69. To disengage the clutch 79, the pressure in the shaft duct 110 is reduced to the normal low pressure, and springs 96, 97 restore the two-part piston 93 to the position shown. To engage the reverse drive clutch 80, the pressure in the shaft duct 124 is increased to a higher level, opening a one-way valve 128, similar to the one-way valve 114, which admits oil to the space 95, thus commencing rightwards sliding movement of the two-part piston 93. The pins 129 are now slidden within the fixed flange 84 to open relatively large apertures 132, so that direct communication is established between the shaft duct 124 and the space 95, while the pins 115 are also slidden to open restricted passages through which the oil in the space 94 can be slowly vented to the duct 110, for gradual engagement of the clutch. When the clutch 80 has been engaged, the drive is transmitted through a gear 76 journalled upon the input shaft 59 through an idler gear 77 to a gear 78 fast upon the output shaft 69. The control circuit for the reverse gearing comprises a pump 98, Fig. 4, supplying oil to a pressure release valve 101 and a control valve 102 connected through pipes 103, 104 to the shaft ducts 110, 124. Pipes 105, 106 lead back to the sump. As a modification, the single Belleville spring may be replaced by two concentric Belleville springs 139, 140, Fig. 10, lying between a piston 141 and a stack of discs 142 engaged against a reaction ring 143. The Belleville spring may alternatively be located between the reaction ring and the stack of clutch discs, instead of between the piston and the clutch discs.",TWIN DISC CLUTCH CO,BLOCH PETER;;BLACK JAMES BENJAMIN,,https://lens.org/130-978-938-107-923,Granted Patent,no,0,8,1,1,0,F16D25/10,F16D25/10,F2D DCG           DA-M;;F2D DC050         DA-M;;F2D DC084         DA-M;;F2D DC085         DA-M;;F2D DC120         DA-M;;F2D DC122         DA-M;;F2D DC125         DA-M;;F2D DC127         DA-M;;F2D DPJ           DPJ;;F2D D701          DPJ;;F2D D709          DPJ;;F2D D711          DPJ;;F2D D719          DPJ;;F2D D722          DPJ,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The FIR filter table stores a pre-calculated output filter value for each permissible combination of input values to be filtered. Streams of input values are successively shifted into the table and corresponding output values are successively output. In an exemplary implementation, the FIR filter is employed within a digital cellular telephone for use in smoothing a digital signal to be transmitted. The size of the required FIR filter table is minimized by exploiting constraints imposed upon the signal to be filtered and by exploiting linearity and symmetry within the filter itself. More specifically, the telephone employs a data burst randomizer to provide a data signal composed of sequences of null or 0 values and sequences of antipodal values (+1's and -1's). Hence, the permissible input combinations for the FIR filter include only patterns containing either all antipodal signals, all null signals, leading antipodal signals followed by trailing null signals, or leading null signals followed by trailing antipodal signals. The FIR filter look up is configured to exploit these limitations on the input streams yielding a look up table having relatively few entries.

The FIR filter table stores a pre-calculated output filter value for each permissible combination of input values to be filtered. Streams of input values are successively shifted into the table and corresponding output values are successively output. In an exemplary implementation, the FIR filter is employed within a digital cellular telephone for use in smoothing a digital signal to be transmitted. The size of the required FIR filter table is minimized by exploiting constraints imposed upon the signal to be filtered and by exploiting linearity and symmetry within the filter itself. More specifically, the telephone employs a data burst randomizer to provide a data signal composed of sequences of null or 0 values and sequences of antipodal values (+1's and -1's). Hence, the permissible input combinations for the FIR filter include only patterns containing either all antipodal signals, all null signals, leading antipodal signals followed by trailing null signals, or leading null signals followed by trailing antipodal signals. The FIR filter look up is configured to exploit these limitations on the input streams yielding a look up table having relatively few entries.

Otherwise, the prior time offset is retained and used.",QUALCOMM INC,BLACK PETER J;;SINDHUSHAYANA NAGABHUSHANA T,,https://lens.org/043-347-121-664-755,Patent Application,yes,4,0,31,31,0,H03L7/089;;H03L7/091;;H03L7/093;;H04B7/082;;H03L7/089;;H03L7/091;;H03L7/093;;H04B7/082;;H04B7/082;;H03L7/089;;H03L7/093;;H03L7/091,H04B1/707;;H03L7/089;;H03L7/091;;H03L7/093;;H04B7/08,,1,1,058-630-508-802-655,10.1109/icc.1997.605298,"JIA-CHIN LIN ET AL: ""A modified code tracking loop for direct-sequence spread-spectrum systems on frequency-selective fading channels"", COMMUNICATIONS, 1997.

The FIR filter table stores a pre-calculated output filter value for each permissible combination of input values (102) to be filtered. Streams of input values are successively shifted into the table using a shift register (106) and corresponding output values are successively output. The telephone employs a data burst randomizer (18) to provide a data signal composed of sequences of null or 0 values and sequences of antipodal values (+1's and -1's). Hence, the permissible input combinations for the FIR filter include only patterns containing either all antipodal signals, all null signals, leading antipodal signals followed by trailing null signals, or leading null signals followed by trailing antipodal signals. The FIR filter look up is configured to exploit these limitations on the input streams yielding a look up table having relatively few entries.",QUALCOMM INC,EASTON KENNETH D;;BLACK PETER J,,https://lens.org/045-348-793-658-275,Patent Application,no,0,0,21,21,0,H03H17/0607;;H03H17/0607,H03H17/06,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Accordingly, the base station can allocate power among the RLPC Channels without having received explicit information as to the quality of the Forward Link between the base station and every remote station intended to receive the information on the RLPC Channels.",QUALCOMM INC,ESTEVES EDUARDO A;;BLACK PETER J,,https://lens.org/099-605-620-566-499,Granted Patent,no,0,0,18,18,0,H04W52/225;;H04W52/226;;H04W52/228;;H04W52/265;;H04W52/267;;H04W52/32;;H04W52/343;;H04W52/346;;H04W52/50;;H04W52/04;;H04W52/265;;H04W52/32;;H04W52/346;;H04W52/50;;H04W52/226;;H04W52/228;;H04W52/343;;H04W52/225;;H04W52/267,H04B7/005;;H04B7/26;;H04W52/22;;H04W52/26;;H04W52/32;;H04W52/34;;H04W52/50,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Streams of input values are successively shifted into the table and corresponding output values are successively output. In an exemplary implementation, the FIR filter is employed within a digital cellular telephone for use in smoothing a digital signal to be transmitted. The size of the required FIR filter table is minimized by exploiting constraints imposed upon the signal to be filtered and by exploiting linearity and symmetry within the filter itself. More specifically, the telephone employs a data burst randomizer to provide a data signal composed of sequences of null or 0 values and sequences of antipodal values (+1's and -1's). Hence, the permissible input combinations for the FIR filter include only patterns containing either all antipodal signals, all null signals, leading antipodal signals followed by trailing null signals, or leading null signals followed by trailing antipodal signals.

In an exemplary implementation, the FIR filter is employed within a digital cellular telephone for use in smoothing a digital signal to be transmitted. The size of the required FIR filter table is minimized by exploiting constraints imposed upon the signal to be filtered and by exploiting linearity and symmetry within the filter itself. More specifically, the telephone employs a data burst randomizer to provide a data signal composed of sequences of null or 0 values and sequences of antipodal values (+1's and -1's). Hence, the permissible input combinations for the FIR filter include only patterns containing either all antipodal signals, all null signals, leading antipodal signals followed by trailing null signals, or leading null signals followed by trailing antipodal signals.

To reduce timing jitter, the SINR of a signal instance may be estimated for a number of different time offsets. The loop filter for the DLL is initially updated in the normal manner. If a change in the time offset used for the sample timing is detected, then the SINRs for the new and prior offsets are compared. The new time offset is used if the associated SINR is better. Otherwise, the prior time offset is retained and used.",QUALCOMM INC,BLACK PETER J;;SINDHUSHAYANA NAGABHUSHANA T,,https://lens.org/177-633-348-526-011,Granted Patent,no,6,0,31,31,0,H03L7/089;;H03L7/091;;H03L7/093;;H04B7/082;;H03L7/089;;H03L7/091;;H03L7/093;;H04B7/082;;H04B7/082;;H03L7/089;;H03L7/093;;H03L7/091,H04B1/707;;H03L7/089;;H03L7/091;;H03L7/093;;H04B7/08,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Orthogonal rate-dependent Walsh codes are used to cover repeated code symbols prior to transmission over a communication link. In one embodiment, the Walsh codes comprise orthogonal binary codes that increase by powers of two for each data rate used in the system. Code symbols are repeated and then covered at the symbol rate using the inventive orthogonal Walsh codes. The inventive code symbol repetition and encoding method and apparatus is particularly advantageous in encoding data that contains long sequences of logical zeros and ones. The orthogonal nature of the code symbols encoded in accordance with the present invention allows use of a more accurate and less complex data rate determination apparatus in the receiver. Rate determination is thereby improved resulting in an improvement in data service capability and a reduction in decoding errors. In one embodiment, symbol error rate (SER) blocks are used to generate rate-dependent SER metrics for each of the candidate rates. SER estimators associated with soft combiners using incorrect data rate hypotheses produce high symbol error rates with respect to the symbol error rate produced by the SER estimator associated with the soft combiner using the correct rate hypothesis. In another embodiment of the data rate determination and decoding method and apparatus of the present invention, energy metric calculators are used to generate rate-dependent re-encoded energy metrics for each candidate data rate.

The FIR filter table stores a pre-calculated output filter value for each permissible combination of input values to be filtered. Streams of input values are successively shifted into the table and corresponding output values are successively output. In an exemplary implementation, the FIR filter is employed within a digital cellular telephone for use in smoothing a digital signal to be transmitted. The size of the required FIR filter table is minimized by exploiting constraints imposed upon the signal to be filtered and by exploiting linearity and symmetry within the filter itself. More specifically, the telephone employs a data burst randomizer to provide a data signal composed of sequences of null or 0 values and sequences of antipodal values (+1's and -1's). Hence, the permissible input combinations for the FIR filter include only patterns containing either all antipodal signals, all null signals, leading antipodal signals followed by trailing null signals, or leading null signals followed by trailing antipodal signals. The FIR filter look up is configured to exploit these limitations on the input streams yielding a look up table having relatively few entries.

A receiving station estimates metric of a received slot, determines a quality metric threshold, and delimits an interval in accordance with the modified quality metric threshold. If the estimated quality metric is outside of the interval, the segment is decoded. The decoding process comprises delimiting a plurality of intervals in accordance with the quality metric threshold, associating each of the plurality of intervals with one of a plurality of parameters, determining an interval form the plurality of intervals into which the estimated quality metric belongs; and decoding the received signal for a number of iterations equal to the one of a plurality of parameters associated with the determined interval.

Code symbols are repeated and then covered at the symbol rate using the inventive orthogonal Walsh codes. The symbol error rate (SER) blocks are used to generate rate-dependent SER metrics for each of the candidate rates.

In a preferred implementation the automatic gain control apparatus may be adjusted to provide a desired control response to various fading characteristics of a received FM, FSK, GMSK, QPSK, or BPSK signal. The AGC apparatus includes an adjustable gain amplifier having an input port for receiving an input signal, a control port for receiving a gain control signal, and an output port for providing an output signal. A quadrature downconverter coupled to the output port serves to translate the frequency of the output signal to a baseband frequency, thereby producing baseband signals. In a preferred implementation the downconverter is operative to map the carrier frequency of the output signal to a baseband frequency offset by a predetermined margin from D.C. Two high gain active lowpass filters provide out-of-band signal rejection for the baseband signals. A D.C. feedthrough suppression loop, disposed to receive said baseband signal, suppresses D.C. offsets produced by the downconverter and lowpass filters, hence providing a compensated baseband signal. The AGC apparatus is further disposed to generate a received power signal based on the power of the output signal. A saturating integrator compares the received power signal to a reference signal and produces the gain control signal by integrating or by refraining from integration based on values of the reference, received power signal, and gain control signals, thereby extending the usable dynamic range of the receiver for FM mode.",QUALCOMM INC,WILSON NATHANIEL;;BLACK PETER;;PETERZELL PAUL,,https://lens.org/009-453-745-667-31X,Granted Patent,no,0,2,31,32,0,H03D3/002;;H03D3/008;;H03D7/165;;H03D2200/0025;;H03D2200/0047;;H03D2200/005;;H03D2200/0052;;H03G3/3052;;H03G3/3089;;H03G3/30;;H03D7/165;;H03G3/3052;;H03D2200/0052;;H03D2200/0047;;H03G3/3089;;H03D2200/0025;;H03D2200/005;;H03D3/008;;H03D3/002,H03G3/20;;H03D3/00;;H03D3/24;;H03D7/16;;H03G3/30;;H04B1/30;;H04L27/14;;H04L27/22,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A receiving station estimates metric of a received slot, determines a quality metric threshold, and delimits an interval in accordance with the modified quality metric threshold. If the estimated quality metric is outside of the interval, the segment is decoded. The decoding process comprises delimiting a plurality of intervals in accordance with the quality metric threshold, associating each of the plurality of intervals with one of a plurality of parameters, determining an interval form the plurality of intervals into which the estimated quality metric belongs; and decoding the received signal for a number of iterations equal to the one of a plurality of parameters associated with the determined interval.

The FIR filter table stores a pre-calculated output filter value for each permissible combination of input values to be filtered. Streams of input values are successively shifted into the table and corresponding output values are successively output. In an exemplary implementation, the FIR filter is employed within a digital cellular telephone for use in smoothing a digital signal to be transmitted. The size of the required FIR filter table is minimized by exploiting constraints imposed upon the signal to be filtered and by exploiting linearity and symmetry within the filter itself. More specifically, the telephone employs a data burst randomizer to provide a data signal composed of sequences of null or 0 values and sequences of antipodal values (+1's and -1's). Hence, the permissible input combinations for the FIR filter include only patterns containing either all antipodal signals, all null signals, leading antipodal signals followed by trailing null signals, or leading null signals followed by trailing antipodal signals. The FIR filter look up is configured to exploit these limitations on the input streams yielding a look up table having relatively few entries.

In a preferred implementation the automatic gain control apparatus may be adjusted to provide a desired control response to various fading characteristics of a received FM, FSK, GMSK, QPSK, or BPSK signal. The AGC apparatus includes an adjustable gain amplifier having an input port for receiving an input signal, a control port for receiving a gain control signal, and an output port for providing an output signal. A quadrature downconverter coupled to the output port serves to translate the frequency of the output signal to a baseband frequency, thereby producing baseband signals. In a preferred implementation the downconverter is operative to map the carrier frequency of the output signal to a baseband frequency offset by a predetermined margin from D.C. Two high gain active lowpass filters provide out-of-band signal rejection for the baseband signals. A D.C. feedthrough suppression loop, disposed to receive said baseband signal, suppresses D.C. offsets produced by the downconverter and lowpass filters, hence providing a compensated baseband signal. The AGC apparatus is further disposed to generate a received power signal based on the power of the output signal. A saturating integrator compares the received power signal to a reference signal and produces the gain control signal by integrating or by refraining from integration based on values of the reference, received power signal, and gain control signals, thereby extending the usable dynamic range of the receiver for FM mode.",QUALCOMM INC,WILSON NATHANIEL;;BLACK PETER;;PETERZELL PAUL,,https://lens.org/040-670-746-464-906,Granted Patent,no,0,0,31,32,0,H03D3/002;;H03D3/008;;H03D7/165;;H03D2200/0025;;H03D2200/0047;;H03D2200/005;;H03D2200/0052;;H03G3/3052;;H03G3/3089;;H03G3/30;;H03D7/165;;H03G3/3052;;H03D2200/0052;;H03D2200/0047;;H03G3/3089;;H03D2200/0025;;H03D2200/005;;H03D3/008;;H03D3/002,H03G3/20;;H03D3/00;;H03D3/24;;H03D7/16;;H03G3/30;;H04B1/30;;H04L27/14;;H04L27/22,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The circuit elements can be located directly in, or operatively coupled to, the transmit signal path. A phase rotation corresponding to an operating state defined by the received control signal(s) is then determined, and the phase of the modulated signal is rotated by an amount related to the determined phase rotation.

The FIR filter table stores a pre-calculated output filter value for each permissible combination of input values to be filtered. Streams of input values are successively shifted into the table and corresponding output values are successively output. In an exemplary implementation, the FIR filter is employed within a digital cellular telephone for use in smoothing a digital signal to be transmitted. The size of the required FIR filter table is minimized by exploiting constraints imposed upon the signal to be filtered and by exploiting linearity and symmetry within the filter itself. More specifically, the telephone employs a data burst randomizer to provide a data signal composed of sequences of null or 0 values and sequences of antipodal values (+1's and -1's). Hence, the permissible input combinations for the FIR filter include only patterns containing either all antipodal signals, all null signals, leading antipodal signals followed by trailing null signals, or leading null signals followed by trailing antipodal signals. The FIR filter look up is configured to exploit these limitations on the input streams yielding a look up table having relatively few entries.

In an exemplary implementation, the FIR filter is employed within a digital cellular telephone for use in smoothing a digital signal to be transmitted. The size of the required FIR filter table is minimized by exploiting constraints imposed upon the signal to be filtered and by exploiting linearity and symmetry within the filter itself. More specifically, the telephone employs a data burst randomizer to provide a data signal composed of sequences of null or 0 values and sequences of antipodal values (+1's and -1's). Hence, the permissible input combinations for the FIR filter include only patterns containing either all antipodal signals, all null signals, leading antipodal signals followed by trailing null signals, or leading null signals followed by trailing antipodal signals.

   A method and an apparatus for waveform quality measurement are disclosed. An actual signal, representing a waveform channelized both in time and in code is generated by, e.g., an exemplary HDR communication system. Test equipment generates an ideal waveform corresponding to the actual waveform. The test equipment then generates an estimate of offsets between parameters of the actual waveform and the ideal waveform, and the offsets are used to compensate the actual waveform. The test equipment then evaluates various waveform quality measurements utilizing the compensated actual waveform and the corresponding ideal waveform. Definitions of the various waveform quality measurements as well as conceptual and practical examples of processing of the actual waveform and the corresponding ideal waveform by the test equipment are disclosed. The disclosed method and apparatus may be extended to any waveform channelized both in time and in code regardless of the equipment that generated the waveform.

   A method and apparatus that determines how much power to allocate to each of a plurality of reverse link power control (RLPC) Channels to be transmitted from a base station, based upon data rate control (DRC) messages transmitted to the base station. Historical information is used to determine the quality of the Forward Link over which the RLPC is to be transmitted. If the history of the DRCs received indicates that the remote station to which the RLPC Channel is to be directed has not transmitted a DRC recently, then the base station allocates power to the RLPC Channels based upon information provided to the base station in DRCs that were received by the base station, but that were directed to other base stations. Accordingly, the base station can allocate power among the RLPC Channels without having received explicit information as to the quality of the Forward Link between the base station and every remote station intended to receive the information on the RLPC Channels.

In one aspect, an access point determines the set of spreading codes that will be used for the downlink and informs the associated access terminal (block 1402). An access point may also send information to the access terminal that identifies the spreading codes that are not being used by the access point and/or that identifies the spreading codes that are being used by some other access point (e.g., a neighbouring access point) (block 1408). The access terminal may then utilize the information received regarding the used spreading codes as well as the information regarding the spreading codes not used by the access point to more efficiently decode the received information (blocks 1410 and 1412).

Historical information is used to determine the quality of the Forward Link over which the RLPC is to be transmitted. If the history of the DRCs received indicates that the remote station to which the RLPC Channel is to be directed has not transmitted a DRC recently, then the base station allocates power to the RLPC Channels based upon information provided to the base station in DRCs that were received by the base station, but that were directed to other base stations. Accordingly, the base station can allocate power among the RLPC Channels without having received explicit information as to the quality of the Forward Link between the base station and every remote station intended to receive the information on the RLPC Channels.",QUALCOMM INC,ESTEVES EDUARDO A S;;BLACK PETER J,QUALCOMM INCORPORATED (2003-01-15),https://lens.org/077-358-265-292-214,Patent Application,yes,0,0,18,18,0,H04W52/225;;H04W52/226;;H04W52/228;;H04W52/265;;H04W52/267;;H04W52/32;;H04W52/343;;H04W52/346;;H04W52/50;;H04W52/04;;H04W52/265;;H04W52/32;;H04W52/346;;H04W52/50;;H04W52/226;;H04W52/228;;H04W52/343;;H04W52/225;;H04W52/267,H04B7/005;;H04B7/26;;H04W52/22;;H04W52/26;;H04W52/32;;H04W52/34;;H04W52/50,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A method and apparatus that determines how much power to allocate to each of a plurality of reverse link power control (RLPC) Channels to be transmitted from a base station, based upon data rate control (DRC) messages transmitted to the base station. Historical information is used to determine the quality of the Forward Link over which the RLPC is to be transmitted. If the history of the DRCs received indicates that the remote station to which the RLPC Channel is to be directed has not transmitted a DRC recently, then the base station allocates power to the RLPC Channels based upon information provided to the base station in DRCs that were received by the base station, but that were directed to other base stations. Accordingly, the base station can allocate power among the RLPC Channels without having received explicit information as to the quality of the Forward Link between the base station and every remote station intended to receive the information on the RLPC Channels.

Time reference for the return link is skewed or time-lagged relative to the time reference for the forward link to reduce the amount of guard time required to separate return link transmission from forward link reception by the half-duplex transceiver of a user terminal. The guard time is determined based on a maximum differential round-trip propagation delay and transition times of the half-duplexer transceiver to switch between transmit and receive modes. In a satellite communication system in which a large number of active user terminals are present in a beam coverage, random time offsets are applied to spread approximately equal traffic loads across the time offsets.

An access node may autonomously adjust its transmit power based on channel measurement and a defined coverage hole to mitigate interference. Transmit power may be defined based on channel quality.
