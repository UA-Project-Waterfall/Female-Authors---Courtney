   The invention is directed to presenting multimedia information materials from a database, preferably as a video broadcast. The invention includes storing a plurality of information segments in the database, providing an option to review the content of at least part of an information segment, selecting information segments from the database, and allowing a user to organize a subset of the selected information segments to affect a presentation of those information segments. The selected information segments may be loaded into a memory, including memory associated with a personal computer, a set-top box, or a personal video recorder. The selected information segments may also be represented using indicators, and the subset of selected information segments may be organized in a selected order where the indicators correspond to the subset. The subset of selected information segments may be presented in the same order as the corresponding indicators. The indicators may be stored in a buffer, such as a virtual shopping cart. The presentation may include playing, pausing, rewinding, and fast forwarding the corresponding information segments. The information segments in the database can include video clips, and can contain visual, audio, and/or text information. The presentation may include skipping forward or backward at least one video clip. The presentation may be realized on a computer, a media player, or a television, the latter of which may interface with a set-top box and/or a personal video recorder.

NATIONAL RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. June 11, 1963 [April 16, 1962], No. 14658/62. Heading H3B. In a laser the active material comprises an organic glass and one or more conjugated organic molecular species and is substantially spherical in shape. As shown in Fig. 1, the laser active element 11 is immersed in liquid nitrogen 12 in a quartz dewar flask 13 and is pumped by light from a krypton flash tube 14 the wavelength of which is controlled by filter 18. Since the active material is spherically shaped the stimulated radiation that escapes does so tangentially and the active material appears with a bright rim of illumination. Due to the spherical shape of the active medium the "" whispering gallery "" modes of the stimulated emissions are stored within the medium so that the laser operates for longer periods than normal. The elements may be formed by mixing the organic glass and the one or more conjugated organic species and then decanting drops of the mixture into a refrigerating fluid such as liquid nitrogen, the mixture on solidifying forming spherical droplets due to surface tension. If the organic glass is dextrose the formation of the spherical elements may take place at room temperatures by allowing drops of fused dextrose containing the desired conjugated organic species to fall into water, propanediol or other viscous liquid. By varying the temperature of the fused dextrose the shape of the drop can be varied, e.g. a drop with a long tail can be obtained, Fig. 2 (not shown) and the light energy may be extracted as a narrow and intense beam. Other substances which form organic glasses at room temperature are amorphous plastics and neat benzophenone. In the embodiment of Fig. 3 (not shown) light may be extracted from the whispering gallery modes at a selected time after they have been initiated by using a light guide of substantially the same refractive index as the material of the laser element and moving the guide into contact with the element when required. The laser element may be in the form of a hollow shell, Fig. 4 (not shown), where a shell 27 of glass or quartz is lined with a thin layer 28 of laser material. At the centre of the shell is exciting light source 29 and energy is extracted from the system via a light guide. The lasing material may be positioned on the exterior of the shell. The organic glass may comprise a mixture of ether isopentane and alcohol, methylcyclohexane and isopentane, ether or dextrose. Suitable conjugated organic species are napththalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrene, diphenyl triphenylene, acetophenone, benzaldehyde, benzoin, benzophenone, diphenylamine, eosin, fluorescein, α-napththol, #-naphthol, propiophenone or salicyclic aldehyde.",NAT RES DEV,MORANTZ DANIEL JOSEPH;;WRIGHT ANTHONY JOHN CALLAHAN;;WHITE BRIAN GRAHAM,,https://lens.org/174-893-452-502-601,Granted Patent,no,0,5,1,1,0,H01S3/0602;;H01S3/042;;H01S3/093;;H01S3/168,H01S3/042;;H01S3/06;;H01S3/093;;H01S3/16,H1C CH            CH;;H1C C201          -;;H1C C206          -;;H1C C207          -;;H1C C208          -;;H1C C21X          -;;H1C C211          -;;H1C C235          -;;H1C C24Y          -;;H1C C25Y          -;;H1C C26Y          -;;H1C C27Y          -;;H1C C30X          -;;H1C C311          -;;H1C C312          -;;H1C C313          -;;H1C C315          -;;H1C C316          -;;H1C C319          -;;H1C C320          -;;H1C C321          -;;H1C C322          -;;H1C C323          -;;H1C C324          -;;H1C C325          -;;H1C C326          -;;H1C C328          -;;H1C C332          -;;H1C C333          -;;H1C C35X          -;;H1C C35Y          -;;H1C C360          -;;H1C C364          -;;H1C C374          -;;H1C C384          -;;H1C C39Y          -;;H1C C392          -;;H1C C394          -;;H1C C403          -;;H1C C408          -;;H1C C48Y          -;;H1C C480          -;;H1C C481          -;;H1C C482          -;;H1C C490          -;;H1C C498          -;;H1C C499          -;;H1C C500          -;;H1C C501          -;;H1C C509          -;;H1C C519          -;;H1C C52Y          -;;H1C C521          -;;H1C C523          -;;H1C C526          -;;H1C C527          -;;H1C C529          -;;H1C C532          -;;H1C C536          -;;H1C C61Y          -;;H1C C62X          -;;H1C C629          -;;H1C C63X          -;;H1C C637          -;;H1C C638          -;;H1C C641          -;;H1C C660          -;;H1C C663          -;;H1C C665          -;;H1C C675          -;;H1C C710          -;;H1C C712          -;;H1C C72Y          -;;H1C C722          -;;H1C C724          -;;H1C C73Y          -;;H1C C750          -;;H1C C751          -;;H1C C752          -;;H1C C764          -;;H1C C77Y          -;;H1C C775          -;;H1C C777          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Construction. The laser cell 11, Fig. 1A, is formed of optical quartz to which is welded a filling tube 12. The cell end faces are provided with a partially-reflecting external coating 13 of silver and aluminium which is protected by a thin quartz layer 14. Alternatively, the coating 13 and quartz layer 14 may be internal, Fig. 1B. The cell is filled with the liquid laser material at room temperature to a level about half way up the tube 12 which is then sealed. The cell is then cooled to a temperature in the range 77 DEG to 90 DEG K, for example, by immersion in liquid nitrogen 17, Fig. 2, contained in a quartz Dewar vessel 16. Laser pumping is effected by a krypton discharge tube 18 provided with a partial reflecting coating 19, the tube being energized from a pulse power pack 21. The wavelength of the pumping light is <PICT:0983874/C4-C5/1> selected by means of a monochromator and/or filter 28. Stimulated emission is enhanced in the direction A by the semi-reflecting surface 13 and is observed externally by a photomultiplier 22. Phosphorescent radiation is observed by a photomultiplier 23 positioned at right angles to the optical axis A. Recording of both emissions is effected in an oscilloscope 25 which is fed from the photomultipliers through respective amplifiers 26, 27. Laser materials. The glass formed by supercooling may consist of a 10-3 molar concentration of benzophenone (AR grade) in a mixture of methyl cyclohexane and isopentane within the range 3 : 1 and 1 : 2. The solvents are purified by passage through a silica gel column. Alternatively, the liquid constituents of the glass may consist of acetophenone, benzaldehyde (AR grade), pyrazine or alphabromonaphthalene or a mixture of naphthalene (micro analytical grade) and benzophenone in a mixture of methyl cyclohexane and isopentane. Amongst other examples of suitable materials given are sulphuric acid or phosphoric acid as an inorganic glass and organic complexes such as phthalo-cyanines, chlorophylls, carotenoids, rare earth chelates, and alkali metal and transition metal complexes. Examples of substances suitable for the formation of an organic glass are mixtures of diethyl ether, isopentane and ethyl alcohol, propyl ether and isopentane, and bi-acetyl pyrazine, bromonaphthalene, benzoin, sodium anthracene and sodium benzophenone.",NAT RES DEV,MORANTZ DANIEL JOSEPH;;WRIGHT ANTHONY JOHN CALLAHAN;;WHITE BRIAN GRAHAM,,https://lens.org/175-088-926-608-905,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H01S3/17;;H01S3/042;;H01S3/093,H01S3/05;;H01S3/093;;H01S3/17;;H01S5/024,C2R RS311         -;;C3S S311          -;;C3S S33Y          -;;C3S S43Y          -;;C3S S650          -;;C3S S711          -;;C3S S715          -;;C3S S716          -;;C3S S735          -;;C3S S74Y          -;;C3S S75Y          -;;C3S S76Y          -;;C3S S78Y          -;;C4S S311          -;;C4S S33Y          -;;C4S S43Y          -;;C4S S650          -;;C4S S711          -;;C4S S715          -;;C4S S716          -;;C4S S735          -;;C4S S74Y          -;;C4S S75Y          -;;C4S S76Y          -;;C4S S78Y          -;;H1C CH            CH;;H1C C201          -;;H1C C208          -;;H1C C21X          -;;H1C C211          -;;H1C C212          -;;H1C C215          -;;H1C C216          -;;H1C C22X          -;;H1C C25Y          -;;H1C C26Y          -;;H1C C28Y          -;;H1C C311          -;;H1C C312          -;;H1C C313          -;;H1C C314          -;;H1C C315          -;;H1C C316          -;;H1C C317          -;;H1C C319          -;;H1C C321          -;;H1C C322          -;;H1C C323          -;;H1C C324          -;;H1C C325          -;;H1C C331          -;;H1C C332          -;;H1C C333          -;;H1C C334          -;;H1C C335          -;;H1C C35X          -;;H1C C35Y          -;;H1C C36Y          -;;H1C C360          -;;H1C C366          -;;H1C C39Y          -;;H1C C391          -;;H1C C392          -;;H1C C393          -;;H1C C394          -;;H1C C395          -;;H1C C451          -;;H1C C453          -;;H1C C48Y          -;;H1C C480          -;;H1C C482          -;;H1C C490          -;;H1C C498          -;;H1C C500          -;;H1C C502          -;;H1C C508          -;;H1C C509          -;;H1C C51Y          -;;H1C C513          -;;H1C C514          -;;H1C C519          -;;H1C C52Y          -;;H1C C521          -;;H1C C523          -;;H1C C530          -;;H1C C532          -;;H1C C534          -;;H1C C569          -;;H1C C63Y          -;;H1C C631          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The suction throttle valve includes a housing with a cavity formed therein. A first piston reciprocatingly disposed in the cavity is configured to cause a variable restriction of a flow of refrigerant through a suction inlet formed in the housing. The suction inlet provides fluid communication between a suction port and the cavity formed in the housing. The refrigerant flows through the suction port in a direction that is not parallel to a direction in which the piston reciprocates within the cavity. The suction throttle valve is configured to increase the restriction in the suction inlet when a crankcase pressure associated with the variable displacement compression is increased relative to an external suction pressure of the refrigerant entering the suction throttle valve.,HALLA VISTEON CLIMATE CONTROL,BRIAN KELM;;PETE GANSTER;;MICHAEL THEODORE;;RODNEY CALLAHAN;;JOHN MIKKELSEN,,https://lens.org/071-769-673-023-054,Patent Application,no,2,0,8,8,0,F16K15/025;;F16K17/0413;;F16K17/082;;F04B27/1804;;F04B2027/1868;;F04B2027/1881;;Y10T137/7838;;Y10T137/7925;;Y10T137/86879;;Y10T137/7764;;F16K11/105;;F04B27/08;;F04B27/14;;F16K15/025;;Y10T137/7838;;Y10T137/7925;;Y10T137/86879;;Y10T137/7764;;F16K15/025;;F16K17/0413;;F16K17/082;;F04B27/1804;;F04B2027/1868;;F04B2027/1881;;F16K11/105;;F16K15/063;;F16K15/066,F04B39/10;;F25B1/00,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

   A method and system that prepares a task for being swapped out from processor utilization that is executing on a computer with multiple processors that each support multiple streams. The task has one or more teams of threads, where each team represents threads executing on a single processor. The task designates, for each stream that is executing a thread, one stream as a team master stream and one stream as a task master stream. For each team master stream, the task notifies the operating system that the team is ready to be swapped out when each other thread of the team has saved its state and has quit its stream. Finally, for the task master stream, the task notifies the operating system that the task is ready to be swapped when it has saved its state and each other team has notified that it is ready to be swapped out.

   A method and system that prepares a task for being swapped out from processor utilization that is executing on a computer with multiple processors that each support multiple streams. The task has one or more teams of threads, where each team represents threads executing on a single processor. The task designates, for each stream that is executing a thread, one stream as a team master stream and one stream as a task master stream. For each team master stream, the task notifies the operating system that the team is ready to be swapped out when each other thread of the team has saved its state and has quit its stream. Finally, for the task master stream, the task notifies the operating system that the task is ready to be swapped when it has saved its state and each other team has notified that it is ready to be swapped out.
