   The life of a stepper is prolonged, while achieving a design L/S by changing the L/S values of a reticle with respect to the design L/S to facilitate printing. Etch bias is then conducted to vary etching so that the resulting L/S corresponds to the design L/S. In this way, the load on the stepper mechanism which moves the wafters about with respect to the optics in which the reticle is mounted is reduced.

    A method is provided herein for trim etching a resist line in a plasma etch apparatus. The method provides a reduced rate of vertical direction etching of the resist, and an increased rate of horizontal direction etching of the resist, by applying a lower biasing power to the plasma etch apparatus that is conventionally used. The resulting resist has an increased height in relation to its width which adds to the structural integrity of the resist line and significantly reduces problems of discontinuity in the resist line.

Generally, the present invention includes a step of forming a base metal structure on a semiconductor substrate. The base metal structure has a first predetermined length defined by sidewalls on ends of the first predetermined length of the base metal structure. The present invention also includes the step of depositing a layer of silicon on the sidewalls of the base metal structure, and this layer of silicon has a predetermined thickness. The layer of silicon reacts with the base metal structure at the sidewalls of the base metal structure in a silicidation anneal to form metal silicide comprised of the layer of silicon that has reacted with the base metal structure at the sidewalls of the base metal structure. The base metal structure has a second predetermined length that is reduced from the first predetermined length when the layer of silicon has consumed into the sidewalls of the base metal structure after the silicidation anneal. The second predetermined length depends on the predetermined thickness of the layer of silicon deposited on the sidewalls of the base metal structure before the silicidation anneal. After the silicidation anneal, the metal silicide is then removed from the sidewalls of the base metal structure. A remaining portion of the base metal structure, after the metal silicide is removed, forms the metal structure of the present invention having the reduced length that is substantially equal to the second predetermined length. The present invention may be used to particular advantage when the metal structure having the reduced length forms a gate electrode of a MOSFET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor).",ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,XIANG QI;;BELL SCOTT A;;YANG CHIH-YUH,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC (1999-05-05),https://lens.org/058-754-453-868-888,Granted Patent,yes,2,9,1,1,0,H01L21/28079;;H01L21/28123;;H01L21/321;;H01L29/66575;;Y10S438/947;;H01L21/28123;;H01L21/321;;H01L21/28079;;H01L29/66575;;Y10S438/947,H01L21/28;;H01L21/321;;H01L21/336,438/585;;438/197;;X438DIG  947,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The present invention also includes a step of depositing a layer of metal on the sidewalls of the masking polysilicon structure. The layer of metal has a predetermined thickness. The layer of metal reacts with the masking polysilicon structure at the sidewalls of the masking polysilicon structure in a silicidation anneal to form metal silicide. The masking polysilicon structure has a second predetermined length that is reduced from the first predetermined length when the metal silicide has consumed into the sidewalls of the masking polysilicon structure after the silicidation anneal. The second predetermined length depends on the predetermined thickness of the layer of metal deposited on the sidewalls of the masking polysilicon structure. The masking polysilicon structure has the second predetermined length and is used as a mask for etching a first layer of polysilicon to form the polysilicon structure from the first layer of polysilicon. The remaining polysilicon structure after this etch has the reduced length that is substantially equal to the second predetermined length of the masking polysilicon structure.

    The present invention relates to a system and a method for reducing the linewidth of ultra thin resist features. The present invention accomplishes this end by applying a densification process to an ultra thin resist having a thickness of less than about 2500 formed over a semiconductor structure. In one aspect of the present invention, the method includes providing a semiconductor substrate having a device film layer formed thereon. An ultra thin resist is then deposited over the device film layer. The ultra thin resist is patterned according to a desired structure or feature using conventional photolithography techniques. Following development, the ultra thin resist is implanted with a dopant. After the implantation is substantially completed, the device film layer is anisotropically etched.

The increased density of the layer increases its resistance to polysilicon etch chemistry, thus reducing the likelihood of patterning inaccuracies resulting from amorphous carbon depletion during polysilicon etch, and enabling the patterning of thicker polysilicon layers than can be reliably patterned without densification. The increased density also reduces stresses, thus reducing the likelihood of delamination. Densification may be performed by UV or e-beam irradiation after formation of an overlying protective layer. Densification may also be performed by annealing the amorphous carbon layer in situ prior to formation of the overlying protective layer.

The stabilized pasta compositions are attained by the incorporation of nisin-containing cultured whey derived from a nisin-producing culture. The cooked pasta compositions of this invention, which include both filled and unfilled pasta compositions, are stable at refrigeration temperatures for 120 days or longer and require no further cooking (i.e., the pasta is fully hydrated and only requires warming before serving). The nisin-containing whey can be prepared by forming an aqueous composition comprising sweet whey from the fermentation of a cheese, whey protein concentrate, and a protein hydrolysate; fermenting the aqueous composition with a nisin-producing culture until the pH attains about 5.5; maintaining the pH of the fermenting composition at about 5.5 for 8-10 hrs; and allowing the pH of the fermenting composition to drop to 4.8 or lower. The nisin-containing cultured whey can also be prepared by a inoculating a pasteurized dairy composition with a culture of a nisin-producing microorganism, incubating the composition until the pH attains a value between about 6.2 and about 4.0 and a whey and curd mixture is formed, and separating the whey from the whey and curd mixture to give the separated whey which is the nisin-containing cultured whey. The pasta of the present invention is prepared from pasta dough comprising about 55 to about 80 percent high protein wheat flour, about 1 to about 5 percent wheat gluten, 0 to about 20 percent egg product, 0 to about 3 percent dough conditioner, sufficient nisin-containing cultured whey to provide about 200 to about 1200 IU nisin/g pasta dough, and sufficient water to provide a total moisture content of about 25 to about 35 percent.

   The present invention provides fully cooked, ready to heat and serve pasta compositions which are stabilized against the development of toxins from pathogenic bacterial contaminants under refrigeration conditions for 120 days or more. The stabilized pasta compositions are attained by the incorporation of nisin-containing cultured whey derived from a nisin-producing culture. The cooked pasta compositions of this invention, which include both filled and unfilled pasta compositions, are stable at refrigeration temperatures for 120 days or longer and require no further cooking (i.e., the pasta is fully hydrated and only requires warming before serving). The nisin-containing whey can be prepared by forming an aqueous composition comprising sweet whey from the fermentation of a cheese, whey protein concentrate, and a protein hydrolysate; fermenting the aqueous composition with a nisin-producing culture until the pH attains about 5.5; maintaining the pH of the fermenting composition at about 5.5 for 8-10 hrs; and allowing the pH of the fermenting composition to drop to 4.8 or lower. The nisin-containing cultured whey can also be prepared by a inoculating a pasteurized dairy composition with a culture of a nisin-producing microorganism, incubating the composition until the pH attains a value between about 6.2 and about 4.0 and a whey and curd mixture is formed, and separating the whey from the whey and curd mixture to give the separated whey which is the nisin-containing cultured whey. The pasta of the present invention is prepared from pasta dough comprising about 55 to about 80 percent high protein wheat flour, about 1 to about 5 percent wheat gluten, 0 to about 20 percent egg product, 0 to about 3 percent dough conditioner, sufficient nisin-containing cultured whey to provide about 200 to about 1200 IU nisin/g pasta dough, and sufficient water to provide a total moisture content of about 25 to about 35 percent. Sauces and/or fillings included with the pasta compositions are preferably prepared using the same or similar nisin-containing cultured whey compositions to provide increased stability.

The present invention provides a separate storage means that keeps track of gross winnings on individual plays of a slot machine that exceed a predetermined amount (jackpots), and permits the accumulating jackpot winnings to be used by the player for additional play of the slot machine. The amount of winnings in the jackpot meter is then used to determine the amount of winnings to be included on an IRS reporting form called a W2-G Form. The present invention avoids the time consuming and error prone system currently used and provides the player with a more enjoyable gaming experience, and at the same time provides the IRS with more accurate information.

    An exemplary method of using silicon containing imaging layers to define sub-resolution gate structures can include depositing an anti-reflective coating over a layer of polysilicon, depositing an imaging layer over the anti-reflective coating, selectively etching the anti-reflective coating to form a pattern, and removing portions of the polysilicon layer using the pattern formed from the removed portions of anti-reflective coating. Thus, the use of thin imaging layer, that has high etch selectivity to the organic underlayer, allows the use of trim etch techniques without a risk of resist erosion or aspect ratio pattern collapse. That, in turn, allows for the formation of the gate pattern with widths less than the widths of the pattern of the imaging layer.

Valve controlled means are operable to place the buret in communication with the pipette or a reservoir. In the first position of the pipette, a precise sample volume is aspirated into it by the buret, then driven by the oscillator and in its second position and with the buret drive reversed but still powered by the oscillator, the sample volume is discharged from the pipette into a cuvette in the fluorometer. On the resulting fluorescence the fluorometer output drives the pulse generator to dispense chelating agent and to operate a counter until a selected end point is reached. The pipette is then returned to its second position with the buret drive again operated by the oscillator and during the return, the buret is refilled. Both before the sample volume is aspirated, and before that volume is discharged, backlash is removed from the buret drive.

    A method of doubling the frequency of small pattern formation. The method includes forming a photoresist layer, and then patterning it. A RELACS polymer is spread over the patterned photoresist layer. Portions of the RELACS polymer on top portions of each patterned photoresist region are removed, by either etching or by polishing them off. Portions between each patterned photoresist region are also removed in this step. The patterned photoresist regions are removed, preferably by a flood exposure and then application of a developer to the exposed photoresist regions. The remaining RELACS polymer regions, which were disposed against respective sidewalls of the patterned photoresist regions, prior to their removal, are then used for forming small pattern regions to be used in a semiconductor device to be formed on the substrate. These small pattern regions can be used to form separate poly-gates.

    A bi-layer trim etch process to form integrated circuit gate structures can include depositing an organic underlayer over a layer of polysilicon, depositing an imaging layer over the organic underlayer, patterning the imaging layer, selectively trim etching the organic underlayer to form a pattern, and removing portions of the polysilicon layer using the pattern formed from the removed portions of organic underlayer. Thus, the use of thin imaging layer, that has high etch selectivity to the organic underlayer, allows the use of trim etch techniques without a risk of resist erosion or the aspect ratio pattern collapse. That, in turn, allows for the formation of the gate pattern with widths less than the widths of the pattern of the imaging layer.

    The present invention generally relates to a method of forming a graded junction within a semiconductor substrate. A first masking pattern having a first opening characterized by a first lateral dimension is formed over the semiconductor substrate. The semiconductor substrate is doped with a first dopant, using the first masking pattern as a doping mask, thereby forming a first dopant region in the semiconductor substrate underlying the first opening. The first masking pattern is swelled to decrease the first lateral dimension of the first opening to a second lateral dimension. The semiconductor substrate is then doped with a second dopant, using the swelled first masking pattern as a doping mask, thereby forming a second dopant region in the semiconductor substrate, and furthermore defining a graded junction within the semiconductor substrate.

The obtained data may be compared with reference data (e.g., historical data) to continuously update a confidence level associated with the user. Based on the confidence level, profile the user to detect any inconsistencies in the data collected over time. The system may further execute one or more competitive processes in parallel with traditional authentication processes to identify potentially unauthorized users.

    A method of forming a conductor pattern on a base with uneven topography includes placing conductor material on the base, placing a hard mask material on the conductor material, planarizing an exposed surface of the hard mask material, and placing a layer of resist on the hard mask material. The resist is patterned and the patterned resist is used in selectively etching the hard mask material, with the hard mask material used in selectively etching the underlying conductor material. By planarizing the hard mask material prior to placing a layer of resist thereupon, uniformity of the resist coating is enhanced and depth of focus problems in exposing the resist are reduced.

   A method of forming a shallow trench isolation is provided. In the method, a barrier oxide layer is formed on a substrate, and a silicon nitride layer is formed on the barrier oxide layer. A metal layer is formed on the silicon nitride layer, and an ultra-thin photoresist is formed on the metal layer. The ultra-thin photoresist layer is patterned with short wavelength radiation to define a pattern for a shallow trench. The ultra-thin photoresist layer is used as a mask during a first etch step to transfer the shallow trench pattern to the metal layer. The first etch step includes an etch chemistry that is selective to the metal layer over the ultra-thin photoresist layer. The metal layer is used as a hard mask during a second etch step to form the shallow trench by etching portions of the silicon nitride layer, barrier oxide layer and substrate.
