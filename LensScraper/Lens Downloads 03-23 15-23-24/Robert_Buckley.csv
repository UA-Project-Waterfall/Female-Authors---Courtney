THOMAS ROBINSON & SON Ltd., and R. H. BUCKLEY. 25 March, 1968 [17 March, 1967], No. 12632/67. Heading B8A. In a timber transfer device used, for example, between a longitudinally-fed moulder and a tenoning and boring machine, timber lengths 19 from the moulder (not shown) pass through a tiering device 20 and, after actuating switches 28, drop on to a driven rollerway 14, 15. The switches cause dogged chains 29 to move in a direction 34 so that a timber length, now at position 100, moves laterally out of the path of the next successive timber length, as well as longitudinally towards a fair-ending fence 25 having a gate section 38. In normal operation, each timber length, on abutting the fence 25, is carried by a multi-belt conveyer 44 to a pick-up station provided with switch-operating members 48. The pick-up station includes pick-up arms 58, 59, the arm 59 being adjustable along a shaft 51 according to the longitudinal dimensions of the timber lengths. For gripping the lengths one of a pair of grip plates 64 is movable axially by a ram 65. Upon arrival at the pick-up station a timber length actuates the associated switches 45, 48 the length is gripped and, by means of a ram 80 whose operation is initiated by a dogged-chain conveyer 49, the pick-up arms 58, 59 are rotated through 180 degrees and the timber length deposited on the conveyer 49. The pick-up arms then return, through 180 degrees to their original position. An adjustable lost motion cam 81 permits the timber length, during its transfer in the arms 58, 59, to be turned over as necessary, to ensure that any desired face thereof is uppermost. The conveyer 49 may feed a double-ended tenoning cut-off and boring machine (not shown). If there is a build up of timber lengths in front of the pick-up device, a series of switches 41, if simultaneously actuated by the lengths for a continuous period, cause the gate section 38 of the fence 25 to swing to its inoperative position and excess-lengths such as the length 50 are withdrawn by escape rollers 42, 43 to a receiver or a second transfer device. The illustrated device is supported on wheels 12 and rails 13 and may be locked in position.",THOMAS ROBINSON & SON LTD;;BUCKLEY ROBERT HOWARD,BUCKLEY ROBERT HOWARD,,https://lens.org/087-201-763-982-768,Granted Patent,no,0,5,1,1,0,B65G47/54;;B27M1/08,B27M1/08;;B65G47/54,B8A AGC           AGC;;B8A AP3           AGC;;B8A AR13          AGC;;B8A AT1           AGC;;B8A AT3           AGC;;B8A A1C4D1A       -;;B8A A1C4D1C1      -;;B8A A1C4L2B       -;;B8A A1C4M10       -;;B8A A1C4M11       -;;B8A A1C4M2        -;;B8A A1C4M3        -;;B8A A1C4M5        -;;B8A A1C4S1        -;;B8A A1C4S13       -;;B8A A1C4X10       -;;B8A A1F1          -;;B8A A1H12A        -;;B8A A1H17A        -;;B8A A4HB          A4HB;;B8A A4P2Y         -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    Conventionally, the rendering parameter options are set independently of a document. Each object is rendered independently. For documents having many independent objects, this requires significant computational resources and time. However, many documents have a predominant document type. For such documents, it is often sufficient to identify the document type. Then, predetermined rendering techniques are applied to the objects within that document based on the determined document type. Alternatively, a user may be interested in one type of object to the exclusion of the other types of objects. Accordingly, optimally rendering objects whose quality the user is indifferent to wastes resources. Document type based rendering systems, methods and graphical user interfaces define rendering parameter options for rendering the objects of a document based on an identified document type, irrespective of the object types of that document's objects. The document type based rendering systems, methods and graphical user interfaces optionally determine a document's predominant object and apply rendering parameter options to that document's objects based on the determined predominant object type. The document type based rendering systems, methods and graphical user interfaces permit document optimized rendering parameter options to be defined.

THOMAS ROBINSON & SON Ltd. 19 Feb., 1968 [9 March, 1967], No. 11025/67. Heading B3B. [Also in Division B5] A drilling, milling or like machine comprises a table 11 rotatable about a vertical axis, an actuator 60 which controls the machine, and indexing means comprising an arcuate member 47 extending around the table and coaxial therewith and having a plurality of adjustable stops 48 thereon, each stop being adapted when in register with the actuator to operate the latter to cause actuation of the machine, the actuator and arcuate member being connected to or provided are on the table and the other on a stationary part of the machine. As described, the machine is for sawing timber roof trusses and the table 11 is supported for rotation on a base 10 by rollers 13 engaging a flange 12 on the table. A diametal slot 14 is provided in the table for the passage of a circular saw blade 25 disposed within a tapered casing 15 connected by a spigot 16 at its lower end to a bearing 18 joined to a suction pipe. The blade is mounted on a shaft 24 supported by a sleeve 23 carried by arms 22 on a trunnion 21 rotatably mounted on an intermediate shaft 19 rotatably supported by brackets 20 from the table 11. Extensions 26 from the trunnion are connected to a ram 27, 28 whereby the blade is raised and lowered through the slot 14 while rotated by belts 32, 33 from a motor 31. A guard 35 is carried by vertically slidable posts 37 which are connected to levers 41 mounted on pivots 40 and operable by a ram 45 to lower the guard from an inoperative position to a position clamping the timber on to the table during a sawing operation. The arcuate member 47 is secured to the table by a number of brackets 46 and carries a plurality of stops 48 each of which is clampable in adjusted positions by a screw 50. Each stop has an extension 51 housing a spring- loaded plunger 55 having a head 54 which, when the plunger is depressed, can operate the button 61 of the actuator which is located in a depression 59 in a platform 57 secured to the base 10. Roller conveyers 64, 65 are disposed on opposite sides of the table 10 and are provided with adjustable fences 71a, 70b and clamps 71. Conveyer 62 also has a rotatable stop 75b carried by a bracket 74 which is adjustable along a rod 73 rotatable to permit the stop to be raised by an inoperative position. Stop 75b is aligned with the centre of the table and has a flat face 75c and is rotatable to accommodate angled cuts on the ends of the timbers. In operation a timber to be cut with angled ends is fed over conveyer 65 so that its leading end is on conveyer 64 and the timber is held by clamps 71. With a stop 48 adjusted to the desired angular position, the table 11 is rotated by the operator gripping and depressing the plunger 55 of the stop until it rides up a ramp 63 on the platform 57 and enters the depression 59 to engage button 61 of the actuator which operates ram 45 to lower the guard 35 and clamp the timber and operates ram 28 to raise the saw and cut the timber. After retraction of the saw and release of the timber, the timber is advanced until its leading cut end engages the stop surface 75c and the table is rotated if the other end of the timber is to be cut at a different angle, until the stop is above the actuator for cutting of the opposite end of the timber.",THOMAS ROBINSON & SON LTD,BUCKLEY ROBERT HOWARD,,https://lens.org/061-430-128-902-20X,Granted Patent,no,0,5,2,2,0,B23D45/068;;B23D47/04;;B23Q16/04;;Y10T409/308792;;Y10T409/30392;;Y10T409/309576;;Y10T409/307896;;Y10T83/7493;;Y10T83/606;;Y10T83/7701;;Y10T83/8773;;Y10T409/308792;;Y10T409/30392;;Y10T409/309576;;Y10T409/307896;;Y10T83/7493;;Y10T83/606;;Y10T83/7701;;Y10T83/8773;;B23D45/068;;B23Q16/04;;B23D47/04,B23D45/06;;B23D47/04;;B23Q16/04,B3B B13C1         -;;B3B B17AX         B17A;;B3B B43F1         B43K;;B3B B43K1         B43K;;B5L L2            -;;B5L L5E           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A method that finds all test vectors for all detectable single stuck-at faults in a combinational circuit during a single pass through the circuit sorts a netlist into circuit-level order, provides a library of fault-propagation and path-enabling rules for the circuit's logic elements, begins at the level of the primary inputs, and applies the rules, one logic element at a time, circuit-level-by-circuit-level until the entire circuit has been processed. The resulting fault-propagation functions for each output line define every combination of primary input signals that makes a fault detectable at that output line. In another embodiment, the method determines the highest circuit level at which each signal is used, and releases storage being used for previously computed fault-propagation functions and path-enabling functions for any signal having no further uses. The elimination of no longer needed stored information permits the method to handle larger circuits given finite resources.

SOLUTION: The feature (e.g. the generation of a keyboard or a scanner) concerning the production of a document is identified (26) and a spelling check rule is selected based on the identified feature (28). The selected rule identifies the substitute spelling based on the knowledge concerning the feature of production of the document and allocates the substitute candidates of a possible word (30). These candidates are displayed in the order of estimated accurate possibilities (32). When a user selects a proposed word as an actually intended word (34), the error character is stored as a part of a correction profile for the user of the document (36) and the rule selected in the step 28 is changed based on the profile feature that is identified and stored for the document.",XEROX CORP,BUCKLEY ROBERT R;;LUC VINCENT,,https://lens.org/077-580-953-670-175,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,G06F17/21;;G06F17/22;;G06F17/27;;G06F17/28,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

[Also in Division G1] An apparatus which arranges timber lengths 30 in fair-ended tiers or bundles on a table 12 comprises a pair of guide rollers 21, 14, either or both being driven, carried by a vertically adjustable carriage 18, and a stabilizing means, e.g. a roller 22, or a pressure pad, which is arranged adjacent the upper guide roller 21 and prevents timber lengths which are fed between the guide rollers tipping about the lower roller until the lengths have passed the stabilizing means. Also disposed adjacent the upper guide roller is a bell crank lever 23, 24 which, when a timber length is passing under it from the worktable of, e.g. a planing machine, activates a microswitch which is connected to an electrical counting device or a lineal footage meter. Displacement of the completed tiers or bundles is preferably actuated under the control of the electrical counter whereby each tier or bundle, when comprising a predetermined number of lengths or a predetermined footage, is displaced longitudinally or transversely of the table 12. The lineal footage meter may be a separate unit or mechanically interconnected with the lower roller 14. Alternatively it may be operated electrically through a series of electrical impulses obtained from a contactor on one of the rollers of the tiering device.",THOMAS ROBINSON & SON LTD;;ROBERT HOWARD BUCKLEY,BUCKLEY ROBERT HOWARD;;CLAYTON HENRY,,https://lens.org/183-102-371-051-792,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B65B19/34,B65B19/34,B8A A4JJ          A4JJ;;B8A A4K2A         A4JJ;;B8A A4X1          A4JJ;;B8C C10A          1T;;B8C C10B1B        1T;;B8C C10B1D1       1T;;B8C C10G          1T;;B8C C10L1A        1T;;B8C C10L2B        1T;;B8C C9            1T;;G1M MAAC          MAAC;;G1M M11A          MAAC;;G1M M12C          MAAC,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A method for selecting CMY coordinates for printing a desired source color represented in an source color-space includes the step of obtaining coordinates for the printer gamut in the source color-space and then dividing the printer gamut into a plurality of tetrahedra, one of which contains the desired source color. This particular tetrahedron, referred to as the source-bearing tetrahedron, is identified and transformed into a target-bearing tetrahedron in the CMY color space. The target-bearing tetrahedron contains the CMY coordinates of the desired color. The specific color within the target-bearing tetrahedron is identified by obtaining barycentric coordinates for the source color relative to the source-bearing tetrahedron and identifying that color in the target-bearing tetrahedron that has the same barycenric coordinates. The CMY coordinates for that color can then be provided to a printer to print the desired source color.

The circuit has four channels, one each for constant colors, continuous-tone images, image masks, and instructions. The constant colors are stored in the first channel in the form of two eight-bit colors, one for the text or line art and one for the background. Any color pair can be read from this memory, divided into two eight-bit colors, and presented at two inlets of a final multiplexer (28). The second channel stores continuous-tone color pictures and presents this information at a third inlet of the multiplexer (28). The third channel receives masks or outlines in the form of bitmaps, and the fourth channel receives instructions which may be run-length encoded. These two channels combine their data, which is then used to control the multiplexer (28).",XEROX CORP,BUCKLEY ROBERT R;;RUMPH DAVID E,,https://lens.org/148-545-014-090-842,Patent Application,yes,0,0,11,11,0,H04N1/46;;H04N1/46;;H04N1/3871;;H04N1/3871;;H04N1/3872;;H04N1/3872,B41J2/52;;H04N1/23;;H04N1/387;;H04N1/46,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Laser sources, located in a protected environment, transmit light through the boundary separating the protected environment from the unprotected one. The light is then split into a number of beams and fed to electro-optical modulators, where it is modulated in response to electrical signals received from the sensors. The modulated light signals are then wavelength-division multiplexed and transmitted back through the environment boundary, where they are amplified, demultiplexed and converted to electrical signals. Multiplexing reduces the number of boundary penetrations, and the use of highly stable electro-optical modulators eliminates the need for signal conditioning electronics at each sensor. This optical approach is particularly beneficial in an underwater application, such as a submarine receiving data from a large array of acoustic sensors, where it is desired that hull penetrations be minimized and the underwater components be highly reliable and stable.",HUGHES ELECTRONICS CORP,SONDEREGGER JAMES F;;BUCKLEY ROBERT H,HUGHES ELECTRONICS CORPORATION (1999-05-06),https://lens.org/162-869-129-253-769,Granted Patent,yes,14,26,2,2,0,G01D5/35383;;G01H9/00;;G01H9/004;;G01V1/201;;G10K11/008;;G01D5/35383;;G10K11/008;;G01H9/004;;G01H9/00;;G01V1/201,G01D5/353;;G01H9/00;;G01V1/20;;G10K11/00,359/168;;359/285;;367/157,2,0,,,"Optoelectronics and Lightwave Technology, John Wiley and Sons, Inc.

    Rather than implementing a printer as a single set of rendering parameters, a printer can be implemented as a meta-printer that comprises one or more virtual printers. The virtual printers define different sets of rendering parameters. Each virtual printer is accessed through a page description language or through a user interface presiding in a print driver or server. In particular, each virtual printer of the meta-printer has an associated set of rendering parameters. One virtual printer of this meta-printer may be set up to print a first type of content using a first set of selected rendering parameters. This same virtual printer may be set up to print a different type of content using a different set of selected rendering parameters. This may be repeated for any number of additional content types. A user can access these virtual printers to print a document containing a variety of different content types. A user may select one virtual printer of the meta-printer to render an entire document. In this case, if the selected virtual printer defines only a single selected rendering parameter option for each rendering parameter, that rendering parameter option will be used to render all of the different various content types in that document.

The circuit is particularly useful for field test environments where laboratory instrumentation is normally not available, and fast and accurate phase noise measurements are required. The phase noise measuring circuit includes a frequency mixer which has a first input signal from a device under test and a second input signal from a reference stable oscillator having ultra low phase noise with a fixed center frequency. The frequency mixer mixes the first and second input signals to produce a down converted signal comprising the frequency difference signal of the first and second input signals. A lowpass filter then passes the down converted signal to a frequency doubler circuit which produces a doubled frequency, down converted signal. A lowpass signal filter then passes the doubled frequency, down converted signal to an amplifier. The output of the amplifier is directed to a second frequency doubler circuit which produces a quadrupled frequency, down converted signal. That signal is then directed to a further lowpass filter which passes the quadrupled frequency, down converted signal to a further amplifier. Finally, a direct approach spectrum analyzer analyzes the amplifier output signal which is an intermediate frequency signal in the most sensitive range of the spectrum analyzer for phase noise measurements on the device under test.",HARRIS CORP,NAJLE ESTEBAN G;;BUCKLEY ROBERT M,BUCKLEY ROBERT M (1993-04-16);;ADVANCED TESTING TECHNOLOGIES INC (1993-10-12);;HARRIS CORPORATION (1991-06-17),https://lens.org/116-601-848-155-801,Granted Patent,yes,5,37,1,2,0,G01R29/26;;G01R29/26,G01R29/26,324/613;;324/622;;455/226.1,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    The command embedding systems and methods enable embedding control signals into standard video signals during recording. Specifically, a user selects a mode of operation of the command signal embedding system. Based on the selected mode, control signals are either manually or automatically embedded in a video signal as the video signal is recorded. The control signals may include, but are not limited to, commands that identify the state of the video camera or the environmental conditions surrounding the video camera or commands that tag key frames in the video signal. Once the control signal is received and embedded, the embedded control signal may be recorded, for example, to facilitate further editing, or may be directly televised or broadcast with further manipulation in mind.

In a normal position for forward motion, the device is biassed to a shortest length by a return spring 5 and is locked by a valve 8 which prevents oil flow, allowing operation of the overrun brake. When a towing vehicle engages a reverse gear, a hydraulic brake valve 8 allows oil transfer to port 7 to lengthen the device, thus preventing overrun braking. Disengaging the reverse gear allows the spring 5 to return the piston 3 and piston rod 2 to the normal position. Reverse gear may be detected from small reverse movement of a brake calliper acting on the valve 8 which may be mounted near the caliper (figs 2-5).

The circuit is particularly useful for field test environments where laboratory instrumentation is normally not available, and fast and accurate phase noise measurements are required. The phase noise measuring circuit includes a frequency mixer which has a first input signal from a device under test and a second input signal from a reference stable oscillator having ultra low phase noise with a fixed center frequency. The frequency mixer produces a down converted signal comprising the frequency difference signal of the first and second input signals. A lowpass filter passes the down converted signal to a frequency multiplier circuit which produces a second harmonic signal, a fourth harmonic signal, and higher harmonic signals of the down converted signal. A narrow bandpass filter passes a selected one of the second or higher harmonic signals to a low noise amplifier, the output of which is passed to a direct approach spectrum analyzer for measurement of the phase noise of the device under test.

Laser sources, located in a protected environment, transmit light through the boundary separating the protected environment from the unprotected one. The light is then split into a number of beams and fed to electro-optical modulators, where it is modulated in response to electrical signals received from the sensors. The modulated light signals are then wavelength-division multiplexed and transmitted back through the environment boundary, where they are amplified, demultiplexed and converted to electrical signals. Multiplexing reduces the number of boundary penetrations, and the use of highly stable electro-optical modulators eliminates the need for signal conditioning electronics at each sensor. This optical approach is particularly beneficial in an underwater application, such as a submarine receiving data from a large array of acoustic sensors, where it is desired that hull penetrations be minimized and the underwater components be highly reliable and stable.",HUGHES AIRCRAFT CO,SONDEREGGER JAMES F;;BUCKLEY ROBERT H,HUGHES ELECTRONICS CORPORATION (1997-12-17);;HUGHES ELECTRONICS (1996-03-13),https://lens.org/018-770-412-853-259,Granted Patent,yes,10,37,2,2,0,G01D5/35383;;G01H9/00;;G01H9/004;;G01V1/201;;G10K11/008;;G01D5/35383;;G10K11/008;;G01H9/004;;G01H9/00;;G01V1/201,G01D5/353;;G01H9/00;;G01V1/20;;G10K11/00,359/144;;359/133;;359/168;;359/141,2,0,,,"Optoelectronics and Lightwave Technology, John Wiley and Sons, Inc.

AÙrated beverages, raising and drawing - off. - The object of the invention is to draw - off measured quantities of aÙrated beverages from bulk without letting the gas escape from the bulk of the liquid ; flavouring syrups and essences for mixture therewith are also measured off. The aÙrated beverage, say soda water, is drawn from a stand-pipe a into a closed measure b through a lateral piston valve b<9>, when a vertical spindle b<1> in the centre of the measure is pressed down by a hand-lever c so that a collar b<6> thereon applies a bell crank b<7> to the valve. A valve b<8> hanging with play from a pin b<11> in the spindle closes the delivery neck at the bottom of the measure before the supply valve is opened. When the spindle is allowed to revert to its initial position, owing to the spring b<2>, the measure empties itself and the gas of the draught snifts through a hole b<15> in the stuffing-box of the spindle, the packing of which acts as a valve to the hole. The snifting gas passes a diaphragm valve in a chamber p at the top of the stand-pipe, and thereby operates a counter for registering the number of draughts delivered. Small quantities of flavouring-syrups or the like are raised by plungers c<2> in stand-pipes c<18>, and are delivered through bibs f<4> kinked to prevent dripping, for which purpose also the pipes have airchamber heads k. Any plunger can be operated by the one hand-lever c, as it is fulcrumed in a swivel c<7>, and is formed with lateral lugs to catch the heads of the plungers.",BRAKE ALFRED;;MCKEE ROBERT JAMES;;JOYCE BUCKLEY,BRAKE ALFRED;;MCKEE ROBERT JAMES;;JOYCE BUCKLEY,,https://lens.org/031-927-491-895-302,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The shape and relative dimensions of the various parts of the New Object match that of another 3D object (the “Target Object”). In addition, the exterior of the New Object appears to be a photographic likeness of the Target Object.

The approach works by slicing a 3D model, selectively printing a fluid onto a sheet of substrate material for each layer based on the model, flooding onto the substrate a powdered metal to which the fluid adheres in printed areas, clamping and aligning a stack of coated sheets, heating the stacked sheets to melt the powdered metal and fuse the layers of substrate, and removing excess powder and unfused substrate.",IMPOSSIBLE OBJECTS LLC,SWARTZ ROBERT;;BAYLDON JOHN;;CRIST BUCKLEY;;GORE EUGENE,IMPOSSIBLE OBJECTS INC (2015-12-04);;IMPOSSIBLE OBJECTS LLC (2017-09-15),https://lens.org/041-797-786-301-743,Patent Application,yes,3,5,16,16,0,C22C47/025;;C22C47/062;;C22C47/20;;C22C49/14;;B22F2998/10;;B22F2999/00;;B33Y30/00;;B33Y40/00;;B29C64/112;;B29C64/165;;B29C64/205;;B29C64/194;;B33Y10/00;;Y02P10/25;;B22F12/00;;B22F12/53;;B22F10/66;;B22F10/62;;B22F10/10;;B22F10/73;;B22F7/04;;C22C47/025;;C22C47/062;;C22C47/20;;C22C49/14;;B33Y80/00;;B22F10/10;;B33Y40/20;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y30/00;;B33Y70/10;;B22F2998/10;;B22F2999/00;;B22F12/53;;B22F10/62;;B22F10/73;;B22F10/20;;B22F10/31;;B22F10/66;;B22F2201/01;;Y02P10/25;;C22C47/025;;C22C47/062;;C22C47/20;;C22C49/14;;B22F2998/10;;B22F2999/00;;B33Y30/00;;B33Y40/00;;B29C64/112;;B29C64/194;;B29C64/205;;B29C64/165;;Y02P10/25;;B22F10/10;;B22F10/73;;B22F12/00;;B22F12/53;;B22F10/62;;B22F10/66;;B22F7/04;;B29C67/00;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y80/00;;B22F2007/045;;B22F3/02;;B22F3/1035;;B22F3/1039;;B22F7/062;;B22F7/08;;B22F2201/01,B22F7/04;;B22F3/00;;B29C67/00;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y30/00;;B33Y40/00;;B33Y80/00;;C22C47/02;;C22C47/06;;C22C47/20;;C22C49/14,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

    A method for minimizing the generation of interferometric intermodulation distortion in an analog fiber optic link that employs a directly modulated diode laser as its optical source. This is accomplished via the reduction of frequency chirp in the current-modulated diode laser source ( 32 ). To reduce frequency chirp, the diode laser ( 32 ) is coupled to an external reflector ( 52 ), so that an external laser cavity with a long, passive section is formed. Specifically, the frequency chirp of this extended laser cavity is reduced from that of the original diode laser by the ratio of the optical path length in the external cavity to that in the diode. The external reflector ( 52 ) can also be integrated, via splicing, to the fiber pigtail ( 54 ) of the laser transmitter ( 50 ) so that the compact geometric form factor of a diode transmitter is preserved.

The scatter mask has a pixelated outer surface of tangentially oriented, flat geometric surfaces that are spherically varying in radial dimension that corresponds to a discrete amount of attenuation. Rotation position of the scatter mask is tracked as a function of time. Radiation counts from gamma and/or neutron radiation are received from at least one radiation detector that is positioned at or near the central axis.

   An improved technique for processing a color or gray scale pixel map representing a document is disclosed. The pixel map is decomposed into a three-plane representation, a reduced-resolution upper plane, a reduced-resolution lower plane, and a high-resolution binary selector plane. The upper and lower planes contain the color or gray scale for the page as well as the continuous tone pictures that are contained on the page. The selector plane stores information for selecting from either the foreground plane or background plane during decompression. Information contained in the selector plane is first used to pre-process the upper and lower planes to reduce the amount of data on each of the other two planes that will be subjected to further processing. Each of the pre-processed planes is compressed using a compression technique optimal for the type of data that resides upon it.

   An improved technique for processing a color or gray scale pixel map representing a document is disclosed. The pixel map is decomposed into a three-plane representation, a reduced-resolution upper plane, a reduced-resolution lower plane, and a high-resolution binary selector plane. The upper and lower planes contain the color or gray scale for the page as well as the continuous tone pictures that are contained on the page. The selector plane stores information for selecting from either the foreground plane or background plane during decompression. Information contained in the selector plane is first used to pre-process the upper and lower planes to reduce the amount of data on each of the other two planes that will be subjected to further processing. Each of the pre-processed planes is compressed using a compression technique optimal for the type of data that resides upon it.

   What is disclosed is a method by which a client-side handheld device requests a server to convert server-side documents into a compression format prior to transmission of said documents to the client. The server retrieves and converts the requested documents to a raster image that is then compressed according to attributes based on information received from the client device in the initial document request. Instead of having to manipulate multiple formats which the original documents are in and supported by the server, the client-side device is preferably optimized in hardware and/or software to support and otherwise take advantage of the requested compression format. The compressed document is then delivered to the client device, in whole or in part, selectively or progressively over time per individual requests prior to displaying the received data to the end-user. Depending on the requested delivery mode, server-side documents are preferably compressed using wavelet compression methods, such as the JPEG 2000 standard, known in the arts. Through such a compression format, documents of sizes (in total bytes) exceeding one or more Megabytes can be compressed down to as small as 30 kilobytes or less.

The optical coupler receives the feedback signal and adjusts a coupling alignment of the optical communication path to the optical fiber based on the feedback signal, which indicates the measured power level of the diverted counter-propagating light.",OPENLIGHT PHOTONICS INC,BUCKLEY BRANDON W;;KOCH BRIAN ROBERT;;GARCIA JOHN;;BAUTERS JARED;;SRINIVASAN SUDHARSANAN;;RAMASWAMY ANAND,JUNIPER NETWORKS INC (2018-01-08);;AURRION INC (2022-03-22);;OPENLIGHT PHOTONICS INC (2022-05-13),https://lens.org/065-497-477-506-995,Granted Patent,yes,16,0,6,6,0,H04B10/40;;G02B6/4227;;G02B6/4246;;G02B6/43;;G02B6/30;;G02B6/12;;G02B6/4227;;H04B10/40;;H04B10/25891,G02B6/12;;G02B6/42;;G02B6/30;;G02B6/43;;H04B10/25;;H04B10/40,,10,0,,,"“U.S. Appl.

The optical communication path has a propagation direction away from the transmitter circuit and towards the optical coupler. A counter-propagating tap diverts light sent by a light source backward against the propagation direction of the optical communication path. A photodiode receives the diverted light and measures its power level. The photodiode generates a feedback signal for the optical coupler and provides the feedback signal to the optical coupler. The optical coupler receives the feedback signal and adjusts a coupling alignment of the optical communication path to the optical fiber based on the feedback signal, which indicates the measured power level of the diverted counter-propagating light.",JUNIPER NETWORKS INC,BUCKLEY BRANDON W;;KOCH BRIAN ROBERT;;GARCIA JOHN;;BAUTERS JARED;;SRINIVASAN SUDHARSANAN;;RAMASWAMY ANAND,JUNIPER NETWORKS INC (2018-01-08);;AURRION INC (2022-03-22);;OPENLIGHT PHOTONICS INC (2022-05-13),https://lens.org/079-453-959-401-807,Patent Application,yes,0,1,6,6,0,H04B10/40;;G02B6/4227;;G02B6/4246;;G02B6/43;;G02B6/30;;G02B6/12;;G02B6/4227;;H04B10/40;;H04B10/25891,G02B6/42;;G02B6/12;;G02B6/30;;G02B6/43;;H04B10/25;;H04B10/40,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The system includes a memory for storing program code and a processor for processing the program code. The program codes causes the processor to receive a request from a client (415) over a public network (410) for playing an online video game or executing an online application at a hosting service centre (210) comprised of a plurality of hosting servers (402). The processor also receives control signals (406a, 406b) transmitted from the client (415) over the public network (410) to a first server at the hosting service centre (210). The control signals (406a, 406b) indicate user inputs to the client (415) as the user is playing the video game or using the application. The video game or application is executed on a server (402) at the hosting service centre (402) in response to the control signals (406a, 406b). The execution of the video game or application generates video output comprising sequences of video images of the video game or application. The video output is encoded (at 404) to generate a plurality of compressed video frames or portions thereof. Encoding comprises generating a first set of video frames which are not dependent on previous video frames and a second set of video frames which are dependent on previous video frames. The compressed video frames or portions are streamed over the public network (410) to a client device (415). The compressed video frames or portions are decoded by a decoder (412) on the client (415) and rendered on the client (415) as the user plays the video game or uses the application. The first set of frames are decoded without reference to previous frames and the second set of frames are decoded with reference to previous frames. The operations of receiving control signals (406a, 406b) transmitted from the client device (415) over the public network (410), executing the video game or application, encoding and streaming the low latency video stream over the public network (410) to the client device (415) and decoding the low latency video stream on the client device (415) are performed with a latency such that the user has the perception that the selected video game or application is responding instantly to the control signals (406a, 406b) received from the client device (415).",OL2 INC,PERLMAN STEPHEN G;;VAN DER LAAN ROGER;;COTTER TIMOTHY;;FURMAN SCOTT;;MCCOOL ROBERT;;BUCKLEY IAN,"OL2, INC., US (2013-01-23);;SONY COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT AMERICA LLC, US (2015-06-25)",https://lens.org/103-344-374-115-464,Patent Application,no,0,0,23,402,0,A63F13/12;;A63F2300/407;;A63F2300/534;;A63F2300/535;;A63F2300/538;;A63F2300/552;;A63F2300/577;;H04N7/106;;H04N21/2343;;H04N21/23439;;H04N21/2381;;H04N21/266;;H04N21/6377;;H04N21/658;;H04N21/6583;;H04N21/6587;;H04L65/403;;H04N19/172;;H04N19/169;;H04N19/61;;H04N19/107;;H04N19/132;;H04N19/146;;H04N19/436;;H04N19/188;;H04L65/765;;H04L65/611;;H04L67/131;;H04L65/752;;A63F13/30;;H04N19/107;;H04N19/169;;H04N19/188;;H04N19/436;;H04N7/24;;H04N21/2343;;H04N21/2381;;H04N21/266;;H04N21/6377;;H04N21/658;;A63F2300/407;;A63F13/335;;A63F13/355;;A63F13/358;;A63F2300/407;;A63F2300/534;;A63F2300/535;;A63F2300/538;;A63F2300/552;;A63F2300/577;;H04N7/106;;H04N21/2343;;H04N21/23439;;H04N21/2381;;H04N21/266;;H04N21/6377;;H04N21/658;;H04N21/6583;;H04N21/6587;;H04N19/172;;H04N19/169;;H04N19/61;;H04N19/107;;H04N19/132;;H04N19/146;;H04N19/436;;H04N19/188;;H04L65/403;;H04L65/611;;H04L65/765;;H04L67/131;;A63F13/71;;A63F13/25;;H04N21/234363;;H04N21/25833;;H04N21/2662,H04N7/12;;A63F13/12;;H04L29/06;;H04N7/26;;H04N7/50;;H04N7/66;;H04N19/89;;H04N21/2343;;H04N21/2381;;H04N21/266;;H04N21/6377;;H04N21/658;;H04N21/6583;;H04N21/6587,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The shell defines a cavity for retention of a device component. An interior surface of a shell wall has a scalloped shape configured to distribute compressive forces applied to the shell perimeter such that when the shell is positioned in the canal, the shell wall conforms to the shape of the canal to maintain an acoustical seal between a shell exterior surface and the canal walls. The scalloped shape can be configured to produce a substantially constant amount of inward deformation of a shell wall independent of a force application point on a shell perimeter.

   An envelope stripping apparatus is disclosed for opening and holding open the flaps of envelopes or mail processed in a mailing machine or other envelope-processing machine. The flaps of the envelopes are held down against a vacuum plenum during transport of the envelope. The envelopes are fed along the feeding path towards a moistening device while the flap is stripped and held by the vacuum plenum. An arrangement of the plenum apertures is such that stiffer portions of the flaps have more vacuum applied than those that are of lesser area, or at the extreme end of the flap. A second arrangement of the envelope flaps will cause additional holding of the end of the flap if it is a larger envelope with a greater area at the end such as a square flap.

The mixer leads to a steam precipitation step wherein all fluid ingredients in the mixture are volatilized leaving the solid additive and resin in the desired ratio. This results in a uniform dispersion of the additives in the polymer matrix. As a result of the high dispersion, physical properties of a thermoplastic resin, to which the polymer matrix has been added are preserved. In one illustration, PTFE as a drip inhibitor additive, is added to polycarbonate to obtain a highly dispersed PTFE concentrate of improved drip-inhibition without loss of mechanical properties when added to a thermoplastic molding resin.",GEN ELECTRIC,BHATIA QAMAR S;;BUCKLEY PAUL;;DAVIS GARY;;HOWE ROBERT L;;PAN WIE-HIN;;SHANKLIN ELLIOTT,SABIC INNOVATIVE PLASTIC IP B.V (2007-08-31);;SABIC INNOVATIVE PLASTICS IP B.V (2007-08-31),https://lens.org/104-041-484-764-199,Granted Patent,yes,24,18,3,13,0,C08J3/005;;C08J3/215;;C08L27/12;;C08L27/18;;C08L67/02;;C08L69/00;;C08L101/00;;C08L67/02;;C08L27/12;;C08L101/00;;C08J3/215;;C08L69/00;;C08L27/18;;C08J3/005,C08J3/00;;C08J3/215;;C08L27/12;;C08L27/18;;C08L67/02;;C08L69/00;;C08L101/00,523/206;;523/205;;523/207;;524/546;;524/568;;524/537;;525/146;;525/199;;525/468,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
