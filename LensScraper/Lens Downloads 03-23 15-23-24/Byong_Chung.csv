In the single electron transistor using porous silicon, silicon pores, each of which has a diameter of 5 nm or less, are fabricated by electrochemically etching a silicon on insulator (SOI) substrate having silicon dioxide (SiO _{ 2 } ) in its lower portion using an HF-based solution, and serve as islands of a single electron transistor. Also, a source and a drain are formed of silicon on which metal is deposited or silicon doped with impurities. Hence, formation of islands and tunnel barriers is easy, mass production is possible, and the sizes of islands can be controlled by oxidation, so that single electron transistors capable of operating at room temperature can be easily fabricated.

In the single electron transistor using porous silicon, silicon pores, each of which has a diameter of 5 nm or less, are fabricated by electrochemically etching a silicon on insulator (SOI) substrate having silicon dioxide (SiO ₂ ) in its lower portion using an HF-based solution, and serve as islands of a single electron transistor. Also, a source and a drain are formed of silicon on which metal is deposited or silicon doped with impurities. Hence, formation of islands and tunnel barriers is easy, mass production is possible, and the sizes of islands can be controlled by oxidation, so that single electron transistors capable of operating at room temperature can be easily fabricated.

    A single electron transistor using porous silicon, which is fabricated by applying porous silicon having a size of several tens of nanometers obtained by electrochemically etching silicon, and a fabrication method thereof, are provided. In the single electron transistor using porous silicon, silicon pores, each of which has a diameter of 5 nm or less, are fabricated by electrochemically etching a silicon on insulator (SOI) substrate having silicon dioxide (SiO _{ 2 } ) in its lower portion using an HF-based solution, and serve as islands of a single electron transistor. Also, a source and a drain are formed of silicon on which metal is deposited or silicon doped with impurities. Hence, formation of islands and tunnel barriers is easy, mass production is possible, and the sizes of islands can be controlled by oxidation, so that single electron transistors capable of operating at room temperature can be easily fabricated.

    Disclosed is a process for the production of optically pure (S)-beta-hydroxy-gamma-butyrolactone through the hydrogenation of substituted carboxylic acid derivatives. A solution containing 1 to 50% by weight of a substituted carboxylic acid derivative is fed at a WHSV of 0.1 to 10 h ¹ , to a fixed bed reactor which is filled with a catalyst and maintained at a reaction temperature of 50 to 550 C. under a halogen partial pressure of 15 to 5,500 psig. The catalyst is composed of a noble metal as a catalytically effective ingredient which is impregnated in an inorganic oxide as a support. The molar ratio of the hydrogen to the substituted carboxylic acid derivative is maintained at a molar ratio of 1:1 to 10:1. The process can produce optically pure (S)-beta-hydroxy-gamma-butyrolactone with higher purities at higher yields than can conventional techniques. In addition to being relatively simple and environmentally friendly, the process is so economically favorable as to apply to industrial production.
