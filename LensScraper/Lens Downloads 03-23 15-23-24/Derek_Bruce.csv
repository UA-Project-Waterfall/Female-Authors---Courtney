Vehicles compute their own control in parallel, and receive communicated position and velocity error trajectories from their immediate predecessor. Leader-follower string stability requires additional communication from the lead car at each update, in the form of a position error trajectory. Communication from the lead car is required only once at initialization. Provided an initially feasible solution can be found, subsequent feasibility of the algorithms are guaranteed at every update.

Distributed receding horizon control algorithms are presented to derive sufficient conditions that guarantee asymptotic stability, leader-follower string stability, and predecessor-follower string stability, following a step speed change in the platoon. Vehicles compute their own control in parallel, and receive communicated position and velocity error trajectories from their immediate predecessor. Leader-follower string stability requires additional communication from the lead car at each update, in the form of a position error trajectory. Communication from the lead car is required only once at initialization. Provided an initially feasible solution can be found, subsequent feasibility of the algorithms are guaranteed at every update. The theory is generalized for nonlinear decoupled dynamics, and is thus applicable to fleets of planes, robots, or boats, in addition to cars.",CAVENEY DEREK STANLEY;;DUNBAR WILLIAM BRUCE;;TOYOTA MOTOTR ENGINEERING & MFG NORTH AMERICA INC,CAVENEY DEREK STANLEY;;DUNBAR WILLIAM BRUCE,TOYOTA JIDOSHA KABUSHIKI KAISHA (2014-01-09);;TOYOTA MOTOR ENGINEERING & MANUFACTURING NORTH AMERICA (TEMA) (2012-02-06),https://lens.org/032-148-480-946-286,Granted Patent,yes,15,49,2,2,0,G05D1/0295;;B60W2556/65;;G05D1/0295;;B60W2556/65,G06F19/00,701/31.5,24,22,081-964-585-041-443;;081-964-585-041-443;;054-163-700-599-129;;143-766-388-913-943;;119-836-607-047-477;;004-273-637-164-23X;;076-038-596-954-842;;073-006-264-377-588;;143-746-233-635-362;;033-610-606-174-845;;031-009-302-949-760;;000-901-721-663-022;;049-405-548-889-452;;159-942-939-358-685;;060-892-176-261-240;;036-522-845-129-776;;049-095-716-607-805;;111-019-717-471-26X;;017-091-715-352-805;;014-913-382-327-935;;167-836-799-684-606;;000-089-544-218-926,10.1109/87.865854;;10.1109/87.865854;;10.1007/bf02192114;;10.1109/37.980246;;10.1016/s0005-1098(98)00073-9;;10.1109/tac.2007.900828;;10.1016/j.automatica.2005.12.008;;10.1109/tac.2007.914956;;10.1109/tac.2005.854584;;10.1016/j.automatica.2006.07.008;;10.3182/20090902-3-us-2007.00025;;10.1109/tcst.2007.899152;;10.1016/j.automatica.2009.10.033;;10.1016/s0005-1098(99)00214-9;;10.1109/9.262032;;10.1109/acc.2003.1242570;;10.1109/9.486636;;10.1109/acc.2005.1469944;;10.1109/cdc.2008.4738740;;10.1109/cdc.2008.4739412;;10.1109/tac.2006.872826;;10.1109/cdc.2005.1583235,"Stankovic, S.S.;

A determination as to which implementation of a virtual overridden method to inline is made based on its relative “hotness” compared to the other implementations of the same method. The relative hotness can be inferred from the invocation count and sampling count that the virtual machine and the just-in-time compiler already collect for other purposes, that is, without collecting and storing of call-edge profiling information. When a method is being compiled and it is identified that the method contains a call to an overridden method, a candidate for inlining from among the implementations of the overridden method is selected based on relative hotness values.

UNITED KINGDOM ATOMIC ENERGY AUTHORITY 7 Aug., 1969 [19 June, 1968; 5 May, 1969], No. 29319/68. Heading H2J. [Also in Division G3] An electric motor 11 is controlled so that the phase of pulses derived from its rotor 12 relative to separately generated reference pulses is kept constant by energizing the motor so that its speed is dependent upon the reference pulses, to which pulses are added or subtracted in response to the output of a phase comparator. The motor is one of a number of hysteresis motors phased locked to the reference source whose rotors comprise shutters in a neutron time-of-flight spectrometer. The motor is supplied from a static alternator 14 comprising thyristor switches in series with transformer windings (Fig. 2, not shown), the thyristors being triggered sequentially by a commutator 15 which receives the adjusted reference pulses, to produce a three phase output. The reference pulses are produced by a ""clock"" 16 and are divided by N at 22 to provide six pulses per revolution, and by 6N at 25 for comparison with once per revolution pulses from a coil 24 which is swept by a magnetic insert 23 in the rotor in a phase comparator 26. The rotor pulses may be delayed at 27 by a quantized number of clock pulses to provide phase adjustment. The comparator 26 adds or subtracts single pulses to those entering the divider 22. The output 22 is connected to the ""commutator"" 15 via an ""amplitude/time"" converter 21 which imposes a small delay proportinal to variations in the motor current the purpose of which is to damp out rotor oscillations which are reflected in this current. The reference pulses may alternatively be derived from a computer which may be programmed to produce a number of different speeds and phase relationships. In Fig. 3 (not shown) the ""commutator"" 15 may be switched to receive pulses from a pickup coil (33) swept by magnetic marks on the rotor (two marks per pole per phase) so that the motor may be accelerated synchronously, and a variable delay circuit is incorporated so that the slip angle, and hence the torque may be adjusted. Alternatively, the pick-up coil may be rotated contrary to the direction of the rotor; the motor would then operate non- synchronously at maximum torque.",ATOMIC ENERGY AUTHORITY UK,RUSSELL MICHAEL CUNNINGHAM BAR;;SMITH DEREK BRUCE JACK,,https://lens.org/007-894-659-338-57X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H02P6/06;;H02P23/186;;H02P25/03,H02P6/06;;H02P23/00;;H02P25/02,G3R RBN33         BN33;;G3R RB382         BN33;;G3R R110X         R33D;;G3R R112C         R33D;;G3R R33D3A        R33D;;G3R R4            R33D;;G3R R7R           R33D;;G3R R7T           R33D;;G3R R71           R33D;;G3R R8R           R33D;;G3R R9C           R33D;;G3R R9H           R33D;;H2J JCC           JCC;;H2J JSVF          JSVF;;H2J J1J           J1U;;H2J J1U           J1U;;H2J J1X           J1U;;H2J J12C          J1U;;H2J J12N1         J1U;;H2J J12N3A        J1U;;H2J J12N3Y        J1U,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The method entails contacting an aqueous Cs-containing solution with a solvent consisting of a specific class of lipophilic calix[4]arene-crown ether extractants dissolved in a hydrocarbon-based diluent containing a specific class of alkyl-aromatic ether alcohols as modifiers. The cesium values are subsequently recovered from the extractant, and the solvent subsequently recycled, by contacting the Cs-containing organic solution with an aqueous stripping solution. This combined extraction and stripping method is especially useful as a process for removal of the radionuclide cesium-137 from highly alkaline waste solutions which are also very concentrated in sodium and potassium. No pre-treatment of the waste solution is necessary, and the cesium can be recovered using a safe and inexpensive stripping process using water, dilute (millimolar) acid solutions, or dilute (millimolar) salt solutions. An important application for this invention would be treatment of alkaline nuclear tank wastes.

The cesium values are subsequently recovered from the extractant, and the solvent subsequently recycled, by contacting the Cs-containing organic solution with an aqueous stripping solution. This combined extraction and stripping method is especially useful as a process for removal of the radionuclide cesium-137 from highly alkaline waste solutions which are also very concentrated in sodium and potassium.

Method involves determining whether an intravascular device is associated with a clinical system. Method involves performing, with the help of a treatment component of an intravascular device, a logic authentication procedure to determine whether an intravascular device for clinical operation is authorized. Logical authentication procedure is performed in response to the determination that the intravascular device is in communication with the clinical system and without providing a clinical system for accessing intravascular device data stored in the intravascular device. Method comprises a stage of feeding, in response to determination by means of a processing component, that the intravascular device is authorized for clinical operation, an authorization signal to the clinical system. Intravascular device comprises a flexible elongated element including a sensory component in the distal portion and a connector in the proximal portion. Connector is configured to provide direct or indirect communication with the clinical system. Connector includes a memory component configured to store a parameter value. Connector has a processing component having a memory component. Connector contains a charge accumulation component configured to supply a memory component and a processing component. Processing component is configured to perform, in response to the determination that the intravascular device is in communication with the clinical system and without providing the clinical system with access to the memory component, logic authentication procedure to determine whether a flexible elongated member is authorized for clinical operation by determining whether the parameter value is greater or less than the threshold value. Intravascular system comprises an intravascular device, a clinical system comprising a computing device in direct or indirect communication with an intravascular device. Clinical system is designed to allow or prohibit the clinical operation of the intravascular device in response to a signal received from the intravascular device, reflecting the determination of the treatment component, whether the intravascular device is authorized for clinical work.EFFECT: technical result is comprehensively preventing the use of unauthorized, falsified and/or otherwise forged intravascular devices.15 cl, 6 dwg",KONINKLIJKE PHILIPS NV,KENNEDY TIMOTHY J;;SPRAGUE DAVID;;SPROUL JASON Y;;HARRINGTON FRANK;;ELDRIDGE DEREK BRUCE;;BITNER TODD;;JOHANSSON ANDREAS,,https://lens.org/059-909-753-832-799,Granted Patent,no,6,0,15,15,0,A61B5/027;;A61B8/56;;G06F21/85;;A61B1/00062;;A61B2562/226;;H04L2209/88;;H04W4/80;;A61B1/0002;;A61B1/00059;;A61B1/00124;;H04L67/12;;A61B5/0066;;A61B5/0215;;A61B8/12;;G06F21/44;;H04W12/065;;A61B1/00097;;A61B1/00062;;A61B5/027;;G06F21/85;;H04W4/80;;A61B1/00059;;A61B2562/226;;H04L2209/88;;A61B1/0002;;A61B1/00124;;A61B8/56;;H04L67/12;;A61B1/00062;;H04W12/065;;A61B5/0066;;A61B5/0215;;A61B5/026;;A61B8/12;;G06F21/44,A61B8/12,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The adapter bracket allows the orientation of the left-hand drive designed steering gear to remain the same in a right-hand drive installation as when installed in the left-hand drive. As a result, the pitman arm (18) that directs the wheel direction of steering and is outboard of the steering gear for left-hand drive applications, is inboard of the steering gear for right-hand drive applications.

The adapter bracket allows pitman arm operation through an operating slot (51) in spite of the location of the pitman arm between the steering gear and the frame rail (103). The adapter bracket and steering gear are mounted to the frame rail. The pitman arm is pivotably connected to a drag link (19) that in turn is pivotably connected to a steering arm (20).

When the system decides that there is a possibility of freezing conditions and freezing might occur, the system starts a purge shutdown of the fuel cell system, then water is purged from the reaction gas flow channel.
