The curved drilling trajectories avoid regions of low bone mineral density, such that flexible implants and/or U-bridge implants driven into the curved drilling trajectories are anchored in regions of high bone mineral density to improve the stability of bone fixation. The flexible implants and U-bridge implants are suitable for several applications, including but not limited to spinal fixation, orthopedic bone fixation, and neurosurgery.",UNIV TEXAS;;ASCENSION SETON;;ALAMBEIGI FARSHID;;SHAHRABI AMIR HOSSEIN ESKANDARI;;COHEN ALEXANDER;;AMADIO JORDAN,ALAMBEIGI FARSHID;;SHAHRABI AMIR;;COHEN ALEXANDER;;AMADIO JORDAN,,https://lens.org/062-983-502-019-190,Patent Application,yes,6,0,2,2,0,A61F2/28;;A61F2002/30289;;A61B17/1642;;A61B17/1671;;A61B17/869;;A61B17/8625;;A61B17/863;;A61B17/8635;;A61B17/866;;A61B2090/064;;A61B17/864;;A61B2017/8655;;B33Y50/00;;B22F10/28;;B22F10/80;;B22F5/06;;B22F10/40;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y80/00;;A61B17/7035;;A61B17/7061,A61B17/68;;A61B17/00;;A61B17/56;;A61B17/84;;A61B17/86;;A61F2/28,,0,0,,,,PENDING

These data may be utilized to analyze therapeutic efficacy, to enable early detection of complications, and to guide the clinical management of patients being treated with a fluid drain. Advantageously, these systems, devices, methods, and computer-readable media enable clinical patient care decisions to be performed in a manner that is data-driven or quantitative in nature as opposed to qualitative—e.g., via well-defined, algorithmic-based processes and/or reliable methods.
