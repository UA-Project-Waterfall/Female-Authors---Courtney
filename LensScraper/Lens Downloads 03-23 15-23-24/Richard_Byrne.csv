Specifically, the cleat assembly is configured such that an improper over-tightening of the cleat onto the sole of a user's shoe has substantially no effect on the free flexing of the spring clip while it is engaging or disengaging to/from the pedal. In addition, the cleat assembly incorporates one or more soft elastomeric caps (48f',48r') that frictionally engage the ground when the user walks about, to provide improved traction and to eliminate undesired wear of critical assembly components. Further, for embodiments of cleat assemblies of the kind incorporating one or more adjustable set screws for adjustable set screws for adjusting the assemblies' float angles, threaded apertures (66f,66r) for the set screws (64f,64r) are formed by the confronting surfaces of a plastic upper plate and a metallic bottom plate (20'), wherein the threads are formed only in the plastic upper plate (18'). This allows the upper plate to be conveniently formed of an injection-molded plastic material and the bottom plate to be conveniently stamped from a piece of sheet metal. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, one or more holes (82) are formed in the confronting surfaces of the metallic bottom plate, allowing the one or more set screws to contact the elastomeric material of the cap or caps, inhibiting the one or more set screws from working their way loose from the cleat assembly. In another embodiment of the invention, the upper plate and the bottom plate are configured to stay secured together both prior to the initial installation of the cleat assembly and also in the event that the user detaches the cleat assembly from the shoe.

The head F is similarly swivelled to the casing, and carries pivoted dogs f, f<1> threaded at their lower ends to engage with the screw B. Outside the head F is the cap provided with a handle, not shown. Within the cap are cams i, i<4>, which act respectively on the lower and upper ends of the dogs and serve to force them into or out of engagement with the screw. The spring K bearing against the cap and nut k raises the screw, and thus withdraws the cutters. The tool is operated by turning the screw by a wrench applied at the end b after the dogs have been engaged with the screw.",O'NEILL RICHARD JOHN;;BYRNE TIMOTHY,O'NEILL RICHARD JOHN;;BYRNE TIMOTHY,,https://lens.org/055-931-023-880-858,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The improvement comprising the addition of an internal buttress-type welded joint located between the inside surface of each side plate and one or both transverse rods with at least one bendable section. During use, the transverse rod is allowed to bend so that the side plates may deflect when force is exerted on them. By adding the welded joint and by adding the bendable section to the transverse rod, the number of cracks or breaks in the conveyor belt is substantially reduced.

HOLOTRON CORP. 21 Feb., 1969 [6 March, 1968], No. 9395/69. Heading H4D. [Also in Division G2] An ultrasonic hologram is formed by directing a first ultrasonic beam from a transducer towards a hologram detecting surface, and directing a second ultrasonic beam through a test object and then through the transducer to interfere with the first beam at the detecting surface. This allows short path lengths for the beams (hence low attenuation) and a small angle between the beams (without the object blocking the first beam) so that a high quality hologram can be formed using high ultrasonic frequencies, e.g. greater than 20 MHz. As shown the first beam is generated by quartz plate transducer 61 and is incident at angle # r on detecting surface 63 which comprises a thin liquid film 79 (e.g. of water, mineral oil, silicone oil or a fluorocarbon) supported on an acoustically transparent sheet of metal or plastics (e.g. polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polyvinyl chloride) in a frame 77. The second beam is generated by quartz transducer 65 supported in liquid-filled tank 71 and passes through test object 67 and through transducer 61, the transducer thicknesses being odd multiples of a half-wavelength at the operating ultrasonic frequency so that transducer 61 is acoustically transparent. Frame 77 isolates surface 63 from disturbing vibrations of the body of liquid 73.

    An improved endless conveyor belt made of a plurality of interconnected links, each including two rods with two side plates perpendicularly aligned and attached to their opposite ends. The improvement comprising the addition of an internal buttress-type welded joint located between the inside surface of each side plate and one or both transverse rods with at least one bendable section. During use, the transverse rod is allowed to bend so that the side plates may deflect when force is exerted on them. By adding the welded joint and by adding the bendable section to the transverse rod, the number of cracks or breaks in the conveyor belt is substantially reduced.

Ltd. 6 April, 1966 [12 April, 1965], No. 15571/65. Heading H2A. In a dynamo-electric machine comprising within a housing 11 a rotor 12 having a shaft 13 at one end and concentrically disposed between a first magnetic assembly 33 or 30 comprising an annular field coil 36 and a second magnetic assembly 30 or 33 comprising an armature winding 31, the rotor 12 has two annular magnetic members 22, 23 which are spaced apart by a non-magnetic spacer 24 each of the magnetic members carries a set of polepieces 25 which are interdigitated and the rotor 12 is supported for rotation by first and second bearing means 14, 15 at its ends, and the inner one of the magnetic assemblies 33 is supported at one of its ends from the housing 11 and at its other end from the rotor 12 through a third bearing means 40. The connection between the stator 30 and the housing 11 may be resilient. As shown the stator 30 is mounted by a roller bearing 40 on a rotor shaft extension 41. The rotor is formed of two magnetic rings 22, 23, having claw-like polepieces 25 separated by a brass ring 24 which are all clamped together by bolts 26 or alternatively secured by brazing. With D.C. supplied to the field coil 36 the poles 34, 35 provide the rotor polepieces 25 with alternate polarities. As shown in the form of an A.C. generator, if the shaft 13 is coupled to a prime mover, A.C. is generated in the outer stator winding 31. The positions of the D.C. wound stator 33 and A.C. wound stator 30 may be interchanged. When the outer stator 30 has an A.C. winding it may be arranged to rotate and may carry rectifiers so as to form a D.C. generator. The machine can also operate as a synchronous motor or as an electromagnetic slip coupling or brake.",ENGLISH ELECTRIC CO LTD,BYRNE JAMES ANTHONY;;GLEDHILL JOHN RICHARD,,https://lens.org/188-146-970-950-542,Granted Patent,no,0,8,1,1,0,H02K19/24,H02K19/24,H2A AQF           QF;;H2A ARK           RK;;H2A AVP           VP;;H2A A1A           -;;H2A A1C10B        -;;H2A A1C8          -;;H2A A1E2          -;;H2A A1G           -;;H2A A13B          A13Z;;H2A A13X          -;;H2A A16M          -;;H2A A2CX          -;;H2A A2C5          A2CZ;;H2A A24           A1A;;H2A A25A          A13Z,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The bridge receives a command from a first bus, the command having an identification field and an address field. As the command is entered into a buffer in the bridge, the address field is checked against one or more addresses. If there is a match, then control bits are checked to see if the command will be allowed or not depending on the identification field value. If the command is not transferred to the second bus, a flag is set in the buffer, and an error message is returned to the first bus, and an interrupt may be generated. The control bits allow commands access to specific addresses on the second bus or deny the access depending on the command identification field.

Once the command with the same identification field value is removed from the buffer, the received command is entered into the buffer. Next, the buffered command is transmitted over a second bus. A response to the command is eventually received from the second bus, the response is transmitted over the first bus, and the command is then removed from the buffer.

A rhenium-containing hydrogenation catalyst comprised of rhenium on a support material is regenerated by first treating the catalyst with aqueous perrhenic acid or potassium perrhenate followed by treating the catalyst under reducing conditions at elevated temperature and pressure. Treatment of the catalyst as described replenishes dispersed fresh finely divided rhenium which enhances the activity of the catalyst while at the same time allowing the operations to be carried out in situ in the hydrogenation reactor or in a side stream reactor with significant savings in reducing reactor down time and precious metal expenses.",DU PONT,ERNST RICHARD EDWARD;;MICHEL JOHN BYRNE;;CAMPOS DANIEL,E.I.

Holography. HOLOTRON CORP. Dec.29, 1967 [Dec.30, 1966; Sept.12, 1967; Dec.18, 1967], No.59153/67. Headings G2C and G2J. [Also in Division H4] Ultrasonic holograms from which multiple images, in different colours, of an object can be reconstructed are formed by directing ultrasonic energy including at least two distinct ultrasonic frequencies via the object to a hologram-detecting surface in a fluid medium and also directly to the detecting surface, the two frequencies of the directly transmitted energy being respectively coherent with the two frequencies of the energy transmitted via the object. In the Fig. 7 embodiment for detecting internal tumours in the body from the relative capacities of the body to 3MHz and 9MHz ultrasonic waves, 30Ás pulses alternately of 3MHz and 9MHz and at 500Ás intervals are applied to transducers 15 and 19 in parallel to provide ""reference"" and ""object"" ultrazonic beams, respectively, which interfere to give two different standing-wave patterns (holograms) in water surface 17. Collimated light from a mercury arc source 20 is diffracted by the standing waves into several beams which are focused to spatially separated points by lens 24. The separation of the points is a function of both the ultrasonic frequency # and the light wavelength X. An apertured mask 25 blocks all beams except (a) the first order real image beam diffracted from the hologram formed with ultrasonic frequency 3MHz and illuminated by wavelength # 1 and (b) the first order real image beam for the hologram formed with ultrasonic frequency 9MHz and illuminated by wavelength # 2 . Lens segments 44, 45 and optional prism 49 convert these two beams to equal-size images which coincide at 50 to provide a composite two-colour image when viewed. This image is scanned by a vidicon tube 51 supplying a television monitor 53. A shutter 54 blocks light in the intervals between the 30Ás ultrasonic pulses. Instead of producing real images from the two first order beams, light from the zero or another order diffracted beam may be made to interfere with the first order beams from mask 25 (if source 20 is replaced by a coherent source) and the resulting holograms are then recorded on photographic film Fig.3, (not shown) for subsequent reconstruction. In various modifications (a) the ""object"" ultrasonic beam is formed by reflection from, rather than transmission through, the object; (b) two pairs of transducers are used (one pair for each frequency); (c) the two ultrasonic frequencies are generated simultaneously instead of alternately; (d) two vidicon tubes supplying a single television monitor scan the images from lenses 44, 45 respectively to produce the composite image; (e) a colour filter wheel synchronized with the switching between the different ultrasonic frequencies intercepts the light from a monochromatic source used to illuminate the ultrasonic holograms, or mask 25 may be provided with different coloured filters if a monochromatic source is used.",HOLOTRON CORP,BRENDEN BYRON BYRNE;;NEELEY VICTOR ISAAC;;HOEGGER DAVID RICHARD,,https://lens.org/046-564-549-767-528,Granted Patent,no,0,0,8,11,0,G03H5/00;;G03H5/00;;G03H3/00;;G03H3/00;;Y10S359/901;;Y10S359/901,G03H3/00;;G03H5/00,G1G GMD           MD;;G1G GPB           PB;;G1G G1A           MD;;G1G G1A           PB;;G1G G3C           MD;;G1G G3C           PB;;G1G G3R           MD;;G1G G3R           PB;;G1G G4C           MD;;G1G G4C           PB;;G1G G6            MD;;G1G G6            PB;;G1G G7T           MD;;G1G G7T           PB;;G2J J33B          -;;G2J J33BX         J33BX,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The spacecraft mounts at three points to the cradle, and the cradle mounts at three points to the shuttle such that a plane through the attachment points passes through the roll axis of the spacecraft at approximately the center of mass thereof. The cradle utilizes the truss structure of the spacecraft to produce the required stiffness by providing a structural tie between the two ends and the bottom of the cradle. At launch, the spacecraft is ejected with both linear and angular momentum, the spin providing gyroscopic stability. The locking mechanisms in the cradle can be remotely controlled to relock the spacecraft to the cradle in the event of an unsuccessful deployment attempt. The spacecraft includes a safety circuit employing acceleration sensing switches which sense spin-up of the spacecraft and prevent premature ignition of the perigee boost motor. The spacecraft has imbedded within its envelope a solid-propellant perigee boost motor surrounded by a liquid-propellant apogee motor. By employing apogee and perigee propulsion stages internal to the spacecraft, the storage length in the space shuttle is minimized, and the geometry and mass characteristics of the spacecraft make for a stable spinning vehicle during both the perigee and apogee boost phases.",HUGHES AIRCRAFT CO,BYRNE ALLAN B;;OTIS RICHARD G;;ROBINSON STEPHEN A,HUGHES ELECTRONICS CORPORATION (1997-12-16),https://lens.org/131-396-800-303-813,Granted Patent,yes,4,18,1,1,0,B64G1/641;;B64G1/645;;Y10T403/32565;;Y10T403/598;;F16B2200/69;;Y10T403/32565;;Y10T403/598;;B64G1/645;;B64G1/641;;F16B2200/69,B64G1/64,244158R,1,0,,,"""Syncom IV Space Shuttle Orbital Flight Test Mission"", presented to Public Service Satellite Consortium Conference, Dec. 1976.",EXPIRED

Smoke, consuming.-Smoke from a boiler furnace is passed over one or two special smoke-consuming furnaces arranged in the flue leading to beneath the boiler or to the stack. The smoke-consuming furnace may also consume smoke from its own fire. As shown in Fig. 1, a damper C controls the passage of the furnace gases from the boiler B to the furnace A. The gases pass between fingers j mounted on the dead-plate J. Air, steam, gas, or the like may be injected &c. through the fingers j, which are hollow and are provided with slots j<1>. The side walls of the furnace are made hollow for the circulation of air, which becomes heated and is delivered through perforated pipes E. Air distributors G are arranged beneath the grate for the supply of air, which enters through slots H, Fig. 7, the supply being regulated by dampers I. The furnace roof is preferably inclined slightly and provided with baffle-blocks F. In the modification shown in Fig. 4, a double arch a, a<1> is provided, the space between the two arches being controlled by a damper C which is closed when smoke is not passing from the boiler. In this Figure, a pipe L is shown leading air through one of the fingers j to the furnace. In a further modification, two furnaces are superposed and arranged in series.

A single pressure to electrical signal transducer forms one side of a common predetermined volume chamber and responds to pressure signals channeled to the chamber as a result of selective actuation from a plurality of sample ports wherein open connections may be established in random order or by predetermined sequence for measurements in the sample mode. A plurality of individual (energizeable linear solenoid) valve rods, disposed in proximity with the predetermined volume, minimizes the common volume and length of passageway between the valve rods and the transducer, substantially eliminating restrictions therebetween, thus decreasing the time required for the transducer to respond to one pressure signal from any given port. A second (and/or third) position of the valve rods serves to connect high-pressure fluid to all conduits sequentially (one at a time) for the diagnostic mode; and, simultaneously for the purging mode. Logical controls select the connections to be established, modes of operation, and analyze output conditions for locating any restrictions to determine sources of error.",WALTER J MOORE;;RICHARD T CUSICK;;MICHAEL D BYRNE JR,MOORE WALTER J;;CUSICK RICHARD T;;BYRNE MICHAEL D JR,,https://lens.org/051-551-922-897-223,Granted Patent,no,8,15,1,1,0,G01L19/0015;;G01L19/0015;;G01L19/083;;G01L19/083;;Y10T137/86389;;Y10T137/86389,G01L19/00;;G01L19/08,73/420;;137/624.11;;340/243;;340/413,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A process monitor within the bridge allows for measuring latency of commands issued on a first bus, passing through the bridge, and executed by clients coupled to the second bus. By using identification fields associated with the command, measuring the latency of each command begins with matching the identification field of the command to an integer. As the bridge passes acknowledgements back to the first bus, the monitoring of the command is stopped when an identification field associated with an acknowledgement matches the identification field of the command being monitored. Data collected include the minimum, maximum, total latency, and the number of commands monitored. From this data, the average latency can be easily calculated.",BYRNE RICHARD J;;MASTERS DAVID S;;POLLOCK STEVEN J;;BETKER MICHAEL R;;LSI CORP,BYRNE RICHARD J;;MASTERS DAVID S;;POLLOCK STEVEN J;;BETKER MICHAEL R,AVAGO TECHNOLOGIES GENERAL IP (SINGAPORE) PTE.

A process monitor within the bridge allows for measuring latency of commands issued on a first bus, passing through the bridge, and executed by clients coupled to the second bus. By using identification fields associated with the command, measuring the latency of each command begins with matching the identification field of the command to an integer. As the bridge passes acknowledgements back to the first bus, the monitoring of the command is stopped when an identification field associated with an acknowledgement matches the identification field of the command being monitored. Data collected include the minimum, maximum, total latency, and the number of commands monitored. From this data, the average latency can be easily calculated.",BYRNE RICHARD J;;MASTERS DAVID S;;POLLOCK STEVEN J;;BETKER MICHAEL R,BYRNE RICHARD J;;MASTERS DAVID S;;POLLOCK STEVEN J;;BETKER MICHAEL R,AVAGO TECHNOLOGIES GENERAL IP (SINGAPORE) PTE.

The attachment arrangement acts as its own snap. The retainer clip has a spring mechanism. The installer installs the attachment arrangement to a through hole, for example, in a vehicle roof panel. As the retainer clip passes through the through hole, it collapses around the body of the cast. After the retainer clip passes completely through the through hole, the spring mechanism causes the retainer clip to rebound back to its original span to temporarily hold the antenna module in place. The installer then tightens the bolt, thereby stroking the integrated retainer clip up the cast toward the vehicle roof panel. When the retainer clip contacts the vehicle roof panel, the installer further tightens the bolt to a recommended drive torque.

Arrangements are provided to join the flow passages between the inlet and outlet header pipes, in heat exchanging contact with hot gas flow channels in the heat exchanger, as well as to connect the air flow channels with the interior of the header pipes at selected points around the circumference of the header pipers, so that part of the compressed air fed through into them passes through the flow channels. Used for high performance plate regenerators of great weight as used e.g. in gas turbine compressor systems for gas pipelines. The heat exchanging arrangement is designed so that the high mechanical and thermal loadings occurring during operation are diminished, to allow the heat exchanger core to absorb these loadings and avoid high degrees of stress. An optimal rigidity of the arrangement accompanied by great flexibility is thus achieved. Heat exchangers of this type are used in regenerated turbine systems in the range of 5,000 to 100,000 H.P. The exhaust gases have a temp. is approx. 590 degrees C and heat the compressed air to 480 degrees C. The regenerator runs for 120,000 hrs. and 5,000 cycles without planned overhaul and has a life of 15 to 20 years of normal operation.",GARRETT CORP,MORSE CALVIN J;;KOSSUTH GABOR;;MASAI JOHN F;;JACOBSEN FRED W;;BYRNE JOHN P;;GRAVES RICHARD F;;BRIDGNELL DAVID G;;KRETZINGER KARL F,,https://lens.org/160-583-070-985-650,Patent Application,no,2,10,3,76,0,F28D9/0043;;F28D21/0003;;F28F9/005;;F28F9/0075;;F28F9/04;;F28F2225/08;;F28F2240/00;;F28F2265/26;;F28F2230/00,F28D9/00;;F28F9/00;;F28F9/007;;F28F9/04,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
