That sensing operation occurs relatively soon after the logic level of the data element begins to be established at the input of the sense amplifier. Such a sense amplifier is referred to as having increased sensitivity due to an improved common mode rejection ratio. The common mode rejection ratio is improved by turning-on a pair of evaluate transistors in a successive manner. The sense amplifier includes a pair of discharge paths for allowing a charge, stored on associated internal signals, to be discharged at a given rate that is proportional to voltage levels of the associated data signals. Those data signals are isolated from the discharge paths such that the associated logic levels are not affected by the above mentioned discharge operation. An evaluate unit is connected to the discharge paths and conveys a first portion of the above mentioned charge to electrical ground at an initial rate. At a later time, the evaluate unit conveys a second portion of charge to electrical ground at a subsequent rate, such that the sensitivity of the sense amplifier is improved.",COMPAQ COMPUTER CORP,CHU JEFF L;;BAILEY DANIEL W;;CANTIN JASON F,COMPAQ INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES GROUP L.P (1999-12-09);;DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION (1999-01-29);;HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT LP (2015-10-27);;HEWLETT-PACKARD DEVELOPMENT COMPANY L.P (2002-10-01),https://lens.org/140-267-797-682-052,Granted Patent,yes,5,6,1,1,0,G11C11/419;;G11C11/419;;G11C7/062;;G11C7/062,G11C7/06;;G11C11/419,327/51;;327/52;;327/54;;327/55;;327/57,5,4,023-797-524-928-324;;102-247-747-887-280;;036-637-837-229-216;;010-069-308-686-706,10.1109/5.663545;;10.1109/4.772419;;10.1109/jssc.1996.542315;;10.1109/lpe.1997.621200,"Chuang, Ching Te et al., SOI for Digital CMOS VLSI : Design Considerations and Advances, Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(4): 689 720 (Apr. 1998).;;Glasser, Lance A., and Dobberpuhl, Daniel W., The Design and Analysis of VLSI Circuits, (MA: Addison Wesley Publishing), pp. 286 289 (1985).;;Matson, M. et al., A 600MHz Superscalar Floating Point Processor, Paper on EV6 Fbox given at European Solid State Circuits Conference, (Sep. 1998).;;Montanaro, James et al., A 160 MHZ, 32 b, 0.5 W CMOS RISC Microprocessor, IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, 31(11) 1703 1714 (Nov. 1996).;;Jiang, June et al., High Performance, Low Power Design Techniques for Dynamic to Static Logic Interface, Proceedings 1997 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design, Monterey, CA, Aug. 18 20, 1997, pp. 12 17.",EXPIRED

As the switching network is operated to electrically bias the tile segments by using data corresponding to the ink image, these tile segments transition from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, thereby the electrically-biased hydrophilic tile segments attract moisture from water in a trough or from water vapor produced by an ultrasonic transducer in the trough. The moisture is carried by the electrically-biased tile segments to the substrate at areas where the amount of ink in a portion of the substrate on the other side of the substrate exceeds a predetermined ink coverage threshold.SELECTED DRAWING: Figure 1",XEROX CORP,SEEMIT PRAHARAJ;;HERRMANN DOUGLAS K;;JASON M LEFEVRE;;MCCONVILLE PAUL J;;LIU CHU-HENG,,https://lens.org/004-071-902-488-230,Patent Application,no,0,0,6,6,0,B41J11/0005;;B41J11/002;;B41J3/543;;B41J29/393;;B41J11/0015;;B41J11/0005;;B41J2/04578;;B41J2/04588;;B41J29/38;;B41J11/002;;B41J2/21;;B41J11/0015;;B41J3/543;;B41J11/0015,B65H29/70;;B05B17/06;;B05C1/08;;B05C5/00;;B05C9/14;;B05C11/10;;B41J2/01;;B41J2/205;;B41J11/42,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

For example, the system may use multi-stage cleaning using a rules-based and an artificial intelligence (AI)-based filter to filter large quantities of event items that may not be relevant to a domain of interest. The AI-based filter may be trained using labeled event items that were previously known to be impactful. The system may cluster the cleaned event items to group similar event items and eliminate redundancy. The system may then predict and quantify the impact that events described by clustered event items will have on the domain-specific topic.

The drops ejected in the presence of the magnetic field have their velocities reduced from an initial velocity at which they are ejected. The reduced velocity increases a time in flight of the drops before they impact their landing areas. The increased travel time enables the melted metal drops to oxidize sufficiently that they bond less tightly than the drops ejected without passing through the magnetic field. Thus, the apparatus can form metal support structures that adhere less tightly to part portions of an object.SELECTED DRAWING: Figure 2",XEROX CORP,DOUGLAS K HERRMANN;;LIU CHU-HENG;;SEEMIT PRAHARAJ;;JASON M LEFEVRE;;PAUL J MCCONVILLE;;PALGHAT S RAMESH,,https://lens.org/103-305-674-844-413,Patent Application,no,0,0,5,5,0,B22F10/22;;B22F10/40;;B22F10/30;;B22F10/85;;B22F12/00;;B22F12/90;;B33Y40/00;;B33Y50/02;;B22F2009/0892;;B22F10/22;;B33Y30/00;;B22F12/53;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y50/02;;B22F2999/00;;B22F10/40;;B22F10/43;;B22F12/90;;B33Y40/00;;B22F10/22;;B22F12/58;;B22F12/53;;B22F12/70;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y30/00;;B33Y40/00;;B29C64/209;;B29C48/00;;B22F12/53;;B22F12/70;;B22F10/22;;B22D23/003;;B22F2201/10;;B22F2202/05;;B23K37/06;;H05B6/14;;H05B6/44,B23K28/00;;B23K1/00;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y30/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The drops ejected in the presence of the magnetic field have their velocities reduced from the initial velocity at which they are ejected. The reduced velocity increases the time in flight of the drops before they impact their landing areas. The increased travel time enables the melted metal drops to oxidize sufficiently that they bond less tightly than the drops ejected without passing through the magnetic field. Thus, the apparatus can form metal support structures that adhere less tightly to the part portions of the object so they can be more easily removed after printing of the object.

The drops ejected in the presence of the magnetic field have their velocities reduced from the initial velocity at which they are ejected. The reduced velocity increases the time in flight of the drops before they impact their landing areas. The increased travel time enables the melted metal drops to oxidize sufficiently that they bond less tightly than the drops ejected without passing through the magnetic field. Thus, the apparatus can form metal support structures that adhere less tightly to the part portions of the object so they can be more easily removed after printing of the object.",XEROX CORP,HERRMANN DOUGLAS K;;LIU CHU-HENG;;PRAHARAJ SEEMIT;;LEFEVRE JASON M;;MCCONVILLE PAUL J;;RAMESH PALGHAT S,ELEM ADDITIVE LLC (2023-08-11);;ADDITIVE TECHNOLOGIES LLC (2023-10-01);;XEROX CORPORATION (2021-12-07),https://lens.org/063-995-417-282-976,Patent Application,yes,10,0,5,5,0,B22F10/22;;B22F10/40;;B22F10/30;;B22F10/85;;B22F12/00;;B22F12/90;;B33Y40/00;;B33Y50/02;;B22F2009/0892;;B22F10/22;;B33Y30/00;;B22F12/53;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y50/02;;B22F2999/00;;B22F10/40;;B22F10/43;;B22F12/90;;B33Y40/00;;B22F10/22;;B22F12/58;;B22F12/53;;B22F12/70;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y30/00;;B33Y40/00;;B29C64/209;;B29C48/00;;B22F12/53;;B22F12/70;;B22F10/22;;B22D23/003;;B22F2201/10;;B22F2202/05;;B23K37/06;;H05B6/14;;H05B6/44,B22F12/53;;B22D23/00;;B22F10/22;;B22F12/70;;B33Y10/00;;B33Y30/00;;B33Y40/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Robust estimation of temperatures inside and outside the device may be achieved using one or more absolute temperature sensors, optionally in combination with thermopile heat flux sensors. A thermopile temperature sensing system may measure a temperature gradient across two locations within the device to estimate absolute temperature at locations that are not practical using an absolute temperature sensor to measure. Using a heat flux model associated with the device, the thermopile temperature sensing system may be used to estimate a temperature associated with an object contacting an exterior surface of the device, such as a skin temperature of a user. In addition, the thermopile temperature sensing system may be used to estimate ambient air temperature. Within the device, temperature measurements from the thermopile temperature sensor may be used to compensate for sensor measurements, such as when the accuracy or reliability of the sensor varies with temperature.",APPLE INC,TADLEY WILLIAM H;;KARAKI HECTOR S;;CLEMENTS JEREMY C;;HUANG LEX H;;ZHANG LEILEI;;GOW JASON GARRET;;HAYDLEY JOHN A;;CHU XINSHENG;;S MEHRA;;TANG SHERRY;;BUCHHOLZ JOHN W;;HAN CHIN S;;D 'SOUZA CHRISTOPHER C;;RABWAY DONALD W;;CHEN ERIC;;LEE JOSHUA RACHEL;;HUANG GUOZHEN;;HUANG WANFENG;;CHOU FRANK Y;;CHEN HONGLING;;AMIN ASHISH M;;LIN JIAXIAN,,https://lens.org/146-432-663-356-846,Patent Application,no,0,0,8,14,0,G01K3/14;;G01K1/16;;G01K13/20;;G01K7/02;;G01K17/00;;A61B5/681;;A61B5/01;;G01K7/427;;H05K1/185;;A61B5/6803;;A61B2562/166;;A61B2562/0276;;H05K1/189;;H05K2201/10151;;H05K1/115,G01K7/02;;G01K7/16;;G01K13/024;;G01K13/20,,0,0,,,,PENDING
