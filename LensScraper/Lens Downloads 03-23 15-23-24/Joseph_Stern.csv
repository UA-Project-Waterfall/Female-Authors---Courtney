Each DC-to-DC converter is dedicated to a portion of the photovoltaic array and tracks the maximum power point voltage thereof. The DC-to-DC converters also boost the photovoltaic voltage and regulate a DC output current for transmission to the central DC-to-AC converter. Five distinct advantages are had over the prior art. First, efficiencies in intra-field power collection are greatly improved by transferring power at higher DC voltages. Second, the number of independent photovoltaic maximum power point trackers in the power plant can be increased, in a cost effective manner, to optimize the overall photovoltaic array energy harvest. Third, each DC-to-DC converter output “looks” like a current source at the input of the DC-to-AC converter and therefore can be easily paralleled. Fourth, the current source nature of the DC-to-DC converter outputs enables the DC-to-AC converter to operate with a minimum, fixed DC bus voltage to provide maximum DC-to-AC power conversion efficiencies. And fifth, each distributed DC-to-DC converter can isolate a faulted portion of the photovoltaic array while the remainder of the array continues producing power.",STERN MICHAEL JOSEPH;;RENEWABLE POWER CONVERSION INC,STERN MICHAEL JOSEPH,PARKER-HANNIFIN CORPORATION (2017-04-18);;PARKER INTANGIBLES LLC (2018-04-05);;RENEWABLE POWER CONVERSION INC (2017-03-15),https://lens.org/017-307-488-808-170,Granted Patent,yes,6,8,2,2,0,H02M7/5387;;Y02E10/56;;H02M1/007;;H02M7/5387;;Y02E10/56;;H02M1/007,H02J1/00;;G05F1/00,307/82;;323/222;;323/272,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The converter sinks power from an external DC current source and steers that current directly into two phases of a three-phase load by using complementary semiconductor switches in disparate half-bridges of a six-pole bridge. The steering switch selection rotates every 60° to direct current into the two phases with the largest voltage differential at any given time. The remaining half-bridge acts as a high-frequency, bi-directional current source to balance the three-phase load currents. This topology and control method significantly reduces power conversion losses. The converter may also include an additional power processing stage that is used to convert an external DC voltage source to a DC current source before the three-phase conversion takes place. Prior art converters first convert “soft” DC sources to voltage sources and then to AC current sources. The invention eliminates the need for large PWM filter inductors and DC bus capacitors used in prior art converters. In addition, 90% of the power being converted is directly processed by steering current into the AC three-phase load without high frequency chopping or switching. The invention is optimized for photovoltaic, utility-grid-interactive applications.",STERN MICHAEL JOSEPH,STERN MICHAEL JOSEPH,PARKER-HANNIFIN CORPORATION (2017-04-18);;PARKER INTANGIBLES LLC (2018-04-05);;RENEWABLE POWER CONVERSION INC (2017-03-15),https://lens.org/055-974-081-096-623,Patent Application,yes,16,16,2,2,0,H02M7/5395;;Y02E10/56;;Y02B70/10;;H02M1/0048;;H02M7/5395;;Y02E10/56;;Y02B70/10;;H02M1/0048,H02M7/5387,363/132,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

The converter sinks power from an external DC current source and steers that current directly into two phases of a three-phase load by using complementary semiconductor switches in disparate half-bridges of a six-pole bridge. The steering switch selection rotates every 60° to direct current into the two phases with the largest voltage differential at any given time. The remaining half-bridge acts as a high-frequency, bi-directional current source to balance the three-phase load currents. This topology and control method significantly reduces power conversion losses. Prior art converters first convert “soft” DC sources to voltage sources and then to AC current sources. The invention eliminates the need for large filter inductors and DC bus capacitors used in prior art converters.

The projectors have cooperating masks which project onto the object illuminated patterns that subdivide the object into predetermined sections. Each mask has a predetermined pattern of sections, and is applied in sequence. The masks are cooperatively advanced in the projectors, with a separate illuminating pattern prevailing on the object each time that the masks are advanced. The combinations of the patterns on the masks define closely-spaced sections subdividing the object. The patterns are coded so that each section is uniquely defined in coded form. Cameras having the entire object within their field of view, photograph the object each time a separate mask is applied. To sense sections of the surface independent of the reflectance characteristics of the surface, the projectors direct two separate illuminating signals at the object surface. The two illuminating signals are inversely related to each other, and after they are recorded by the cameras, the recorded signals are subtracted from each other to result in a waveform having points at which the subtraction yields zero values. These points are then used to define the projection field.",SOLID PHOTO,DIMATTEO PAUL L;;ROSS JOSEPH A;;STERN HOWARD K,ROBOTIC VISION SYSTEMS INC (1981-07-31),https://lens.org/174-688-464-489-499,Granted Patent,yes,3,19,1,22,0,G01B11/245;;G01B11/2536;;G01C11/02;;G01C11/02;;G01B11/2536;;G01B11/245,G01B11/245;;G01B11/25;;G01C11/02,356/376,1,1,111-842-700-427-511,10.1109/proc.1972.8726,"Will et al., ""Grid Coding: A Novel Technique for Image Processing"", Proc.

A gas stream is then withdrawn from the incinerator, which contains the or each sulphur oxide. The sulphur oxide containing gas stream is then directed to an absorber (12) having an absorbent bed adapted to remove sulphur compounds. The absorbent bed is then contacted with a hydrogen and/or hydrocarbon containing stream to regenerate said absorbent bed by reducing the sulphur compounds absorbed in said absorbent bed to hydrogen sulphide and/or sulphur dioxide, and thereby forming off gas stream containing hydrogen sulphide and/or sulphur dioxide. Finally, sulphur is recovered from said hydrogen sulphide and/or sulphur dioxide bearing stream. The sulphur can be recovered by a Claus sulphur recovery process (16).

Oxidized tail-gas is directed into an absorber where a solid absorbent absorbs substantially all the sulfur oxides thereon. After allowing sufficient time for a desired amount of sulfur oxides to be absorbed, absorption is ceased. Next, the solid absorbent containing the absorbed sulfur oxides is contacted with a reducing gas so as to release an off gas containing hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide. Upon releasing sulfur from the solid absorbent, the solid absorbent is regenerated and redirected into the absorber.

The cover includes a mirror travel stop (116) to protect the mirror against shock. A VCSEL mounted to the wafer cover produces a beam which is shaped and deflected by a diffractive optical element (22,24) onto the oscillating mirror. The reflected beam passes out of the module toward an indicia to be read. Large numbers of such devices may be fabricated relatively cheaply using wafer-scale processing and assembly technology. Three large wafers (1100,1102,1104) are fabricated corresponding respectively to arrays of substrates, frames and covers. The large wafers are bonded together in a sandwich arrangement, and are then diced to produce the individual scan modules. The modules may provide either one-dimensional or two-dimensional scanning.",SYMBOL TECHNOLOGIES INC,STERN MIKLOS;;KATZ JOSEPH;;CAMPANELLI JOSEPH;;DVORKIS PAUL;;METLITSKY BORIS;;GUREVICH VLADIMIR;;KRICHEVER MARK;;MCGLYNN DANIEL R,,https://lens.org/033-690-019-335-555,Patent Application,yes,0,53,9,45,0,G06K7/10574;;G06K7/10643;;G06K7/10722;;G06K7/10742;;G06K7/10811;;H01S5/423;;G06K7/10742;;G06K7/10811;;G06K7/10643;;G06K7/10574;;H01S5/423;;G06K7/10722,G06K7/10;;H01S5/183;;H01S5/42,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The laser diode may be mounted directly on an Si substrate which is adapted for movement to produce a scan pattern. A collimating lens may be directly mounted on the emitting surface of the laser. A plurality of lasers may be mounted on the substrate and operated in sequence without movement of the substrate to produce the effect of a scan. The scanning device emits visible or invisible light towards a target such as a bar code and a detector (mounted on the same or an adjacent substrate) senses the light reflected by the target to produce data which is decoded for further processing. A VCSEL uses low current and emits light from a relatively large area so that a relatively large amount of light is emitted for relatively small heat generation.,SYMBOL TECHNOLOGIES INC,STERN MIKLOS;;KATZ JOSEPH;;CAMPANELLI JOSEPH;;DVORKIS PAUL;;METLITSKY BORIS;;GUREVICH VLADIMIR;;KRICHEVER MARK;;MCGLYNN DANIEL R,,https://lens.org/175-336-532-204-713,Granted Patent,yes,8,68,9,45,0,G06K7/10574;;G06K7/10643;;G06K7/10722;;G06K7/10742;;G06K7/10811;;H01S5/423;;G06K7/10742;;G06K7/10811;;G06K7/10643;;G06K7/10574;;H01S5/423;;G06K7/10722,G06K7/10;;H01S5/183;;H01S5/42,235/462.35;;235/462.42,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A process and system is disclosed for removing sulfur from tail-gas emitted from a Claus sulfur recovery process. First, the tail-gas is oxidized so as to convert sulfur therein to sulfur oxides. Oxidized tail-gas is directed into an absorber where a solid absorbent absorbs substantially all the sulfur oxides thereon. After allowing sufficient time for a desired amount of sulfur oxides to be absorbed, absorption is ceased. Next, the solid absorbent containing the absorbed sulfur oxides is contacted with a reducing gas so as to release an off gas containing hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide. Upon releasing sulfur from the solid absorbent, the solid absorbent is regenerated and redirected into the absorber. Sulfur in the off gas emitted by regeneration is concentrated to an extent sufficient for use within a Claus sulfur recovery process for conversion to elemental sulfur. By combining this process with a Claus sulfur recovery process, sulfur dioxide emissions can be reduced to less than about two parts per million.

A combination of a MONDEX style card with the individual phone cards are used for this purpose. This electronic cash (""ecash"") ecash/phone card is inserted into the phone to activate it for billing use and serves as the basis for a cash transaction. For example, person A makes a telephone call to person B and dials a suffix after the number to indicate the transaction and the amount. For example, one could transfer money to another card or account holder from one's card by dialing their number followed by CASH#200# to transfer 200 dollars to the other account. The card is then capable of being used as a cash card to make purchases or as a phone card to make calls. A database links the identity of the caller to the cash account and the transaction appears as part of a bank statement or as part of a wireless phone bill. A user could use his wireless phone to dial an account number and transfer money by entering the amount via DTMF or by speaking the amount to an ASR application connected to the database. A user could also use the phone to make purchases via the card by just dialing a number and having an anonymous purchase made of the item. Since the user would be identified by the wireless network, the user would not have to enter any additional information about identification or credit card. The number that the user dialed could then debit the user's card directly and the item could be delivered without any need for the user to enter more information.",AT & T CORP,BANSAL PRADEEP K;;BEGEJA LEE;;DURKEE EDWARD CHAPMAN;;FARAH JEFFREY JOSEPH;;KAPADIA RAJESH;;RAMAGE JOHN GEROW;;STERN BENJAMIN J,AT&T CORP (1999-02-08),https://lens.org/095-667-559-714-373,Granted Patent,yes,6,245,4,4,0,A61F2/07;;A61F2250/0067;;A61L29/085;;A61L29/16;;A61L31/10;;A61L31/16;;A61L2300/606;;A61M25/1027;;A61M25/104;;A61M2025/105;;A61M2025/1088;;G06Q20/04;;G06Q20/108;;G06Q20/16;;G06Q20/223;;G06Q20/24;;G06Q20/26;;G06Q20/28;;G06Q20/3223;;G06Q20/325;;G06Q20/40;;G06Q20/28;;G06Q20/223;;A61F2250/0067;;A61M25/104;;A61M2025/105;;G06Q20/108;;A61L29/085;;G06Q20/40;;G06Q20/325;;A61F2/07;;G06Q20/3223;;A61L29/16;;A61L31/16;;G06Q20/16;;A61M25/1027;;G06Q20/26;;A61L31/10;;A61L2300/606;;G06Q20/04;;A61M2025/1088;;G06Q20/24,A61F2/00;;A61F2/06;;A61L29/08;;A61L29/16;;A61L31/10;;A61L31/16;;A61M29/02;;G06Q20/04;;G06Q20/10;;G06Q20/16;;G06Q20/22;;G06Q20/24;;G06Q20/26;;G06Q20/28;;G06Q20/32;;G06Q20/40;;G07F7/08,235/379;;235/380;;455/558;;705/42,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

An aperture 5535 through the drape to the wound site is created and then the applicator portion 5520 is situated over the aperture. After the backing layer 5529 is removed from the adhesive layer on the underside of the applicator portion, the applicator is sealed to the drape, and the backing layer is also removed from the applicator portion. A fluidic conduit such as a tube 5540 may then be connected to the connector 5504. The tube may also be connected to the connector before the applicator is applied to the wound site. The fluidic conduit is connected to a source of negative pressure 5534, preferably with a container suitable for containing wound exudate interposed therebetween. The negative pressure may then be applied to the wound site until the wound site progresses to a desired level of healing.",SMITH & NEPHEW INC,SEAN ALBERT;;ED ARMSTRONG;;KEN BEAUDOIN;;IAIN MICHAEL BLACKBURN;;PHIL BUSSONE;;BRENDAN CRAWFORD;;ROBERT EMMERSON;;MIKE EWASCHUK;;STEPHEN GIANELIS;;ANDREW GODDARD;;JOSEPH GORDON;;MARK GUARRAIA;;TIM JOHNSON;;DARWIN KEITH-LUCAS;;ANDREW LINTON;;DAN NELSEN;;MICHAEL SALAME;;TIM STERN;;MARK WHITE,,https://lens.org/116-229-072-234-693,Patent Application,no,7,0,37,38,0,A61M27/00;;A61F2013/00089;;A61M2205/07;;A61M1/962;;A61M1/86;;A61M1/913;;A61M1/964;;A61M1/912;;A61M1/915;;A61F13/05;;A61F2013/00238;;A61F2013/00536;;A61F2013/0057;;A61F2013/00846;;A61M2205/7518;;A61M39/20;;A61F13/0206;;A61F13/022;;A61M2205/583;;A61M1/964;;A61M1/86;;A61M1/962;;A61M1/912;;A61M1/915;;A61M1/913;;A61F13/05;;A61F2013/00238;;A61F2013/00536;;A61F2013/0057;;A61F2013/00846;;A61F13/0206;;A61F13/022;;A61M2205/7518;;A61M39/20;;A61M1/86;;A61M1/964;;A61M1/912;;A61M1/913;;A61M1/915;;A61M1/962;;A61M1/90;;A61F13/05;;A61F13/02;;A61F2013/00174;;A61F2013/0074,A61M27/00,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
