   In a first embodiment, the invention is directed to an edible product comprising a squeezable nut butter in combination with a further edible component. The component is generally another food component which is desirably eaten with peanut butter, such as jelly, banana, marshmallow filling, chocolate, bacon bits, etc. Also, a squeezable edible product can advantageously be dispensed from a tube having an applicator cap with a dispensing orifice. Preferably the squeezable product is peanut butter, optionally in combination with a further food component such as jelly. The nut butter or other edible food is sufficiently flowable to be readily squeezable, yet is viscous enough such that its application can be easily controlled. It does not flow so freely so that its placement is beyond the control or the user.

   This invention concerns an equipment supply method in which a high degree of reliability is assured and in which unscheduled visits by maintenance engineers to end users may be minimized. In a first step, the method comprises making an assessment of predicted user demand over a given time period for equipment usage. In a next step, an oversupply function is applied to the predicted user demand over the given time period to provide a safety factored predicted demand function. From the safety factored predicted demand, a number of equipment units required for supply is calculated and the equipment units supplied to the user. Equipment usage is then monitored over the given time period and if actual user demand deviates from predicted user demand during the time period, then the number of equipment units supplied to the user is modified at the next convenient opportunity.

The enclosure includes a box and a lid hinged to the box along its back edge. A top edge of the box and a bottom edge of the lid are shaped to engage and hold a resilient seal when the lid is closed. The lid may be moved between an open position and a closed position. The lid is held in the closed position by a tongue and dog fastener arrangement. One of the lid and box has a dog that projects from the front edge of the box while a resilient tongue projects from the other of the box and lid. The tongue has an opening that receives the dog when the lid is closed in order to hold the lid closed. An extension of the tongue projects past the opening and at an angle to create a space for manual engagement to pry the tongue away from the dog when it is required to open the box. A pair of hasp members, one part of the tongue and the other part of the one of the box and lid from which the dog projects, are aligned with each other when the lid is closed. The hasp members have holes that permit a lock or other retaining pin to be inserted in order to inhibit unintentional opening of the enclosure. The enclosure includes external mounting flanges to secure the enclosure to a supporting structure. The enclosure also may include internal rails integrally formed with the box for mounting electrical components.

    A method of making geospatial imagery data available to the public over a wide ranging communications network such as the internet. Geospatial images are acquired, such as by aerial photography, and are digitized. Plural images are captured, each image covering a portion of the earth surface area of interest. Each image captures at least one characteristic of the portion of the area, such as by taking images in different frequency bands. Data from all images thus obtained is loaded into a common database, loaded into a computer, and integrated to create a single resultant collectively create geospatial image stored in the computer. The integration process is performed so that a nearly seamless mosaiced image covering the entire area of interest is generated. The mosaiced image is stored in mosaic sector form.

   A squeezable nut butter, especially a squeezable peanut butter, and processes of making and using. The nut butter of the invention is readily squeezable from a container such as a tube or a squeeze bottle, thereby permitting very convenient application of the peanut butter onto bread or another vehicle for ingestion of the nut butter. The nut butter is sufficiently flowable to be readily squeezable, yet is viscous enough such that its application can be easily controlled. It does not flow so freely so that its placement is beyond the control of the user. Desirably, the nut butter of the invention possesses one or more of certain characteristics which make it ideal for a squeezable peanut butter. As indicated above, preferably the viscosity is neither so high that flow is impeded during squeezing, nor so low that the product flows uncontrollably. Moreover, the nut butter of the invention is stable against oil separation. The nut butters of the invention preferably include stabilizer, but in limited amounts. Levels of from 0.25 wt. %, more preferably from 0.5 wt. % through 1.25 wt. % are preferred.

The electronic image is transmitted from the sensors to a storage device for subsequent display and analysis. The spatial domain of the image is transformed into a two dimensional frequency domain to obtain a spectral response of the image. Frequency components of the two dimensional spectral response are then evaluated to identify the direction of the directionally specific pattern.

    A grating light valve with reduced surface charging is disclosed. Surface charging is measured by the propensity an insulating surface to accept and transport a charge. The grating light valve of the instant invention has a plurality of spaced and movable ribbons formed from Si ₃ N ₄ coupled to a substrate structure formed of SiO ₂ . A portion of the ribbons are moved to alternate between conditions for constructive and destructive interference with an incident light source having a wavelength by applying the appropriate switching voltages across the portion of ribbons and the substrate structure. When charging occurs on surfaces of the grating light valve, the switching voltages required to operate the grating light valve are shifted and diminishing the performance of the grating light valve. By drying silicon-based surfaces of the grating light valve and exposing the silicon-based surfaces of the grating light valve to a Nitrogen-rich pacify gas environment, the surfaces of the grating light valve exhibit reduced charging and consistent response to applied bias voltages. In the drying step, residual water or moisture is removed from the surfaces by elevating the temperature of the grating light valve structure in a vacuum environment. Preferably, the drying is carried at temperatures of 250 degrees Celsius or greater and at vacuum pressures of 10 ⁶ Torr or less. After the surface of the grating light valve are dried, the surfaces are exposed to the Nitrogen-rich pacifying gas environment at ambient temperature. Presumably, the Nitrogen-rich pacify gas environment blankets the silicon-based surfaces of the grating light valve with adsorbed, physisorbed, or chemi-adsorbed Nitrogen and thus reduces the propensity of those surfaces to accept water or moisture, which is believed to facilitate the charging. After the surfaces of the grating light valve are treated according to the current invention, charging of the surface remains low and stable even for several days in open air conditions.

    A method of treating silicon-based surfaces for reducing charge migration is disclosed. In accordance with the method, a silicon-based surface is treated with Nitrogen-rich pacifying gas environment, after the surface is actuated. The surface is actuated in a drying step, wherein residual water or moisture is removed from the surfaces at an elevated temperature and a reduced pressure. The method of the instant invention is particularly useful for the treatment of ribbon surfaces in grating light valve device, wherein after the ribbon surfaces are treated according to the current invention, surface charging remains low for several days, even in open air conditions.

    A grating light valve with reduced surface charging is disclosed. Surface charging is measured by the propensity an insulating surface to accept and transport a charge. The grating light valve of the instant invention has a plurality of spaced and movable ribbons formed from Si _{ 3 } N _{ 4 } coupled to a substrate structure formed of SiO _{ 2 } . A portion of the ribbons are moved to alternate between conditions for constructive and destructive interference with an incident light source having a wavelength by applying the appropriate switching voltages across the portion of ribbons and the substrate structure. When charging occurs on surfaces of the grating light valve, the switching voltages required to operate the grating light valve are shifted and diminishing the performance of the grating light valve. By drying silicon-based surfaces of the grating light valve and exposing the silicon-based surfaces of the grating light valve to a Nitrogen-rich pacify gas environment, the surfaces of the grating light valve exhibit reduced charging and consistent response to applied bias voltages. In the drying step, residual water or moisture is removed from the surfaces by elevating the temperature of the grating light valve structure in a vacuum environment. Preferably, the drying is carried at temperatures of 250 degrees Celsius or greater and at vacuum pressures of 10 ^{ 6 } Torr or less. After the surface of the grating light valve are dried, the surfaces are exposed to the Nitrogen-rich pacifying gas environment at ambient temperature. Presumably, the Nitrogen-rich pacify gas environment blankets the silicon-based surfaces of the grating light valve with adsorbed, physisorbed, or chemi-adsorbed Nitrogen and thus reduces the propensity of those surfaces to accept water or moisture, which is believed to facilitate the charging. After the surfaces of the grating light valve are treated according to the current invention, charging of the surface remains low and stable even for several days in open air conditions.

Heat removal is provided by cooling fins and at least one heat filter supported in the path of the beam so that a portion of the beam passes through the heat filter and a portion of the beam is reflected from the path toward the cooling fins. The power lens is formed by a disc of cast transparent material including several lens elements in a honeycomb pattern. Each lens element has a convex surface. At least one of the color filters is a gradient density color filter formed of a disc-shaped substrate having a planar surface including a photolithograpically etched film deposited thereon. The film forms a Gausian pattern arcuate band extending around a substantial portion of the planar surface. The band has inner and outer edges and the density of the film is greater in an area along a radius between the inner and outer edges and less along the radius at the inner and outer edges.,HIGH END SYSTEMS INC,SMITH CARROLL W;;MADDOX JEFFREY T;;DUBINOVSKIY MIKHAIL A;;STULTZ MARK A;;COGBURN CHRISTOPHER A,BARCO LIGHTING SYSTEMS INC (2008-07-17);;HIGH END SYSTEMS INC (2017-03-31);;ELECTRONIC THEATRE CONTROLS INC (2017-11-15),https://lens.org/107-473-142-811-811,Granted Patent,yes,8,81,1,1,0,F21V29/74;;F21V29/74;;F21V5/04;;F21V5/04;;F21V9/40;;F21V9/40;;F21V21/30;;F21V21/30;;F21V29/15;;F21V29/15;;F21V29/67;;F21V29/67;;F21V29/677;;F21V29/677;;F21V29/75;;F21V29/75;;F21V29/763;;F21V29/763;;F21V29/773;;F21V29/773;;F21W2131/406;;F21W2131/406,F21S8/00;;F21V5/04;;F21V9/40;;F21V21/30;;F21V29/00;;F21V29/02;;F21V29/15,362/293;;362/294;;362/333;;362/373,2,0,,,Washlight Brochure Light & Sound Design (no date).;;Washlight Brochure Vari Lite (no date).,EXPIRED

   A multiplexer/demultiplexer optical system component that is passively aligned upon assembly is disclosed. The optical system includes a lens block and a mirror-filter block. In some embodiments, optical filters are positioned and epoxyed to the mirror-filter block using a positioning tool. In some embodiments, optical filters are positioned and epoxyed on a support structure which has been etched to receive the optical filters. The mirror-filter block is a block having flat surfaces, one of which is a flat reflecting surface. The lens block is formed by injection molding and includes a barrel for holding and positioning an optical fiber, placement for a collimating lens, and placements for focusing lenses such that, when assembled, light incident on each of the focusing lenses propagates along the optical axis of the focusing lens. In some embodiments, the collimating lens and the focusing lenses are integrally formed with the lens block. In some embodiments, one or more of the collimating lens or focusing lenses are formed separately and inserted into holders integrally formed with the lens block to receive the lens. In some embodiments, the lens block includes a reflecting surfaces that directs light onto the focusing lenses. Assembly and alignment of the multiplexer/demultiplexer involves positioning a flat surface of the mirror-filter block against a receiving surface of the lens block with the filters between them and epoxying the components in place.
