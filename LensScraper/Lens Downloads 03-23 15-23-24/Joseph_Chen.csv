The modulator is particularly suitable for providing a quadrature phase-shift keyed (QPSK) data signal. The modulator includes a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) for generating a data signal in response to a clock signal operating at an associated clock frequency. Two local oscillators are provided for respectively up-converting and then down-converting the DDS data signal to provide the output signal having the desired spectral characteristics. The first local oscillator operates at a first mixing frequency, while the second local oscillator is responsive to the clock signal for providing a second mixing signal at the clock frequency. This configuration eliminates the need for a phase lock loop for the second oscillator. Additionally, a digital-to-analog converter which is coupled to the DDS operates according to the clock signal. The first mixing frequency and the clock frequency are fixed, so that the frequency agility of the modulator is provided via an adjustable data signal which is output from the DDS",GEN INSTRUMENT CORP,CHEN KEMING JOSEPH,GENERAL INSTRUMENT CORPORATION OF DELAWARE (1996-09-04);;GENERAL INSTRUMENT CORPORATION (1998-07-28),https://lens.org/025-190-314-387-47X,Granted Patent,yes,4,36,1,1,0,H04L27/2092;;H04L27/2092,H04L27/20,375/308;;455/118;;327/105,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A plausible neural network (PLANN) is an artificial neural network with weight connection given by mutual information, which has the capability of inference and learning, and yet retains many characteristics of a biological neural network. The learning algorithm is based on statistical estimation, which is faster than the gradient decent approach currently used. The network after training becomes a fuzzy/belief network; the inference and weight are exchangeable, and as a result, knowledge extraction becomes simple. PLANN performs associative memory, supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised learning and function/relation approximation in a single network architecture. This network architecture can easily be implemented by analog VLSI circuit design.

   Color processing architecture and algorithms (CPAA) for color laser printers process and handle incoming RGB image data effectively to achieve high performance, high quality image printing with low memory requirements. CPAA supports a new data structure for faster raster operation processing (ROP) for color laser printers. The CPAA architecture advantageously improves the flow of data through the processing pipeline to provide high speed at higher resolutions, e.g., at 600 and 1200 dpi. An advance quantizer using multilevel dithering flexibly reduces bits to support fast ROP and to enable fast conversion to CMYK data with only a simple look-up table (LUT) operation by a color matching module, while an adaptive filter maintains high image quality.

However, tub erase requires higher voltages to be applied to the flash memory device. In a typical design, during tub erase 10 to 12 volts is applied to the tub, source and drain, and -6V is applied to the control gate of the flash memory device. However, in the state-of-the-art CMOS processes (usually used at a power supply voltage 3.3 V and below), it is difficult to build high voltage (HV) devices to support source/drain voltages of more than 6 volts unless the process complexity is significantly increased. Therefore, the required HV devices prevent tub erase from being widely used, especially for embedded applications. In the present invention, a separate protection tub is added to the on-pitch devices close to the memory array, and all these on-pitch devices share the same protection tub. While the main cell array tub is biased at 10 to 12 volts during tub erase, an intermediate voltage, 6 volts for example, can be used to bias the protection tub, which prevents the junction breakdown of those peripheral devices. At times other than tub erase, the protection tub is biased at 0 volts. Therefore, the high voltages of 10 to 12 volts are isolated by 6 volt triple-tub CMOS devices, and it becomes feasible to embed an advanced tub-erase flash memory in a CMOS logic process.",LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES INC,CHEN CHUN;;MCPARTLAND RICHARD JOSEPH,AVAGO TECHNOLOGIES GENERAL IP (SINGAPORE) PTE.

    A method for improving the efficiency of test sequences for circuits with embedded multiple-port arrays, such as random access memory (RAM), is described. With existing test generation methods, it is a common occurrence that a resulting test sequence only utilizes a minimum number of read ports for detecting a target fault. When this type of test sequences is applied, one or more outputs of embedded RAMs may not attain known values, consequently reducing the effectiveness of the test sequences. The present invention enhances test sequences so that when they are applied, all outputs of embedded RAMs attain known values.

   A subscriber dynamically selects an Internet protocol (IP) service provider. In response to the selection, a digital subscriber line (DSL) modem establishes a switched virtual circuit (SVC) connection from the subscriber to the selected service provider across an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network. After the SVC has been established, the modem formats IP data, received from the subscriber, into ATM cells. The ATM cells are forwarded from the DSL modem, via the SVC, to a router associated with the selected service provider. The router formats the ATM cells into IP packets and forwards the IP packets to the selected service provider. Thus, the subscriber has a dynamically established connection to the selected service provider that can be used for IP traffic.

    Color processing architecture and algorithms (CPAA) for color laser printers process and handle incoming RGB image data effectively to achieve high performance, high quality image printing with low memory requirements. CPAA supports a new data structure for faster raster operation processing (ROP) for color laser printers. The CPAA architecture advantageously improves the flow of data through the processing pipeline to provide high speed at higher resolutions, e.g., at 600 and 1200 dpi. An advance quantizer using multilevel dithering flexibly reduces bits to support fast ROP and to enable fast conversion to CMYK data with only a simple look-up table (LUT) operation by a color matching module, while an adaptive filter maintains high image quality.

   A method for improving the efficiency of test sequences for circuits with embedded multiple-port arrays, such as random access memory (RAM), is described, With existing test generation methods, it is a common occurrence that a resulting test sequence only utilizes a minimum number of read ports for detecting a target fault. When this type of test sequences is applied, one or more outputs of embedded RAMs may not attain known values, consequently reducing the effectiveness of the test sequences. The present invention enhances test sequences to that when they are applied, all outputs of embedded RAMs attain known values.

The present invention discloses two implementations of LM, using single and multiple transponders per signal frequency, respectively. Layered hierarchical 8PSK (H-8PSK) is a special case of LM. By re-encoding the high-priority (HP) portion of an H-8PSK signal, LM can improve carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) of a H-8PSK signal. LM can be computer-simulated and a two-layered signal can be sequentially demodulated with a predicted CNR performance. An LM signal can be simulated using live signals for off-line processing. In addition, a signal processing apparatus can process in real time LM signals emulated from live satellite signals.",DIRECTV GROUP INC,CHEN ERNEST C;;SANTORU JOSEPH,HUGHES ELECTRONICS CORPORATION (2003-07-11),https://lens.org/089-580-421-041-656,Granted Patent,yes,113,7,15,15,0,H04L1/20;;H04L1/208;;H04L27/183;;H04L27/3488;;H04L2001/0098;;H04L27/183;;H04L1/20;;H04L2001/0098;;H04L27/3488;;H04L1/208,H04L27/00;;H04L27/18;;H04L27/34,375/295;;375/308,95,17,035-036-968-580-698;;134-738-780-792-440;;078-645-906-452-934;;087-795-716-932-419;;070-642-082-209-303;;058-127-321-688-620;;114-591-838-552-994;;062-551-721-784-82X;;020-820-717-055-420;;118-801-236-491-416;;002-232-435-724-32X;;034-310-345-926-229;;022-716-320-803-059;;120-270-159-240-534;;074-825-863-867-541;;104-816-066-269-487;;147-982-698-500-716,10.1109/icc.2001.936267;;10.1109/pacrim.2001.953569;;10.1109/ctmc.1995.502950;;10.1109/ets.2000.916511;;10.1109/icupc.1998.733033;;10.1002/j.1538-7305.1983.tb03113.x;;10.1109/49.210540;;10.1109/milcom.1995.483559;;10.1002/sat.794;;10.1109/30.234649;;10.1109/wcnc.2000.904776;;10.1049/cp:19940823;;10.1109/proc.1980.11897;;10.1109/11.598369;;10.1109/vetec.1998.686050;;10.1109/leos.2001.969110;;10.1109/30.477216,"Fang, T. et al.; ""Fourth-Power Law Clock Recovery with Prefiltering"", Proceedings of the International Conference on Communications (ICC), Geneva, May 23-26, 1993, New York, IEEE, US, vol. 3, May 23, 1993, pp. 811-815, XP010137089, ISBN:0-7803-0950-2, Section I, Introduction.;;Janssen, G.J.M; Slimane, S.B.: ""Performance of a Multiuser Detector for M-PSK Signals Based on Successive Cancellation"", ICC 2001, 2001 IEEE International Conference on Communications, Conference Record, Helsinky, Finland, Jun. 11-14, 2001, XP010552960.;;Slimane, S.B.; Janssen, G.J.M.: ""Power Optimization of M-PSK Cochannel Signals for a Narrowband Multiuser Detector"", 2001 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computer and Signal Processing, Victoria, B.C., Canada, Aug. 26-28, 2001, XP010560334.;;Soong, A.C.K.; Krzymien, W.A.: ""Performance of a Reference Symbol Assisted Multistage Successive Interference Cancelling Receiver in a Multicell CDMA Wireless System"", Conference Record, Communication Theory Mini-Conference GlobeCom '95, IEEE Singapore Nov. 13-17, 1995, XP010159490.;;Arslan, H; Molnar, K: ""Iterative Co-channel Interference Cancellation in Narrowband Mobile Radio Systems"", Emerging Technologies Symposium: Broadband, Wireless Internet Access, 2000 IEEE Apr. 10-11, 2000, Piscataway, New Jersey, US, XP010538900.;;Mazzini, Gianluca: ""Power Division Multiple Access"", Universal Personal Communications, 1998, ICUPC 1998, IEEE 1998, International Conference on Florence, Italy, Oct. 5-9, 1998, New York, NY, US, IEEE, US Oct. 5, 1998, pp. 543-546, XP010314962 ISBN: 0-7803-5106-1.;;Saleh, A.A.M. et al.: ""Adaptive Linearization of Power Amplifiers in Digital Radio Systems"", Bell System Technical Journal, American Telephone and Telegraph Co., New York, US, vol. 62, No. 4, Part 1, Apr. 1, 1983, pp. 1019-1033, XP002028354.;;Ramchandran, Kannan et al.: Multiresolution Broadcast for Digital HDTV Using Joint Source/Channel Coding, IEEE, vol. 11, No. 1, Jan. 1993, pp. 6-22.;;Meyr, Heinrich et al.; ""Digital Communication Receivers-Synchronization, Channel Estimation, and Signal Processing""; John Wiley & Sons, Inc.; 1998; pp. 212-213 and 217-218; XP 002364874.;;Meyr, Heinrich et al.; ""Digital Communication Receivers-Synchronization, Channel Estimation, and Signal Processing""; John Wiley & Sons, Inc.; 1998; pp. 610-612; XP 002364876.;;Wolcott, Ted J. et al.; ""Uplink-Noise Limited Satellite Channels""; IEEE 1995; pp. 717-721; XP-00580915.;;Seskar, Ivan et al.; ""Implementation Aspects for Successive Interface Cancellation in DS/CDMA Systems""; Wireless Networks; 1998; pp. 447-452.;;Earth Station Technology; 1986; pp. 404-412; XP-002248387.;;Chen, Ernest et al.; ""DVB-S2 Backward-Compatible Modes: A Bridge Between the Present and the Future""; International Journal of Satellite Communications and Networking; vol. 22, Issue 3, pp. 341-365; published 2004 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.;;Palicot, J., Veillard, J.; ""Possible Coding and Modulation Approaches to Improve Service Availability for Digital HDTV Satellite Broadcasting at 22 GHz""; IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics; vol. 39, Issue 3; Aug. 1993; pp. 660-667.;;U.S. Appl.

CPAA supports a new data structure for faster raster operation processing (ROP) for color laser printers. The CPAA architecture advantageously improves the flow of data through the processing pipeline to provide high speed at higher resolutions, e.g., at 600 and 1200 dpi. An advance quantizer using multilevel dithering flexibly reduces bits to support fast ROP and to enable fast conversion to CMYK data with only a simple look-up table (LUT) operation by a color matching module, while an adaptive filter maintains high image quality. <IMAGE>",SEIKO EPSON CORP,CHEN JAU-YUEN;;SHU JOSEPH,,https://lens.org/191-430-469-091-867,Granted Patent,yes,5,0,9,9,0,H04N1/6019;;H04N1/648;;H04N1/648;;H04N1/6019,G06F3/12;;G06T11/00;;G06T1/00;;G06T5/00;;G06T5/20;;H04N1/40;;H04N1/405;;H04N1/409;;H04N1/41;;H04N1/46;;H04N1/52;;H04N1/60;;H04N1/64,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    Development of an efficient and cost-effective doubled haploid production system and genetic transformation system are the prerequisite to initiate haploid breeding and genetic modification in flax respectively. Pre-culturing anthers on a high osmotic, high auxin and high mineral salt concentration for a period of time before transfer to a low osmotic, low auxin and low salt concentration significantly increased the overall efficiency of regeneration or anther efficiency than directly culturing anthers on a low osmotic, low auxin and low salt concentration medium. This culture procedure also dramatically reduced the frequency of shoot regeneration from somatic cells in anther culture. Using this procedure, a highly efficient anther culture-derived callus based transformation system was developed. The transformation efficiency of anther culture-derived callus based transformation system was four times higher than the best reported transformation efficiency using hypocotyls as the ex-plants in Agrobacterium tumefaciens based transformation system or particle bombardment based transformation system. The frequency of escape in anther culture-derived callus based transformation system was one third of that in hypocotyl-based transformation system using A. tumefaciens or one half using particle bombardment. This very high efficient transformation system will prove to be very valuable in basic research for gene discovery and practical applications in genetic engineering for improved traits.

For example, an optical metal grating is disposed on a thin metal film to couple light from broadside to the metal film as surface plasmon-polariton waves; below the metal film is located a thin insulating layer and a doped semiconductor region forming a metal-insulator-semiconductor structure. The device can be configured to operate as a reflection or transmission modulator, or as a photodetector, for example. Modulating the voltage applied to the metal-insulator-semiconductor structure modulates the carrier concentration in the semiconductor near the insulating layer, which modulates the refractive index of the semiconductor in this region, thus modulating the coupling efficiency to the surface plasmon-polaritons, thus modulating the reflectance and transmittance of the device. Modulated incident light produces a modulated photocurrent under bias which may be detected using electronics.",BERINI PIERRE SIMON JOSEPH;;CHEN CHENGKUN,BERINI PIERRE SIMON JOSEPH;;CHEN CHENGKUN,UNIVERSITY OF OTTAWA (2014-12-09),https://lens.org/075-239-461-059-263,Patent Application,yes,7,21,4,4,0,G02B6/1226;;G02B6/124;;G02F1/025;;G02F2201/302;;G02F2202/10;;G02F2203/10;;H01L31/02327;;H01L31/0236;;G02F1/0152;;H01L31/02327;;H01L31/18;;H01L31/02363;;H01L31/0236;;G02B6/34;;G02B6/26;;H01L31/02366;;H01L31/0232;;G02B6/266;;G02B6/1226;;G02B6/124;;G02F1/025;;G02F2201/302;;G02F2202/10;;G02F2203/10;;Y02E10/50;;G02F1/0152,H01L31/0232;;H01L31/18,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

This culture procedure also dramatically reduced the frequency of shoot regeneration from somatic cells in anther culture. Using this procedure, a highly efficient anther culture-derived callus based transformation system was developed. The transformation efficiency of anther culture-derived callus based transformation system was four times higher than the best reported transformation efficiency using hypocotyls as the ex-plants in Agrobacterium tumefaciens based transformation system or particle bombardment based transformation system. The frequency of escape in anther culture-derived callus based transformation system was one third of that in hypocotyl-based transformation system using A. tumefaciens or one half using particle bombardment.

Generally, the described techniques provide for signaling a semi-static configuration for demodulation reference signal (DMRS) bundling across non-uniform bundles of transmission time intervals (TTIs). A base station may transmit control signaling to a user equipment (UE) that schedules resources for DMRSs and associated data channels across the TTIs. For example, the base station may transmit a bundling configuration to the UE that may configure a bundling sequence defining an order for the bundles and a number of TTIs for each bundle. Based on the control signaling, the UE may determine a reference signal bundling pattern for receiving the DMRSs and the associated data channels, where the reference signal bundling pattern may indicate the bundling sequence.

An image of the character(s) is captured by a digital camera device and transmitted to a computer, and by using analysis software operating in the computer to which the camera image has been sent, dot shapes are identified and their positions within the captured image detected, using the similarity of dots to idealized representations of dots using a combination of covariance, correlation or color data. The position information about the detected dots is then processed to determine the distance between dots and to identify “clusters” of adjacent dots in groups of dots close to one another, and to enable such clusters to be mapped on to a notional x by y grid that defines the intended positions of the dots where grid elements intersect. The image is then analyzed to determine, for each intersection of the grid, whether a dot is present or not, and starting at one corner of the x by y grid, a binary number is generated corresponding to the presence or absence of a dot at each intersection. This binary number is compared with the binary number in a reference table of binary numbers referenced to information corresponding to a dot-matrix printed character, and an output then produced corresponding to the character(s) identified. By using Reed Solomon mathematics, characters which have been misprinted can still be reliably identified.",BELL ALAN JOSEPH;;ROBINSON MARTIN;;CHEN GUANHUA;;WESSEX TECHNOLOGY OPTO ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS LTD,BELL ALAN JOSEPH;;ROBINSON MARTIN;;CHEN GUANHUA,WESSEX TECHNOLOGY OPTO-ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS LIMITED (2013-06-05),https://lens.org/112-992-279-743-034,Granted Patent,yes,10,0,7,7,0,G06V10/20;;G06V30/10;;G06V30/224;;G06V10/20;;G06V30/10,G06V30/10;;G06V10/20;;G06V30/224,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

A table look up operation is performed using the routing code as an index to a routing table. The table identifies a link (16) to use in routing the packet away from the node to a neighbor node.

   A system and method of interactive evaluation of a geometric model is provided. The method includes the steps of acquiring a haptic device position and orientation with respect to a surface of the geometric model and mapping the haptic device position and orientation into a geometric model coordinate reference system. The method also includes the steps of determining a closest point position and orientation on the surface of the geometric model to the haptic device position and extracting a surface property at the closest point position and orientation. The method further includes the steps of determining a stick-to-surface force and a property feedback force using the surface property at the closet point position and orientation and applying the stick-to-surface force and property feedback force to control a location and force output of the haptic device.

An image of the character(s) is captured by a digital camera device and transmitted to a computer, and by using analysis software operating in the computer to which the camera image has been sent, dot shapes are identified and their positions within the captured image detected, using the similarity of dots to idealised representations of dots using a combination of covariance, correlation or colour data. The position information about the detected dots is then processed to determine the distance between dots and to identify “clusters” of adjacent dots in groups of dots close to one another, and to enable such clusters to be mapped on to a notional x by y grid that defines the intended positions of the dots where grid elements intersect. The image is then analysed to determine, for each intersection of the grid, whether a dot is present or not, and starting at one corner of the x by y grid, a binary number is generated corresponding to the presence or absence of a dot at each intersection. This binary number is compared with the binary number in a reference table of binary numbers referenced to information corresponding to a dot-matrix printed character, and an output then produced corresponding to the character(s) identified.

The node where a packet leaves the constellation is a terminal node. Each packet includes a routing code (100). When a node receives a packet, it examines the routing code to determine if that node might be the packet's terminal node. A table look up operation is performed using the routing code as an index to a routing table (54). The table identifies a link (16) to use in routing the packet away from the node to a neighbor node. The packet is also examined to verify compatibility between packet type and a selected link. When a node concludes that it might be a terminal node for a packet, it evaluates a channel identifier (102) to determine if it is currently serving the party to whom the packet is directed. <IMAGE>",MOTOROLA INC,WANG THERESA CHEN YEN;;LEOPOLD RAYMOND JOSEPH,,https://lens.org/028-368-859-257-944,Granted Patent,yes,3,0,12,12,0,H04B7/185;;H04B7/1856;;H04L45/00;;H04L45/00;;H04B7/1856;;H04B7/185,H04B7/15;;H04B7/185;;H04L12/56,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

When a node receives a packet, it examines the routing code to determine if that node might be the packet's terminal node. A table look up operation is performed using the routing code as an index to a routing table (54). The table identifies a link (16) to use in routing the packet away from the node to a neighbor node. The packet is also examined to verify compatibility between packet type and a selected link.
