A threaded collar pushes a movable jaw along the threaded rod toward the stationary gripping jaw by turning the collar clockwise. The movable collar has a cylindrical dome which covers the threaded rod and the end cap. An interior sleeve secured to the threaded collar at one end by an interior ring has a ridge at the other end of the interior sleeve which pulls the movable jaw away from the stationary jaw by turning the collar counter-clockwise to release the jaws. The ball on one end of the clamp is inserted in an existing float and lock ball system attached to a stabilizing post on an operating table bed.

The distal end of the hollow tubular needle body is provided with an axially oblique sharp cutting edge terminating in a pointed tip to facilitate skin penetration. A hollow tubular needle body is of racetrack cross-section, formed by opposed parallel straight walls joined at opposite ends to respective arcuate walls. Laterally projecting ribs provided within the hollow tubular needle body at the juncture between one arcuate wall and the opposed, parallel straight walls support a thin flexible strip formed guillotine cutting blade, having a lateral width less than the distance between the opposed parallel straight body walls facing the one arcuate wall for longitudinal sliding movement toward and away from the needle body distal end. The blade width is in excess of the width of the distal end opening, and the blade terminates in a transverse arcuate leading edge conforming to the arcuate shape of the hollow tubular needle body distal end arcuate wall with which it contacts, to insure sealing of the blade as it traverses across the distal end opening parallel to the oblique distal end cutting edge and to effect complete severence of tissue within the bore. The racetrack configuration of the needle body permits orientation of the needle while insuring severence of a full section of biopsy tissue at the very tip of the needle.",BOOKWALTER JOHN R,BOOKWALTER JOHN R,,https://lens.org/113-630-261-700-202,Granted Patent,yes,3,164,1,1,0,A61B10/0266;;A61B2017/32004;;A61B10/0266;;A61B2017/32004,A61B10/00;;A61B10/02;;A61B17/32,128/754;;606/184;;606/185,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Rulon (TM) rods are inserted in slots around the opening. The rods are secured permanently in the slots and the rods protrude into the opening evenly at six points spaced around the opening. The Rulon (TM) rods provide a tight-fitting restraint on the bar, but because of the slidability along the surface of the rods, the post may be moved manually up or down with a minor effort. The tight sliding fit maintains the post rigidly in place without moving up or down or twisting once the bar is in a set position. Motion is only possible in a vertical direction.

A screw through a back panel engages a large rectangular nut fitted with angled protruding blocks on each side of the nut. The nut protruding blocks fit into the angled slots of the side panels. The bolt is rotataly fixed at one end so turning it moves the nut forward and backward along the screw. When the bolt is turned and the nut moves horizontally on the bolt, the side panels move up and down.

    A three-dimensional tilt ratchet mechanism that is able to rotate, pivot, and bend forwards or backwards with ease is provided. The mechanism includes a device for multi-dimensional movement and placement of a retractor blade which comprises a first member adapted to receive a stem of a retractor blade. The first member has a locking mechanism effective to enable selective lateral adjustment of the retractor blade relative to the first member. Also provided is a second member to which the first member is mated. The first member is vertically pivotable with respect to the second member to enable selective vertical pivoting adjustment of the retractor blade relative to the second member. A rotator indexing body is mated to the second member and is adapted to mount onto a rim of a surgical support. The second member is rotatable with respect to the rotator indexing body such that the first member, the second member and the retractor blade are able to selectively rotate about the longitudinal axis of the rotator indexing body.

    A retractor systems includes a retractor blade with a blade portion and a handle portion that fit together in a modular way to allow different blades to be removably and interchangeably affixed to the handle assembly. A dovetail mounts the blade in a plane substantially transverse or perpendicular to the shaft. Preferably, the handle assembly translates within a multi-position locking mechanism to allow adjustment of the handle extension along one or more axes, while the in-plane swing of the blade about the shaft conveniently positions the tip of the blade under tissue to be retracted when bone or hard tissue may impede access along a retraction direction parallel to the axis of the shaft. The interchangeable blades may have different sizes between approximately 5 and 15 centimeters length, and are manually affixed to the handle to set the reach and scope of the retractor for a particular operation. Preferably a blade is formed of a radiolucent polymer, permitting unobstructed imaging when the retractor is occluded during surgery on a joint, or during an anterior approach to the spine. The blade may be formed with its surface dished or curved in one or more directions, or may have a lip or flare adapted for a contacting or retracting a particular tissue or structure. The surface of the blade swings down to engage muscle along a path substantially tangent to a hard tissue structure or bone from which the tissue is to be retracted.

   A retractor systems includes a retractor blade with a blade portion and a handle portion that fit together in a modular way to allow different blades to be removably and interchangeably affixed to the handle assembly. A dovetail mounts the blade in a plane substantially transverse or perpendicular to the shaft. Preferably, the handle assembly translates within a multi-position locking mechanism to allow adjustment of the handle extension along one or more axes, while the in-plane swing of the blade about the shaft conveniently positions the tip of the blade under tissue to be retracted when bone or hard tissue may impede access along a retraction direction parallel to the axis of the shaft. The interchangeable blades may have different sizes between approximately 5 and 15 centimeters length, and are manually affixed to the handle to set the reach and scope of the retractor for a particular operation. Preferably a blade is formed of a radiolucent polymer, permitting unobstructed imaging when the retractor is occluded during surgery on a joint, or during an anterior approach to the spine. The blade may be formed with its surface dished or curved in one or more directions, or may have a lip or flare adapted for contacting or retracting a particular tissue or structure. The surface of the blade swings down to engage muscle along a path substantially tangent to a hard tissue structure or bone from which the tissue is to be retracted.
