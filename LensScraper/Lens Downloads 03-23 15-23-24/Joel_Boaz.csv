The template includes a plurality of openings in a preselected configuration. Toppling toy objects may be placed on a playing surface in an upright orientation within the plurality of openings of one or more templates. After lifting the template or templates, the toppling toy objects are left standing in a spaced formation as defined by the preselected configuration. The toppling toy template may also include feet to assist in elevating the toppling toy template above the playing surface.

The method comprises digital image scanning of sequential sub-samples of porous media at progressively higher resolution to systematically identify sub-sections of interest within the original sample and then estimate properties of the porous media. The resulting properties of the porous media then can be optionally upscaled to further estimate the properties of larger volumes of the porous media such as rock facies or subterranean reservoirs. A system operable for conducting the method also is provided.",INGRAIN INC,WALLS JOEL;;DIAZ ELIZABETH;;SUHRER MICHAEL;;NUR BOAZ;;GRADER AVRAMI;;CARPIO GUSTAVO;;CAVANAUGH TIMOTHY;;GANZ MARCUS,INGRAIN INC (2013-05-07);;HALLIBURTON ENERGY SERVICES INC (2018-03-01),https://lens.org/084-120-922-614-580,Granted Patent,yes,7,17,3,3,0,G01N33/24;;G01N33/2823;;G01N15/088;;G01N23/046;;G01N23/046;;G01N15/088;;G01N33/24;;G01N33/2823,G01N23/04;;G01N15/08;;G01N23/22;;G01N33/24;;G01N33/28,,15,5,062-870-281-391-499;;036-344-531-055-939;;150-664-701-944-33X;;021-827-208-580-292;;150-426-254-854-303,10.2118/134582-ms;;10.2118/138975-ms;;10.2118/16983-pa;;10.2118/131350-ms;;10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2007.07.008,"Huang, J., ""Simultaneous Multi-channel Data Acquisition in Three Dimensions,"" printout accessed at: http://www.zeiss.de/C1256E4600307C70/EmbedTitellntern/AN-Simultaneous-Multichannel-Data-Acquisition-in-Three-Dimensions-neu/$File/AN-Simultaneous-Multichannel-Data-Acquisition-in-Three-Dimensions.pdf, Carl Zeiss, Mar. 2011, pp. 1-4.;;Sisk, C., et al., ""3D Visualization and Classification of Pore Structure and Pore Filling in Gas Shales,"" Society of Petroleum Engineers Annual Techn.
