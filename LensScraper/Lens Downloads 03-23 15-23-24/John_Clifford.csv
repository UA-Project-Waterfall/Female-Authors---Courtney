A laminated spring assembly for a vehicle suspension system in which, normally, longitudinal restraint is applied by way of one, or some only, of the spring leaves is provided with a member which prevents undue longitudinal movement of the spring if the restrained part of it breaks. The master leaf 11 of the main spring assembly 10 is pivoted at 12 to the chassis 13 and has its other end in contact with the main leaf 14a of an auxiliary leaf spring assembly 14 which is fixed to the chassis at 15. The assembly 10 passes between check straps 16 (one only shown in Fig; 1) supporting a transverse rubber-covered abutment bolt 17 which limits the rebound of the spring. The end of the leaf 14a is looped downward at 18 and the end 19 of an intermediate leaf 10a of the assembly is looped over the bolt 17 to provide detents which limit the travel of the assembly 10 if the leaf 11 breaks.

The cutting head includes a cutting tip, clean out flutes, extendable cutting blades mounted within an internal chamber of cutting head body, and means for extending the cutting blades. The extendable cutting blades project from the cutting head body radially when the reverse thread section is driven into the internal chamber of the cutting head. The reverse thread section interacts with the means for extending the cutting blades. This may include a pair of cams that are spring biased outwardly. The cams push against the backsides of the extendable cutting blades for driving them from the cutting head body when the drill device is counter rotated. The extendable blades cut a conical cavity at the distal end of a bore hole made by the cutting tip of the cutting head. After the conical cavity is produced, the drilling device is then clockwise rotated to cause the reverse threaded section being at its most distal position to return to its initial position.

March 10, 1953 [March 10, 1952], No. 6161/52. Class 83 (3) A milling machine, for producing a small internal groove in a bore, comprises a swing- able housing 18-21 and a cam 50 controlling pneumatic or hydraulic clamping means 28 for the work and the cutting and return strokes of the housing. The work, such as a connecting rod 100, is gripped by a fixed centre 27, a spring-pressed centre 24 and a centre 28 operated by a pneumatic piston 33. The piston and centres are carried on the housing 18-21 which can be moved angularly about a pivot 17 to positions determined by a spring-pressed plunger 36 and a notched plate 39. The housing is carried on a slide 13 which is mounted in dovetail slots in a base-plate 11. The base 11 also carries a camplate 16 having inclined slots 57, 58. In operation, with the housing swung away from the cutter, the handle 56 is turned, causing a part 53 of the cam 50 to enter the slot 57 and to allow a roller 51 to drop into a recess 50a, thus releasing a pneumatic switch 46. The work is then placed in position and is clamped by reverse rotation of the handle which actuates the switch 46. The operator then pulls on the handle to swing the housing so that the handle may be rotated to move a portion 55 of the cam 50 into the slot 57 and so feed the work into the cutter 70.

[Also in Division B8] An extruding apparatus dispenses batter or other viscous material through a discharge nozzle having an elongated slot, in an element 11 into a container supported on a powered conveyor 10. The container may be a pastry or other bakery product &c. Even distribution of the material is ensured by delaying the movement of the container until after delivery has commenced. The conveyer and metering pumps are driven in the forward direction by motors 12 and 13 respectively through variable transmission means 15, 31. Electronic control means may operate to stop and start the conveyer through a clutch 16 and a brake 17 or the conveyer may operate continuously and the container be held and released by a solenoid controlled lever (72), Fig. 5 (not shown). Delivery of material is started by engaging the clutch 32 which causes the shaft 33 to rotate through the free-wheel device 34 operating a dispensing pump (not shown). After a preset delivery time the clutch 32 is disengaged and the clutch 21 engaged, thereby reversing the rotation of the shaft 33 and consequently of the pump, ensuring a sharp cut off the delivery. Rotation in this sense engages the free wheel device 34 which through engagement of a dog-clutch 36, 37 causes the conveyer to be lowered, breaking strands of material which may join the material in the container to the slot.

Ltd. July 20, 1962, No. 28113/62. Headings A5K and A5R. [Also in Division G1] Apparatus for recording mandibular movements for indicating the flex ability and sensitivity of mouth opening and closing muscles comprises means to position a patient's skull and means to be secured to the patient's chin and connected to marking means for indicating relative movements of the upper and lower jaws, when the mouth is opened and closed. The patient's head is positioned by a forehead support 49 and a nose-supporting bar 54 which are adjustably but rigidly supported by a column 34 and a support 50, respectively, mounted on a base 10. A chin support member 42 is secured on the patient's chin by a band 43 and is articulated by a ball-and-socket joint 41 to a tubular member 40 which is telescopically arranged on one end of a rod 38. The rod 38 is vertically and horizontally pivoted on a ball-and-socket joint on the column 34. The rod carries a spring- loaded marking pen 39 which can be manually locked in retracted position or released to engage paper 24 disposed on a concave cylindrical surface 25 of a carriage 20. The axis of curvature of the surface passes through the pivot of the rod 38 so that as the patient opens and closes his mouth movements of the lower jaw are traced on the paper by the pen. The carriage is mounted on a threaded horizontal shaft 15 rotated by an electric motor 13 so that the carriage moves along the shaft between supporting brackets 12, 17. Switches 29, 31, 32 control the motor so that the carriage is moved continuously or intermittently as desired in either direction. Members on the carriage operate switches to cut-out the motor as the carriage approaches the limit of its movement in either direction. The base has a cut-away portion 11 to accommodate the patient's arm so that his head can be positioned laterally of the rod 38 for recording anteriorposterior movements of the lower jaw. In order that faults in the mandibular movements of the patient may be corrected an articulator comprising relatively pivotal upper and lower members 61, 62 carrying plaster casts of the patient's jaws and teeth is attached to the apparatus in place of the patient. The upper articulator member 61 is pivotal on the conical ends of adjustable screws 68 threaded in parts extending from the lower articulator member 62. A vertical rod 73 is adjustably clamped at the front of the upper member for adjusting the spacing between the members. The articulator is adjusted so that its recorded movements simulate the recorded mandibular movements of the patient. The plaster casts are then modified, e.g. by grinding to correct the movements of the articulator and such modifications may be subsequently applied to the patient.",CULLEN BROTHERS LTD,GRIFFIN CLIFFORD JOHN,,https://lens.org/039-756-335-067-30X,Granted Patent,no,0,4,1,1,0,A61C19/045,A61C19/045,A5R RDM           RDM(1);;A5R RDMB          RDMB;;G1J J2A1A         J2Z/J2A/B/C;;G1J J2C1A         J2Z/J2A/B/C,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Dressing grinding-wheels. THOMPSON GRINDER CO. Feb. 17, 1949, No. 4347/49. Class 60 A grinding-machine has a grinding-wheel 22 arranged in alignment with two spaced dressing rolls 32, 46 so that by moving the grinding wheel and the dressing rolls in a single plane relative to each other the grinding wheel may be positioned opposite either of the dressing rolls. The dressing rolls are mounted on the table 12 of a surface grinder which is the same as that described in Specification 658,306. The roll 32 is used for routine dressing until it becomes worn when the roll 46 is positioned opposite the grinding wheel by moving the table 12. This movement causes a cam on the table to open-circuit and dynamically brake the grinding wheel motor after which downfeed is manually imparted to the grinding wheel until it is in contact with the roll under pressure. The roll is now rotated by a motor 31 and further intermittent down-feed is automatically applied to the wheel by its feed mechanism until a limit switch is opened to stop the feed. At this point, the wheel is raised either manually or by coupling its feed mechanism to an electric drive and the roll 32 which is rotated by a motor 30 is brought opposite the wheel. The latter is rotated at grinding speed as it is brought into contact with this roll. When the feed limit switch is again operated, the wheel is rapidly raised clear of the roll to prevent the formation of a flat on the latter.",THOMPSON GRINDER CO,WILSON JOHN CLIFFORD,,https://lens.org/164-241-397-455-833,Granted Patent,no,0,5,1,1,0,B24B53/003;;B24B53/07,B24B53/00;;B24B53/07,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Pulse modulation and shaping circuits. STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES, Ltd. June 8, 1954, No. 16769/54. Classes 40 (5) and 40 (6). A relaxation circuit of the type described in Specification 726,496 employing a transistor 1 with feed-back from the collector 4 over series circuit 5, 6 to the emitter 3 is held normally blocked by a battery 11 which maintains the emitter negative with respect to earth over conducting diode 12. The emitter and collector are connected over resistors 8, 10 to large positive and negative batteries 7, 9. Since only a very small collector current flows, its potential is near that of battery 9 and rectifier 15 is held non-conducting. A train of regularly recurring positive pulses is applied over transformer 13 each causing the circuit to generate a positive-going pulse at the collector which is limited near the potential of battery 32 due to diode 15 conducting. It is stated that the trailing edge of the collector pulse is determined by the potential on the collector and this is varied by speech applied over transformer 18, a capacitor 17 maintaining the potential constant during the generation of the pulse. Slicing circuit. The pulse at the collector is fed to a slicing arrangement comprising a normally conducting diode 29 and blocked diodes 21, 30 so that the output terminal 27 is at the potential of battery 25. When the pulse occurs, the collector potential rises, the junction of the diodes rising until diode 30 conducts thus carrying the output terminal to this level, Fig. 2 (not shown), since diode 21 conducts as soon as the junction rises above battery 11. The duration-modulated pulses may be converted to phase-modulated pulses by differentiating transformer 23, diode 26 suppressing the leading edge of the pulse. It is stated that the delay in the occurrence of the trailing edge is due to the time taken to collect stored minority carriers. In order to increase the percentage modulation, the pulses are reduced, an opencircuited delay line being used, Fig. 4 (not shown).",STANDARD TELEPHONES CABLES LTD,PRICE JOHN CLIFFORD,,https://lens.org/003-052-050-300-276,Granted Patent,no,0,1,19,19,0,H04J3/00;;H04J3/00;;H01P7/00;;H01P7/00;;H03B19/10;;H03B19/10;;H03K3/26;;H03K3/26;;H03K5/01;;H03K5/01;;H03K7/08;;H03K7/08;;H04J3/08;;H04J3/08,H01P7/00;;H03B19/10;;H03K3/26;;H03K5/01;;H03K7/08;;H04J3/00;;H04J3/08,H3P PPSX          PPSX,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The keeper plate 27 may be replaced by an arrangement such as shown in Fig. 3 wherein a pin 16 is mounted in the brake shoe adjacent to one end thereof for axial and angular movement, the forward end of the pin having an arcuate offset head portion 17 adapted in one angular position of the pin to engage over the backing-plate 13 and in another angular position of the pin to come into alignment with a cut-away portion 21 of the shoe into which the head portion can be retracted to bring its forward face into a position flush with the front surface of the shoe. Fig. 4 shows a modification in which a resilient pad 23 is located between the backing-plate 13 and the face of the shoe. The pad is retained on the shoe by a thin steel retaining-plate 24 having curved tabs 25 which snap into notches in the rear surface of the shoe.",GIRLING LTD,PARTON CLIFFORD JOHN,,https://lens.org/194-921-820-427-547,Granted Patent,no,0,4,1,1,0,F16D65/092,F16D65/092,F2E EHB           EHB/;;F2E E1A1A1        EHB/;;F2E E1A1B         EHB/;;F2E E1A1C         EHB/;;F2E E1A1E         EHB/;;F2E E1A2D         EHB/;;F2E E1A2E         EHB/,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A semi-conductor switch for periodically discharging a storage capacitor C to a constant residual potential comprises transistors T1, T2 which are rendered conducting in succession by pulses supplied from pulse generators PG1A, PG1B so that the discharge of the capacitor commences wholly through one transistor and finishes wholly through the other. The circuit is used to develop the input signal for the analogueto-digital converter described in Specification 976,960 for use in a multiplex pulse-code modulation system. It is stated that the use of a single transistor to discharge the capacitor results in a discharge to a level dependant upon the initial value of charge and hence causing cross-talk in the multiplex system; the use of a second, or even of a second and a third transistor, ensures discharge of the capacitor to a fixed level independent of the initial charge thereon.",STANDARD TELEPHONES CABLES LTD,PRICE JOHN CLIFFORD,,https://lens.org/190-431-267-635-270,Granted Patent,no,0,0,8,10,0,G11C27/024;;H03K5/2418;;H04B14/042;;H04B14/044;;H03M1/124;;G11C27/024;;H04B14/044;;H03K5/2418;;H04B14/042;;H03M1/124,G11C27/02;;H03K5/24;;H03M1/00;;H04B14/04,H3H HAF           -;;H3H HAR           H;;H3H HAT           AT;;H3H H13D          AT;;H3H H14A          AT;;H3H H14D          AT;;H3H H3C           AT;;H3H H3F           AT;;H3H H6B           AT;;H3H H6D           AT;;H3H H7B           AT;;H3H H7F           AT;;H3H H8B           AT;;H3P PDGS          PDGS;;H3T TCAS          TCAS,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Platformmachines ; compound-lever and steelyard apparatus.-Relates to coin-controlled weighing-machines of the platform type having a pivoted scale beam, upon the bars of which one or more weights are moved automatically, the weights being locked in position when indicating the weight upon the platform, and returned automatically to their original positions when released. The scale beam comprises parallel bars 1, 2, Fig. 3, connected by a plate 3 and by a pair of plates 4, and supported by a post 7 on the frame 8. Weights 5, 6 move along the bars 1, 2 and normally occupy the positions shown in Fig. 3, the beam then being inclined so that the weights move to the end 4 by gravity. The parts connecting the beam to the platform 16, Fig. 2, comprise links 9, 10, lever 11 pivoted to the lug 12, rod 13, forked levers 14, 21, and rods 17, 19. One end of the lever 21 is connected by links 23 to the outer ends of a forked lever 24, pivoted at 25 and connected at the opposite end to a bar 26 extending upwards through the column of the machine. The bar 26 carries a spring-supported rod 29 pivotally connected at its upper end to one arm 31 of a bell-crank lever pivoted at 32 to a depending portion of the frame 8, the other arm 34 of the lever being notched to act as a toggle member with the arm 35 of a dog pivoted at 38 to the lever 27, and comprising arms 35, 36, 37. When a person steps on the platform, the bar 26, in rising, moves the arm 34 to the right, the arms 34, 35 act as toggle-levers, and the lever 27 is thereby raised, but falls again when the arm 35 has moved sufficiently to the right to disengage the arm 34. The dog returns to its normal position when the bar 26 descends. The coin-freed mechanism consists of a receptacle 40 carried by a long arm 39 connected to a short arm 41 on a shaft 42, which also carries a weighted arm 43 and an arm 44 connected by a link 45 to the lower end of an arm 46 pivoted at 47. A detent 48 pivoted at 47 carries a pin 49, which rests against, and is moved by the arm 46, and is notched to engage, and prevent upward movement of the arm 31. If a person steps on the platform and does not deposit a coin, the bar 26 is raised and the spring 30 is compressed, but the rod 29 is prevented from rising. The bar 26 is locked in the elevated position, to prevent unnecessary movement of the parts, by an arm 50 pivoted to a frame 33 at 51, also pivotally connected to the bar 26 at 52, and engaging a pivoted latch 53 which supports the bar in the elevated position until released by the coin. The releasing-mechanism comprises an arm 54 to be engaged by the arm 36 of the pivoted dog. The function of the lever 27 is to lift the scale beam by means of a bar 55 to cause the weights 5, 6 to move along the bars, the weight on the platform also tending to lift the beam by pulling downwards the plate 3. The beam is retained in the elevated position by means of a pivoted prop 56, carrying at its upper end two flat springs 58, 59, Fig. 9, and having a short arm 60 in contact with a spring- controlled pin 61, which is operated by means of an arm 62 to move the prop towards the right simultaneously with the rising of the beam, so that the beam is supported by a stud 63 resting upon the springs when the lever 27 descends. The weight 6 is locked at the outer end of the beam by a gravity catch 64 engaging the bar 55, and is liberated, to move along the bar, when the lever 27 descends. As the weight 6 moves inwards, the pressure on the springs 58, 59 is reduced until the position of balance is reached. The springs then raise the beam higher and release the locking- bar 65 to lock the weight in position. If this does not correspond with one of the ten-pound graduation marks into which the bar 2 is divided, the weight moves on to the next mark beyond, and is there locked by a tooth within the weight entering one of the notches in the bar 65. The locking- means comprises the bar 65 having its ends bent at right-angles and pivoted to the beam. A post 68 on a lever 69 pivoted at 70 normally holds the bar in a raised position, a pin 71 on the bar 26 engaging one end of the lever 69, and releasing the lever when the bar is raised by the weight of a person on the platform. The outer end of the bar 65 is still held in an elevated position by a device comprising a pivoted bell - crank lever having one arm 72, Figs. 7 and 8, extending beneath the bar 65 ; the second arm 73 carries a detent 74, projecting laterally through an opening 75 and working with a fixed detent 76, being normally on the right-hand side of, and below the fixed detent, Fig. 7. As the beam rises, the detent 74 passes over the top of the fixed detent 76, and the locking-bar 65 is released. An arm 78 on the weight 6 returns these parts to their normal positions when the weight itself returns. The scale beam is then further lifted by one of the springs 58, 59 to release the weight 5, which is normally locked at the outer end of the beam by means of a spring finger 79 held upwards against the weight by means of a rod 80, loosely connected at its lower end to the arm 72, and passing at its upper end through an opening in the bar 1. The spring 79 normally exerts a downward force on the rod 80, and tends to release the weight 5 ; but the rod is moved longitudinally to lock the weight, when the arm 73 is moved to the right by means of the rod 78 on the weight 6, and releases the weight as the beam rises. The weight 5 is locked in position on the bar 1 by means of a bar 81, supported at one end by a rod 82 extending from the bar 65, and at the opposite end by a device comprising a pivoted detent lever provided with a cam 83 upon which the bar 81 rests, and an arm 84 carrying a detent 85 projecting through one of the plates 4 and working with a fixed detent 86, being normally on the left hand side of, and below the fixed detent. Both the fixed detent, and a pivoted lever 87 bearing against pins in the arms 73, 84, in turn hold the bar 81 in the unlocked position ; but, as the beam rises, due to the weight 5 moving inwards, the detent 85 clears the fixed detent, and the bar 81 falls to lock the weight in position. The parts return to their normal positions when the person leaves the platform. The plate 8 is pivoted at 88, Figs. 1 and 3, and is self-adjusting, being provided with a balance-weight 33 The frame-plate 8 is locked in the position it occupies when a person steps upon the platform by means of a tooth on a lever 90, operated from the platform through a pin 92 on the bar 26 and a spring 91, engaging a serrated edge on a plate 89 attached to the plate 33. The lever 90 is locked in position by a lug 95 engaging the arm 94 of a bell-crank lever, the other arm 96 of which is connected by mechanism 97, 98, 99 to a pivoted lever 100. The weight 6, in returning to its normal position, engages the lever 100 and disengages the arm 94 from the lug 95 to set free the plate 33.",MCLEOD CLIFFORD JOHN,MCLEOD CLIFFORD JOHN,,https://lens.org/162-045-310-329-64X,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Surface grinders; crush dressing. THOMPSON GRINDER CO. Feb. 17, 1949, No. 4346. [Class 60] A method of dressing a grinding wheel 26, Fig. 1, by a crushing roll 24 includes the steps of pressing the wheel and roll against each other, driving the wheel and roll at the same peripheral speed, and intermittently feeding the wheel and roll relatively towards each other during continued rotation of the wheel and roll and for a complete dressing cycle. The grinding wheel and the crushing roll may rotate in opposite directions The crush-dressing mechanism 22 is mounted on a table 12 adapted to be reciprocated, preferably by fluid-pressure means, under the grinding wheel 26 of a surface grinder. The wheel head 18 is horizontally adjustable, also preferably by fluid-pressure means, on a saddle 16 which can be vertically adjusted by a screw and nut mechanism connected to a shaft 34, Fig. 2. This shaft can be engaged by a manually-operated clutch 36 with a sleeve 32 fixedly carrying, a hand wheel 28 and two ratchet wheels 52, 68. The pawls for the latter act in opposite directions and are mounted on gear sectors 46, 64, the gear sector 46 being in direct engagement with a plunger 42, while the sector,64 is engaged with a plunger 44 through a gear train 62 60, 48. The wheel head is lowered by increments during crush dressing by reciprocating the plunger 42 with pressure fluid under the control of a solenoidoperated valve, the solenoid being intermittently energized by a cam-operated switch driven from a variable-speed motor. The increments of feed are determined by an adjustable stop which limits the movement of the sector 46. Movement of the plunger 44, also by pressure fluid, raises the wheel head. The latter is also under the control of the handwheel 28 which is graduated and provided with a fine-feed device in the form of a reduction gear 72 connected to a hand control 70. The depth of feed is predetermined by a cam member 76 adjustable around the periphery of the hand wheel 28 by a toothed shoe and pinion rotated by a lever 86 which is locked in the adjusted position. This cam member engages a plunger 78 when dressing is complete to open a limit switch LS1 which stops the drive for the cam-operated switch. The wheel head motor is stopped when the grinding wheel is positioned over the crushing roll by a cam 153, Fig. 1, mounted on the table 12 to operate a switch which open circuits the motor and brakes it dynamically. The crushing roll is mounted on a bed 108, Fig. 7, pivotally supported at 106 on a base 100 which is adjustably mounted on the table 12 and is driven by a motor 110 also under the control of the switch LS1. The free end of the bed 108 is supported by two eccentrics on a shaft which can be rotated by a hand-operated worm drive 128 to vary the height of the crushing roller. A bolt 132 is provided to lock the bed at the required height and locking means are also provided for the worm drive. In a modification, feed is imparted to the crushing roller instead of the grinding wheel by connecting the worm drive 128 to a pawl and ratchet substituted for the valve controlling the plunger 44. The bed 108 carries an adjustable stop to operate the switch LS1. A second modification employs a freely-journalled crushing roll and a slowspeed motor connected to the grinding wheel motor through an over-run clutch.",THOMPSON GRINDER CO,WILSON JOHN CLIFFORD,,https://lens.org/001-495-304-893-690,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,B24B53/07,B24B53/07,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In apparatus for detecting flames in which a detector produces an output modulated in accordance with the flicker frequency which frequencies are selected by a band-pass circuit, in order to discriminate against other flickering light sources, the change in the flicker frequency is detected by means of a frequency modulation detector. Thus (Fig. 2) infra-red radiation detector which may be a bolometeton tube or lead sulphide cell responds to the flame and a band of frequencies commonly produced by flickering flames, for example 5 to 30 cycles per second, is selected by a band-pass amplifier also containing an amplitude limiter.

The fine error signal, derived e.g. from the usual fine transmitter and receiver Mag slips is fed through a transformer 18 to a phase sensitive rectifier 18-21, the output from which is applied to a Miller integrator 23. The time constant of the integrator 23 is determined by the magnitudes of the elements 22, 24 and its output is limited by connecting its anode to the common point of two diodes 25, 26, which restrict the anode voltage excursions to the range 80-120 volts. The integrator output is applied over a potentiometer 27, 28, 29 and a resistor 30 to an amplifier 14.

At least the base region of a silicon transistor contains lithium as a dopant, in addition to the dopant which determines the conductivity type of the region. It is stated that the presence of the lithium minimizes the detrimental effect of radiation damage on the transistor's behaviour. In the preferred form an NPN silicon planar transistor is made by diffusing boron through a suitably photo-etched mask into a phosphorus-doped epitaxial layer of silicon on a silicon substrate, thus to form a P-type base region. More phosphorus is then diffused through a further mask into the barium-doped region, to form the N-type emitter. Lithium is then diffused into the reverse side of the crystal at 500‹ C. to a concentration of 10<SP>15</SP> atoms/c.c., and it is stated that this has the effect of reducing the carrier recombination rate at centres in the base region which comprise a phosphorus atom and a radiation induced vacancy or interstitial. After application of contacts the transistor is encapsulated.",STANDARD TELEPHONES CABLES LTD,PRICE JOHN CLIFFORD,,https://lens.org/095-280-941-322-980,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H01L21/00;;H01L29/00,H01L21/00;;H01L29/00,H1K KAAL          AAL;;H1K K1CX          AA;;H1K K2S1B         AA;;H1K K2S2P         AA;;H1K K2S20         AA;;H1K K2S28         AA;;H1K K3E1M         AA;;H1K K3P2Y         AA;;H1K K3P5          AA;;H1K K4C23         AA;;H1K K5A           AA;;H1K K8P           AA;;H1K K9E           AA;;H1K K9N1          AA;;H1K K9N2          AA;;H1K K9R           AA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Upper and lower seals form an oil- containing annular space therebetween. The mandrel carries a free-floating annular primary piston which sealably engages a reduced-diameter piston fitting section of the barrel when passing therethrough. The mandrel also carries a secondary cylinder assembly with a transverse top wall and a downwardly extending annular secondary cylinder beneath the primary piston, forming a piston chamber between the mandrel and secondary cylinder assembly. The mandrel also carries a spring which biases a free-floating annular secondary piston upwards into the piston chamber. A port through the top wall of the cylindrical member provides fluid communication between the annular space and the piston chamber. Thus, when the mandrel is pulled upwards the primary piston seals against the piston fitting section, oil in the annular space is compressed and forced through the port and into the piston chamber against the secondary piston to compress the spring, and the drill string is stretched. When the primary piston clears the piston fitting section, fluid moves rapidly around the primary piston, the mandrel extends, and impact faces connect to deliver a jarring stroke upwards.",ANDERSON CLIFFORD JOHN,ANDERSON CLIFFORD JOHN,,https://lens.org/090-523-828-041-417,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,3,0,E21B31/113;;E21B31/113;;E21B31/107;;E21B31/107,E21B31/107;;E21B31/113,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

NATIONAL RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. March 11, 1953 [Dec. 11, 1951], No. 29011/51. Class 40(1) [Also in Group XL(c)] In a position control system having a controlled element supplying a signal representing its instantaneous position to a mixing circuit to which is also fed a signal representing its required position the output of the mixer circuit which is a signal proportional to square root of error magnitude and of the same sign as the error, is applied together with a signal proportional to velocity of the element, to a high gain amplifier controlling the element, e.g. through a servomotor. The amplifier is saturated by low input signals and the servomotor therefore runs under full forward torque until the amplifier input becomes zero at a position midway between the initial and required positions of the element, when full reverse torque is applied to bring it to rest. The signal proportional to velocity is obtained from a tachometer generator or an equivalent signal proportional to the first derivative of error signal is produced by the anode follower circuit of Fig. 5. The square root signal is generated from the error signal in the circuit of Fig. 6 in which valves V1 1 and V1 2 are worked on non-linear parts of their characteristics to produce outputs proportional to the square roots of negative inputs while having positive input signals short circuited by diodes 6 and 7 respectively. V1 1 , fed directly with the error signal therefore gives an output only for negative error signals, while V1 2 which is fed through inverter V2 gives an output only for positive errors, which is inverted by V3 so that the input to mixer V4 changes in sign with the error. The output of V4 is inverted by V5 and amplified in variable gain amplifier V6, the output of which, together with the velocity dependent signal is fed to the servomotor controlling amplifier which saturates at low inputs. The invention may be used in the system described in Specification 750,294 in which the movable element carries a pick-up member close to a series of insulated segments to which are applied pulse signals intercollated in time. Because of capacity between the pick-up and segments a signal representing position is derived, which with signal predicting a desired position is fed to a circuit as shown in Fig. 6, the output of which is fed with a first derivative of error signal to a saturable amplifier supplying current to a coil on the element moving in a magnetic field. In this system the square root signal may be obtained by suitable shaping of the pickup member.

STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES Ltd. July 19,1963, No. 28627/63. Heading G4H. [Also in Division H4] In an analogue-to-digital converter adapted to convert a succession of values the comparator delivers a signal indicating the sense of the difference between the input value and the balance signal and there are means made effective between conversion operations for using the comparator output for eliminating any difference between the potentials on the two input terminals to the comparator. This effects a zero adjustment. The signals to be digitised are applied by gate G3, Fig. 1 to a capacitor store CS where they are held during conversion. The output of the store is amplified to form one input to the comparator D. The balance signal is derived from a resistance network RN controlled by logical circuits receiving the output of the comparator to effect the necessary switching. After a conversion the store is cleared by gate G1 and the gate G2 is opened to cause the compensating circuit CC to operate counteracting base line drift of the amplifier and any shift in the working of the comparator. As shown in Fig. 3 the comparator consists of a longtailed pair of transistors T1A, T1B receiving the input analogue signal and the balance voltage respectively. If the store voltage is higher transistor T1A conducts. Cascaded transistors T2A, T3A and T4A also conduct, the last giving an output at OP. If the balance voltage is higher transistor T1B conducts and T2B, T3B, T4B. This gives a space mark. After clearing the store a pulse J2 (Fig. 1) is applied to transistor gate G2. Both inputs to the comparator should be zero but if the balance terminal signal is greater than the analogue terminal signal transistor T4B conducts charging capacitor C during time J2. The current increases in transistor T6 until the difference is eliminated. The charge on the capacitor decays slowly, the next conversion being made while this zero adjustment is effectively correct.

Pulses of greater amplitude, resulting, for example, from two separate pulses coinciding, are reformed into two successive pulses by feeding the input pulses to a monostable amplitude discriminator which produces a delayed additional pulse when the greater pulse occurs. Input pulses are fed directly to transistor T3 of an OR gate and also to the input of a flip-flop T1, T2. The latter responds only to the greater amplitude pulses and the trailing edge of its output pulse produces a delayed pulse which is fed to the other transistor T3 of the OR gate.

C. Nov. 12, 1904, (date applied for under Patents Act, 1901]. Phonographs.-The arm connecting the soundbox with the trumpet is arranged with connexions somewhat on the pantograph principle, to cause the sound-box to describe approximately a straight line and also to preserve the plane of the sound-box and stylus always tangent to the record groove; there is further described a method of rotating the sound-box in order conveniently to insert a needle. The arm 8 is pivoted by the pin 14 to the arm 9, the joint consisting of two cylindrical boxes 11, 12, the upper of which may rotate, while the lower is fixed. The other end 19 of the tubular arm 8 is rectangular and has a hole 20 in which is inserted a short connextion 21 carrying the sound-box 24. One end 22 of this is spherical and is pivoted at 23 to the edges of the hole 20 ; the other end is connected by the rod 25 and pin 27 to a fixed pin 26 on the cylindrical box 12. If the length of this rod 25 and the position of the pins 23, 27, 14, 12 are correctly determined, the sound-box will travel approximately on a straight line, preserving its plane as stated above, as the arm 8 is rotated about the pin 14. The tubular arm 9 is capable of slight rotation about its axis, limited by a pin 18, within the sleeve 5, so that the sound-box may be turned into a convenient position for the insertion of a needle.",ENGLISH JOHN CLIFFORD,ENGLISH JOHN CLIFFORD,,https://lens.org/164-168-114-037-917,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The polystyrene sheet (23) may be roller fed (20) onto a vertically adjustable platform (11) for cutting e.g., by a laser (18) to provide at least one cut out portion of required contour according to a predetermined control program. The cut out portion is also treated with adhesive such as by a hot melt spray applicator (19) and the platform (11) is lowered to permit further feed of sheet material (23) over the underlying cut out.

This shear layer (170) forms an aerodynamic boundary for the capture flow (150) with a profile determined and optimised by appropriate injection of fluid (90). The aerodynamic boundary so generated replaces mechanically moveable solid surfaces used to vary the geometry of prior-art intakes. Use of an introduced or injected fluid (90) provides the advantages of a variable geometry, but with reduced weight and reduced mechanical complexity. In some embodiments, (15) the injection of fluid (90) has the effect of re-energising any ingested boundary layer (140), thus obviating the conventional requirement for a bleed system to provide boundary layer control.",MBDA UK LTD;;RICHARDS CLIFFORD JOHN,RICHARDS CLIFFORD JOHN,,https://lens.org/188-824-151-994-04X,Patent Application,yes,1,3,9,11,0,F02C7/042;;F02C7/057;;F02K1/30;;F02K7/10;;F02K7/16;;F02C7/042;;F02C7/057;;F02K7/16;;F02K7/10;;F02K1/30,,,0,0,,,,PENDING

METROPOLITAN-VICKERS ELECTRICAL CO., Ltd. Aug. 11, 1953 [Aug. 11, 1952], No. 20186/52. Class 38 (5). In an earth-fault protective arrangement for a winding 1 or line section, a relay 7 has an operating winding 8 energized directly from a current transformer 6 in the earth connection 3 and a restraining winding 9 energized from the winding 13 of a transformer 11, which winding is connected across current transformer 5 in the lines 2, the winding 8 having more effective turns than 9. A further winding 12 may be provided when a high neutral resistance 4 is used. On internal faults, the transformer 6 energizes the winding 8 to produce tripping, the winding 12 opposing any restraint which may be provided by the transformer 5 and winding 13. On through earthfaults, the winding 9, 13 provide adequate restraint against possible operation by spillover currents in the winding 8 due to transformer inequality. On phase-faults, no current flows in transformer 6 and, again, inequality in transformers 5 produces an overpowering effect in the restraining winding. In the T- feeder system of Fig. 2, current transformers 26 in the feeders 21, 22 and at the section ends 20 are each connected directly across operating windings 24, and restraining windings 25 are connected across a circulating-current circuit 27, 28, the operation being the same as before.",VICKERS ELECTRICAL CO LTD,RYDER CLIFFORD;;RUSHTON JOHN,,https://lens.org/023-073-032-030-75X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H02H3/305;;H02H3/286,H02H3/28;;H02H3/30,H2K KHK           HK;;H2K K321          Q;;H2K K46Y          Q;;H2K K463          Q;;H2K K480          Q;;H2K K570          Q;;H2K K595          Q;;H2K K779          Q,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

ASSOCIATED ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES Ltd. April 26, 1962 [May 17, 1961], No. 17994/61. Heading H3T. A direct coupled amplifier, Fig. 1, comprises a signal input it, a reference input rt and a capacitor C connected to the reference input to provide a reference voltage, the arrangement being such that the capacitor C is charged from the output ot1 of the amplifier during times when no input is present at the signal input. As described with reference to Figs. 2, 3, 4, the first stage of the amplifier comprises two transistors VT1, VT2, forming a longtailed pair to which the signal input it and reference capacitor C, are connected respectively. The push pull output from this first stage is limited by diodes MR1, MR2 and fed via emitter followers VT12, VT13 to a further longtailed pair comprising transistors VT3, VT4, the output from which is again limited by diode MR3 . . . MR7 and fed to emitter follower output stages VT5, VT6. During intervals in the input signal, for example during the signalling channel period in a pulse code modulation system, a pulse is applied to terminal tt, which cuts off diode MR8 allowing transistor VT11 to become conducting charging capacitor C via resistor R from the amplifier output ot1 to provide a reference input voltage for the next period of input signal. In order to ensure that the output ot1 ot2 are zero in the absence of input signals, Zener diodes MRZ1, MRZ2 are provided which effectively clamp the output to earth during zero input conditions. The outputs ot1, ot2 are fed from the amplifier to trigger a bi-stable circuit comprising crosscoupled transistors VT7, VT8, via a push-pull gate pp comprising four silicon diodes MR10 . . . MR13 which suppresses any output signal of insufficient amplitude. In order to ensure symmetrical triggering, the emitter of transistors VT7, VT8 and the cathodes of two germanium diodes MR14, MR15 are connected to a positive potential of 0À15v.",ASS ELECT IND,BARTLETT CHARLES JOHN CLIFFORD,,https://lens.org/025-958-052-305-651,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H03F1/303;;H04L25/062,H03F1/30;;H04L25/06,H3P PABAX         PABAX;;H3T TAA           TAA;;H3T TBRX          TBRX;;H3T TVX           TVX;;H3T T3V           TAA;;H3T T3V           TBRX;;H3W WVX           WVX,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A beam/wafer alignment arrangement has a laser and sensor mounted on the scanning magnet. Direct alignment of the wafer relative to the scanning magnet is determined by reflecting the beam in a specular surface on the wafer holder back to the sensor. Correct alignment of the wafer translation direction is also confirmed from any movement of the reflected light spot on the sensor as the wafer holder is translated up and down. A further sensor is mounted on the beam stop to monitor any misalignment of the process chamber to the collimator magnet, and for checking the location of the travelling Faraday.

METROPOLITAN-VICKERS ELECTRICAL CO., Ltd. April 30, 1952 [May 1, 1951], No, 10226/51. Class 38(5) In a current or voltage balance protective arrangement for a polyphase system including a star-connected winding or circuit, relay means are rendered sensitive to earth faults, as well as to phase faults, by means which apply a current or voltage derived from the neutral or earth current of the winding or circuit to each of the phases of the polyphase balance circuits to balance the components dependent on the zero component of the main current in the event of a through earth fault and to produce unbalance in the event of an internal earth fault. In Fig. 2, delta-connected current transformers CA1, CB1, CC1 associated with 'the delta-connected winding T1 of a power transformer and star-connected current transformers CA2, CB2, CC2 associated with star-connected winding T2 of the power transformer are interconnected by conductors a, b, c and n and the operating coils OC1, OC2, OC3 of a three-phase relay or of three single-phase relays, the resulting current-balance circuits being unbalanced by currents dependent on the zero component of the main currents in the event of a through earth fault. To remove this unbalance under such conditions, current transformers CNA, CNB, CNC associated with the neutral or earth conductor E are star-connected between the conductors a, b, c and n and supply currents dependent on the earth current to the balance circuits to keep them balanced. However, in the event of an internal earth fault, the currents produced in the balance circuits by the transformers CNA, CNB, CNC are not balanced by those due to the other current transformers and the relay coils OC1, OC2, OC3 are energized. The relay or relays may be restrained under through fault conditions by windings RCA1, RCA2, RCB1, RCB2, RCC1. RCC2 connected in series in the conductors a, b, c. Additional restraint coils RCNA, RCNB, RCNC may be connected in the secondary circuits of the current transformers CNA, CNB and CNC. Fig. 3 (not shown) illustrates the applications of the above arrangement to a three winding transformer. Fig. 4 shows a voltage balance arrangement for the protection of a transformer feeder, the relay operating coils OC1, OC2, OC3 at each end of the protected section being connected in series with pilot conductors P1, P2, P3, and the restraining coils RC1, RC2 and RC3 being connected between the pilot conductors and a neutral pilot conductor PN. These voltage-balance circuits are supplied from the main current transformers through auxiliary current transformers AT1, AT2 and from the transformers CNA, CNB, CNC by auxiliary transformers CT1, CT2, CT3 connected in series with the pilot conductors. Under through fault conditions the voltages applied to each pilot wire P1, P2 and P3 sum to zero, but under internal fault conditions the components derived from the transformers CNA, CNB, CNC are no longer balanced by components derived from the other transformers, so that the relay operating coils are energized. A voltage-balance arrangement applied to a tee'd transformer feeder is illustrated in Fig. 5 (not shown). In each embodiment, a moving coil D.C. relay such as that of Specification 718,815 may be used, in which case the operating coils would be connected in or to the balance circuits through full-wave dry-plate rectifiers. The various restraining windings may be wound on a summation transformer which supplies a single restraining winding on the relay through a rectifier. Reference is also made to the use of induction relays. Harmonic restraining arrangements as described in Specificaton 718,815 may also be used.",VICKERS ELECTRICAL CO LTD,RYDER CLIFFORD;;RUSHTON JOHN,,https://lens.org/116-622-796-867-761,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H02H7/045,H02H7/045,H2K KBA           BA;;H2K KHK           HK;;H2K K251          Z;;H2K K301          Z;;H2K K322          Z;;H2K K46Y          Z;;H2K K463          Z;;H2K K480          Z;;H2K K570          Z;;H2K K595          Z;;H2K K600          Z;;H2K K74Y          Z;;H2K K741          Z;;H2K K742          Z;;H2K K779          Z,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Multiplex pulse code signalling. ASSOCIATED ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES Ltd. Oct. 17, 1963 [Oct. 26, 1962], No. 40604/62. Heading H4L. In a multiplex pulse code modulation system in which to provide a bipolar pulse train binary "" 0 "" is transmitted as the absence of a pulse and binary "" 1 "" is transmitted as a pulse but with successive pulses alternating in polarity and synchronizing signals are interleaved with the p.c.m. pulses, a synchronizing pulse is distinguished from the p.c.m. pulses by being a pulse of the same polarity as the immediately preceding p.c.m. pulse. Transmitter, Fig. 1. Incoming signals are supplied to a coder CR controlled by pulses KA1 at the digit repetition frequency. If a pulse appears at the output of the coder it sets a bi-stable circuit A which applies an output via a gate G1 to a gate G2. Pulses KA2 of the same repetition frequency but delayed with respect to the pulses KA1 are supplied to the gate G2 and the next pulse KA2 will be passed via the gate G2 to reset the bi-stable circuit A. It is assumed that a bi-stable circuit B is in its "" set "" condition producing an output on lead L14 so that when bi-stable circuit A is reset the bi-stable circuit B also is reset via gate G4. Thus a pulse is passed via gate G5 and applied to terminal X of an output circuit LCA to produce a positive pulse at the output Z. The next pulse at the output of the coder again sets the bi-stable circuit A and bi-stable circuit B is set via gate G3 so that a pulse is supplied via gate G6 to terminal Y to provide a negative pulse at output Z. When a synchronizing pulse is supplied by a generator SPG it is supplied via gate G1 to the gate G2 and the next pulse KA2 is passed via gate G2. Assuming that the output pulse immediately prior to the synchronizing pulse was negative, the bi-stable circuit B will be set and the bi-stable circuit A will have remained in its reset condition. Thus the pulse from gate G2 will be passed via gate G6 to produce a negative synchronizing pulse at output Z. Receiver, Fig. 2. The input circuit LCB produces pulses at output T7 corresponding to the positive pulses and pulses of the same form at output T8 corresponding to the negative pulses received, these pulses being supplied via gate G7 and digit frequency selector DFS to control pulse generating equipment PGE. The equipment PGE provides pulses KB1, KB2 (corresponding to pulses KA1, KA2) at the terminals T12, T10 respectively, and when its local oscillator is locked with the signal from DFS it supplies a signal at terminal T11. The gate G7 also supplies the unipolar pulses from LCB to a decoder DR which supplies the decoded signals to the respective channels and produces an "" end-of-frame "" signal at terminal T16. A bi-stable circuit C is arranged so that so long as pulses are produced alternately at terminals T7 and T8 of circuit LCB neither gate G8 nor G9 produces an output signal. When a synchronizing pulse is received, the resulting pulse at terminal T7 or T8 causes gate G8 or G9 to supply a signal to gate G10. When the apparatus is in synchronism the bi-stable circuit D is in its "" set "" condition so that no output appears on lead L51 and gate 16 does not supply inhibiting signals to gates G12, G13. In this case each end-of-frame signal from terminal T16 supplied to gate G15 coincides with an inhibiting signal from gate G10, and a delay DE prevents the ""end-of-frame"" signal from coinciding with the signal from gate G10 at gate G14. If the receiver goes out of synchronism the gate G15 produces an output to reset bi-stable circuit D to inhibit the gates G12, G13 and cause the decoder to remain temporarily in its "" end-of-frame "" condition. When a synchronizing signal causes a signal to be applied to gate G14 at a time when it is also receiving inputs from gate G11 and delay DE, the bi-stable device D is returned to its "" set "" condition so that the inhibiting inputs are removed from gates G12, G13.",ASS ELECT IND,BARTLETT CHARLES JOHN CLIFFORD,,https://lens.org/097-195-333-089-616,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H04J3/0614,H04J3/06,H4M MTB1          MTB1;;H4M MTS41         MTS4,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Similarly, the line drawn by a spot of light from the same source passing through a hole (16) in the flag attached to the gripper (13) is also recorded. The point of intersection is the ideal transfer point. For transfer the e-chuck is then driven to this point which can be checked from the 2-D sensor. The gripper is then also driven to the same point and alignment can be checked using the light source and sensor. The hole (16) in the gripper flag may be somewhat smaller than the hole (18) in the e-chuck flag so that proper alignment is assured when the illuminated spot on the 2-D sensor is at the target position for the e-check but has the dimension or total brightness corresponding to the smaller hole of the gripper.

Protective cut-out arrangements; electromagnetic relays. METROPOLITAN VICKERS ELECTRICAL CO., Ltd. April 22, 1952 [May 1, 1951], No. 10224/51. Class 38(5) In a protective arrangement of the kind having relay means differentially responsive to the currents flowing into and out of a protected machine, transformer, busbar, feeder or other section of a system so as to discriminate between internal and external fault conditions, the operating and restraining coils of the relay means are connected with a common series resonant circuit for energization of the operating coil mainly in dependence on the fundamental frequency of the system and for energization of the restraining coil mainly or largely in dependence on a harmonic or harmonics of the system current. In Fig. 1, current transformers CT1, CT2 on each side of a protected transformer T supply their difference current to an auxiliary transformer ACT1 which supplies a resistor R through a series capacitance XC and inductance XL, the operating coil OC of a relay being connected across the resistance R through a rectifier SRI and the restraint coil HRC of the relay being connected across the series capacitance and inductance through a rectifier SR2 and rheostat R1. The series resonant circuit XC, XL is tuned to the fundamental frequency of the system so that it passes current of the fundamental frequency to the coil OC. During through fault and transient conditions, the harmonics in the differential current produce a voltage across the series circuit XC. XL so that the coil HRC is energized to restrain operation of the relay. The relay may be provided with an additional restraint coil TRC energized through a rectifier SR3 from an auxiliary transformer ACT2 in accordance with the circulating current of the transformers CT1, CT2 to produce further relay restraint during through fault conditions. Figs. 2 and 2A (not shown) illustrate the invention applied to the protection of three-winding transformers. As applied to the balanced-voltage protection of a feeder, Fig. 4, the resonant series circuit XL, XC is connected across a summation transformer ST, the harmonic restraining coil HRC is connected across the inductance XL and the operating coil OC is connected in series in a pilot circuit P1, P2, which is connected across the capacitance XC at each end of the protected feeder. Under through fault conditions, the harmonics produce a greater voltage across the inductances than.across the capacitances so that the relays are restrained from operation, but under internal fault conditions, the operating coils are energized by the out-ofbalance current in the capacitances XC, the restraint being insufficient to prevent operation of the relays due to the small harmonic content of the feeder current. In the feeder protective arrangement of Fig. 4A (not shown), the restraint coils HRC are connected across the resonant series circuits and load restraint coils are connected across the capacities in addition to the pilot circuit including the operating, coils. Two relays may be arranged at each end of a protected section, Fig. 5 (not shown). Fig. 3 (not shown) illustrates a busbar protective arrangement. Electromagnetic relays. A relay, Fig. 6, for use in the above arrangements comprises a potmagnet assembly 20 having a central pole 21 and a permanent magnet 22 secured to the pot by a bolt 23. A moving coil assembly 24 is axially movable in an air gap between the pole 21 and an annular pole 25, the coil assembly being mounted on a rod 26 supported by leaf springs 27, 28. A back stop 32 co-operates with the rod 26 and a contact 29 carried by the coil assembly co-operates with a fixed contact 30 carried on a spring blade 31. It is stated that the relay provides a linear response with low operating burdens.

In the form of Fig. 2A the unknown impedance signal I8 has a value increasing from zero. This current passes through R7 to 4V + line. There are two transistors, one for each output digit, connected in pairs T1, T2 and T3, T4. Initially T1 and T3 conduct so that the constant currents I1 and I2 are drawn through resistors R1 and R3. As Is increases the voltage V1 at the resistor R7 increases and voltage V2 decreases (Fig. 2B). When it equals the bias voltage B1 on transistor T1, this trigger switches to draw the current II through resistor R7. This causes V1 to decrease and V2 to increase, but with a further increase of Is it will come to equal the bias B3 on T3 so that this transistor pair switches, drawing current 12 (twice II) through the resistor R7. The transistor pair T 1, T2 then relapses until as Is increases further it sets again so that both II and 12 are drawn from resistor R7 to balanee Is. Instead of using a rising current, the oscillating signal is imposed upon the unknown sample. This overcomes the backlash of the individual stages and causes the bistables to set in their order of weight, the largest first. A four-digit system is described.",STANDARD TELEPHONES CABLES LTD,PRICE JOHN CLIFFORD;;KITAJEWSKI RYSZARD,,https://lens.org/045-310-874-887-586,Granted Patent,no,0,1,8,8,0,H03M1/368;;H03M1/0612;;H03M1/0612;;H03M1/368,H03M1/00;;H03M3/04;;H04B14/04;;H04B14/06,H3H HAF           -;;H3H HAR           H;;H3H HAT           AT+B;;H3H HBA           AT+B;;H3H HBA           H;;H3H H13D          AT+B;;H3H H14A          AT+B;;H3H H23F          AT+B;;H3H H3C           AT+B;;H3H H3D           AT+B;;H3H H3G           AT+B;;H3H H6A           AT+B;;H3H H6D           AT+B;;H3H H7B           AT+B;;H3H H7F           AT+B;;H3H H8B           AT+B,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The new design implements the concepts by placing the heel significantly lower than the ball of the foot and toes. Tests show that an inner sole reverse slope of about 31/2.degree. provides an optimum significant improvement in jumping in particular. The reverse slope is substantially flat from the center of pressure beneath the heel to the five centers of pressure beneath the ball of the foot. The flat slope provides more assurance that the weight of the user will be applied to the shoe through the centers of pressure in preference to locations under the arch. The invention is applicable to ""explosive"" movement sports such as basketball, track and field, volleyball, tennis and soccer. Preferably the shoes are constructed with formed or curved heels to retain the feet properly positioned in the shoes by preventing the feet from sliding too far back within the shoes. The increased athletic performance appears to arise from a two fold effect. First, the reverse slope because of the toe elevation additionally stretches the achilles tendon resulting in the ability to generate greater jumping force as the calf muscle contracts. Second, the reverse slope because of the continuous flat nature of the slope, provides a greater stopping or braking force, thus improving the ability to convert forward momentum into vertical or lateral motion.",SNABB; JOHN C.;;LARKINS; CLIFFORD,SNABB JOHN C;;LARKINS CLIFFORD,,https://lens.org/160-701-183-133-58X,Granted Patent,yes,10,22,1,2,0,A43B5/00;;A43B7/141;;A43B7/1415;;A43B7/142;;A43B7/1425;;A43B7/143;;A43B7/1435;;A43B7/1445;;A43B7/145;;A43B13/143;;A43B13/148;;A43B7/141;;A43B7/1425;;A43B7/1445;;A43B7/142;;A43B7/1435;;A43B5/00;;A43B13/143;;A43B7/145;;A43B7/143;;A43B7/1415;;A43B13/148,A43B5/00;;A43B13/14,36/114;;X 36 25R;;36/113;;36/127,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Pulse generating circuits. ENGLISH ELECTRIC CO., Ltd. Dec. 23, 1949 [Dec. 31, 1948], No. 33623/48. Class 40 (vi). In a high-voltage pulse generator in which a first capacitor charged from an A.C. source through a transformer is discharged through a load in series with the anode-cathode path of a discharge tube by a very heavy current pulse of some microseconds duration, the tube has a mercury pool cathode and is provided with means to discharge a second capacitor through a second anode to cathode path by a current pulse which subsists for a period of some hundreds of micro-seconds prior to the pulse discharging the first capacitor. The Figure shows a pulse generator for a radar transmitter in which the capacitative pulse forming network 10 is charged to a very high voltage periodically from the A.C. source 12 via step-up transformer 11 and is discharged periodically by a very short duration current pulse through the load 13 via the anode 14 to cathode 15 path of the mercury pool cathode discharge tube. The tube has a push-button operated igniter 16 which strikes an excitation arc to anode 18. In order to prevent the heavy current flow in the path 15, 14 when capacitor 10 is discharged from extinguishing the excitation arc a capacitor 20 which has charged from the D.C. source 21 via inductor 22 is discharged via inductor and the anode 19 to cathode 15 path of the tube just prior to the discharge of capacitor 10. The discharge current of capacitor 20 is preferably sinusoidal and capacitor 10 is discharged at the occurrence of the peak of the wave. The control electrodes 24, 25 are triggered by bias sources 33, 35 controlled by pulse generators 32, 34, respectively, the correct timing being obtained by triggering generators 32, 34 from an auxiliary A.C. source 30 coupled to source 12 via the phase-shifting network 31 and delay network 36 respectively.

In order to decrease this perceived error, the panel is addressed such that, at the transition between the two grey levels, for example between the grey levels ""3"" and ""4"", the most significant bit of the addressing scheme incorporates an analogue grey level, for example a half level. This results in a perception level exhibiting a lower absolute error in the relative grey level than would be obtained if no special measures were taken to compensate for the perceived error at the transition.

SOLUTION: Since relative gradation 3 is selected in a frame F1 and a frame F2, a visual light transmitting level through the frame F2 is a relative level. Gradation 4 is required in a rear end of the frame F2. A sub-frame corresponding to the uppermost bit is therefore addressed to white and two sub-frames in a lower side are addressed to black in the next frame 3 respectively. The visual light transmitting level is lowered from a boundary between the frames F2, F3 to come to zero in the front end of the uppermost bit of the frame 3.

[Also in Group XIX] An alignment telescope includes a casing having an eye-piece and an objective lens therein, an optical micrometer within the casing and comprising a single optical block in front of said objective lens, cell means for mounting said block for tilting movement about two orthogonal axes perpendicular to the optical axis of the telescope, two strip links engaging opposite faces of the block and extending inside through the casing and engaged at their further ends by cams supported on spindles rotatable by control knobs associated with scales indicating the displacement of an object under test in relation to the telescope axis. The telescope shown houses in front of its objective 4 a glass block 1 carried by a substantially spherical cell 2. Tension springs 5, 6 urge the block into contact with balls 8, 9, 10. Ball 9 is fixed relatively to the tube 3 and the balls 8, 10 are attached to strip links 11, 12 respectively located in passages 26, 27, Fig. 4 (not shown). At its outer end each link carries a cam follower 13, 14 maintained by the springs 5, 6 in contact with cams 15, 16 on spindles 17, 18 manually rotatable by knobs 19, 20 having scales thereon as at 22. Rotation of knob 19 tilts the block 1 about the line of centres of the balls 9, 10, while rotation of knob 20 causes tilting of the block 1 about the line of centres of the balls 8, 9. By operating the knobs 19, 20 the extent to which an object is out of alignment may be determined. The knobs are adjusted until a target, e.g. a cross-wire associated with the object appears to be imaged on a graticule in the telescope.",TAYLOR TAYLOR & HOBSON LTD,CLIFFORD THOMAS WILLIAM;;MILLS JOHN,,https://lens.org/121-574-200-044-332,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G01B11/27;;G02B23/00,G01B11/27;;G02B23/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Feb. 12, 1965, No.6168/65. Heading G4H. [Also in Division H3] With a zero input signal, the transistors 62, 66, 70 of the bi-stable stages are conducting and draw current from binary weighted constant current sources comprising transistors 63, 67, 71. A unit quantum input signal sample applied to emitter follower 73 produces current flow through resistor 60 such that 62 is cut off and 61 is turned on so that the current drawn from transistor 63 flows through resistor 60. When the input increases to two quanta, 66 turns off and 65 turns on, and the voltage at the collector of 61 is such as to cause 61 to be cut off and 62 to be turned on. An input of three quanta causes 61 to turn on again, 65 also remaining on. An input of four quanta causes 69 to switch on and draw current from 71, this being sufficient to turn off 61 and 65. For higher levels, 69 remains on with one or both of 61 and 65. The junction between resistor 60 and the collector of transistor 61, and the corresponding points in the other stages, exhibit a voltage/current characteristic which is similar to that of a tunnel diode.

MARCONI'S WIRELESS TELEGRAPH CO., Ltd. Aug. 19, 1955 [Dec. 21, 1954], No. 36872/54. Class 40 (1). In a remotely controllable switch tuning arrangement for radio equipment, of the type described in Specification 780,252, the control switches situated at the remote control point are operated by differently-apertured punched cards or the like to obtain the different tuning settings. As shown, 10a and 10b are two of a number of rotary actuators provided at the tuning equipment, each being connected in series with a battery and driving selector switches 11 and 15, 16, respectively, the arrangement being such that the switches are driven until the circuit of the motor is interrupted at the selected position determined by the setting of the control switches. The control switch for the motor 10a comprises spring-loaded plungers K0, K1, K2, connected to corresponding contacts on the switch 11, contact between the plungers and an earthed metal strip 6 being selectively determined by the insertion of a punched card, Fig. 3. The control switch for the motor 10b comprises two rows of spring- loaded plungers, LA to LD and LA<SP>1</SP> to LD<SP>1</SP>, which are connected as shown to the switches 15 and 16. The plungers LA<SP>1</SP> to LD<SP>1</SP> selectively co-operate with a common earthed metal strip and the plungers LA to LD selectively co-operate with a common unconnected strip as determined by the apertures in the punched card, and by this means ten different positions of the motor 10b may be obtained. The ten different combinations are given in a table in the Specification. As described, the plungers KO to K2 are intended to select tuning in steps of 10 Mc/s., LA to LD and LA<SP>1</SP> to LD<SP>1</SP> in steps of 1 Mc/s., and the remaining groups in steps of 100 kc/s., 10 kc/s. and 1 kc. A final plunger P would switch in a small tuning element to give ¢ kc. steps. The parts 1 and 5 of the control panel may be movable with respect to one another, e.g. hinged, so that when the apparatus is not in use the plungers 7 and contacts 6 are separated. Instead of separate punched cards a continuous tape may be used, and means provided for pulling the tape into operative position as required.",MARCONI WIRELESS TELEGRAPH CO,FEWINGS DAVID JOHN;;CLARKE CLIFFORD,,https://lens.org/199-108-294-803-898,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H03J5/146,H03J5/14,G3N NCA1          J1;;G3N NGE3A         GE3A;;G3N N251          BJ;;G3N N251          J1;;G3N N287          BJ;;G3N N287          GE3A;;G3N N287          J1;;G3N N353          J1;;H3Q QCD           QCD,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

As shown, a stream of coagulant and the wet spun yarn 5 pass out of the lower end 3 of a spinning tube through a restricted orifice 4 having a smooth rounded edge, the yarn 5 being at once drawn horizontally to one side by a godet (not shown). The stream of coagulant almost at once impinges upon a sloping plate 11, down which it flows until it reaches the lower edge 15, whence it falls into any suitable collecting means. If any filaments break, that part of the filament which is behind the break does not remain in the coagulant stream, but is picked up and carried along by the unbroken yarn. The upper surface of the plate 11 is 0.25-1 inch below the orifice 4 and the longer sides of the plate are parallel to the lateral direction of travel of the yarn from the orifice. Except along its lower edge 15, the plate is provided with a low wall 16. The plate is pivotally mounted by means of downwardly extending brackets 12 on one arm of an L-shaped member 9 and is held at the required degree of slope by means of a nut 13 and a spring washer. The L-shaped member is pivotally mounted at the end of a bracket 6 and can be fixed in any desired position by means of a locking wing-nut 10. It may be swung out of position when starting up the spinning operation. The bracket 6 is mounted on the spinning tube 3 by means of nuts and bolts 7. The apparatus may be used for wet spinning acetone solutions of cellulose acetate into aqueous acetone or aqueous diethylene glycol diacetate; acetic acid solutions of cellulose acetate into aqueous acetic acid or water, either of which may contain a high concentration of a salt such as an alkali metal acetate. Solutions of cellulose propionate or butyrate, viscose or cuprammonium solutions or solutions of polymers and copolymers of acrylonitrile, vinyl chloride and other vinyl compounds may also be spun in the apparatus.

In one example, a test instrument (50) comprises a telephone unit (60) connected to a test line (52) and two answering devices (61, 62). In response to receiving a call from a remotely located control unit, the answering device (61) connects the control unit to a port of the telephone unit (60). On receiving a signalling instruction message from the control unit, the telephone unit (60) transmits a signalling message on the test line (52). In response to receiving a call from a monitor telephone, co-located with the control unit, the answering device (62) connects the monitor telephone line to another port of the signalling unit (60), which then transmits audio signals between the answering device (62) and the test line (52). Using the control unit and monitor telephone, a test engineer can then cause the test instrument (50) to make test calls on the test line (52).",BRITISH TELECOMM,KAYES JOHN CLIFFORD;;HATTON ROBERT,,https://lens.org/111-568-516-088-16X,Patent Application,no,1,0,3,3,0,H04M3/323,H04M3/32,H4K KFF           KFF,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

    When a ferroelectric liquid crystal display (FLCD) panel is addressed in such a manner as to cause adjacent or successive pixels to display different levels of greyscale, the viewer may perceive a pseudo edge effect caused by the perceived error in the transmission level at the transition between the two grey levels. In order to decrease this perceived error, the panel is addressed such that, at the transition between the two grey levels, for example between the grey levels 3 and 4, the most significant bit of the addressing scheme incorporates an analogue grey level, for example a half level. This results in a perception level exhibiting a lower absolute error in the relative grey level than would be obtained if no special measures were taken to compensate for the perceived error at the transition. This compensation technique is applicable to addressing schemes utilizing temporal dither (TD) as well as spatial dither (SD).

TAYLOR, TAYLOR & HOBSON, Ltd. Dec. 14, 1950 [Dec. 20, 1949], No. 32562/49. Class 98 (i). A photographic camera of book-form has a centre member carrying the camera lens and two film spools enclosed in outer wing-shaped encasing members which constitute hand grips for holding the camera and are pivotally mounted on the centre member so as to be swingable in arcs about axes parallel with the axes through the film spools, the plane connecting the latter two axes being at right angles to the optical axis in both the folded and the extended positions of the encasing members. The camera shown consists of a fixed tubular-like central member 1 and two wing members 4, 5 linked thereto, Fig. 1. The centre member accommodates the taking lens 2, the view-finder 3 and a shutter, and slidable therover is a shield 6 for covering the lens 2 and the front viewfinder lens when the camera is not in use. A light-tight cover 8, Fig. 3, is hinged to the centre member 1 and is normally located between the wing members 4 and 5, which house frames 17, 17<SP>1</SP> that are hinged to the member 1 at 15 and carry supply and take-up spools 9, 10. After an exposure has been made, a gear segment 14, hinged about the centre member axis 15 and spring biased anti-clockwise has moved to such a position that an edge 18 thereof is engaged by a pin 16 on the frame 17 which is latched at 7 to wing member 4, while a pin 25 thereon engages an arm 24 of a lever 20. This arm is pivoted at 21 and spring urged anticlockwise at 22 so that an arm 23 thereof constantly engages the film on supply spool 9 carried by frame 17. At the same time, a spring-loaded lever 70, Fig. 6, pivoted at 71, has reached a position in which a pawl 72 thereon prevents movement of a pin 59 on an arm 60, which is movable by a shutter release button 50 pivoted at 57, and thus prevents double exposure. In order to move the film on; the camera is closed, causing pin 16 on frame 17 to move the segment 14 clockwise and through gearing 13, 12, 11 to rotate the takeup spool 10 on frame 171. When the segment reaches the end of its clockwise movement, the face 75 thereof disengages the latch 70 from the pin 59, and one end of a lever 76 pivoted at 77 and contacting a part 80 of the centre member 1 moves into engagement with the pin 59; also, a latch 27, pivoted at 28, engages a cam 97 on the segment to prevent anti-clockwise rotation thereof under spring action when the camera is opened. During the opening movement, a cam 42, Fig. 5, on the member 1 moves a lever 41, pivoted at 39, Fig. 4, and having an arm 40 adapted to engage a lever 35, to tension a spring 43, Fig. 5. The lever 41 engages behind a pawl 44 on a pivoted lever 46 engaging one end 48 of a lever 98, pivoted at 63 and spring biased at 64 and having the other end 49 thereof in the path of the pin 59. Also, spool 9 rotates so that a fresh length of film registers with the exposure aperture in the camera and the lever 76 frees the pin 59. When the camera has been opened, an exposure may be effected by depressing the shutter button 50 so that it engages the pin 59 and moves the lever 60 so that a pawl 66 thereon engages a tooth on a ratchet 67 and so that the end 49 of lever 98 is engaged and said lever is tilted. about its pivot 63 and rotates lever 46 so that the pawl 44 thereon releases the lever 41. Spring 43 thereupon moves this lever so that the end 40 thereof moves the lever 35 and through the engagement of this lever with a pin 37 on a shutter arm 30, pivoted at 31 and having a bent part 29 normally covering lens 2, this part 29 uncovers the lens 2 and an exposure is made. Eventually, the arm 40 rides over the lever 35 and the shutter is closed under the action of a spring. When the shutter button 50 is released, the arm 60 returns to its intial position under spring action and causes anti-clockwise rotation of the ratchet 67 so that a pin 69 on latch 27 rides over a ratchet tooth 68 and releases the latch 27 from the cam 97 on segment 14. This segment then moves under spring action into engagement with the pin 16 on frame 17 and thus frees the spring-loaded lever 70 which rotates to re-engage the pin 59 and thus prevent a further exposure. The ratchet 67 forms part of an exposure counter 65, the readings on which are visible outside the camera body. To make another exposure, the procedure described is repeated. A timed exposure can be effected by rotating a knob on the outside of the camera so that the end 93 of spring 43 rests on the cam surface 91 of a member 90 which is rotated by this knob and so that a lever 54 engages a dwell 92 in said member. The arm 54 is pivoted and engages lever 98 at 53 and has a step cam 56 which during the exposure movement of the shutter arm 30 engages the lever 41 when the shutter is still open. The shutter remains open until the release button 50 is allowed to return to its initial position whereupon the anti-clockwise movement of lever 98 rocks the lever 51 and so moves the cam 56 out of the path of the lever 41. After each exposure, the ratchet 67 is rotated through one tooth pitch by the return movement of lever 60 and when the film has been exposed, the pin 69 on latch 27 engages a dwell 11 on the ratchet so that the segment 14 remains free. At the same time, a lever 85, pivoted at 86, engages a dwell 84 on a further cam 82 so as to lie behind pin 59 and this prevents actuation of the release button 50. Hence, the camera can now be opened and closed a sufficient number of times to wind up all the film on to the spool 10. To re-load the camera, latches 7, 71 are released and the wing members opened out wide giving access to the spools 9, 10. A new spool 9 is inserted and the film threaded on to the spool 10. The camera is then closed so that latches 7, 7<SP>1</SP> re-engage. When the camera is next extended it is locked in position by a bell-crank having a pawl engaging a notch in a cam on the member 8, which is secured to wing member 5 by a sliding latch 103 integral with latch 7, Fig. 4. The counter 65 is then normally rotated so that the pin 69 lies at the end of cam dwell 81 and lever 85 has been rotated clockwise by cam 82 to release button 50. The counter is again rotated so that pin 69 again engages a ratchet tooth 68. By opening and closing the camera a number of times, each time the camera is opened releasing the shutter button 50, the leader strip of the film is wound on. When the leader strip has been fully wound on the spool 10, a cam dwell on the cam 82 allows lever 85 to re-engage pin 59 to prevent a shutter actuation. In this position, the pin 69 on latch 27 engages a cam dwell 99 on ratchet 67. The counter is then rotated one division so that the lever 85 is moved out of locking engagement with pin 59 by the cam 82. The shutter may then be actuated to take the first picture.",TAYLOR TAYLOR & HOBSON LTD,CLIFFORD THOMAS WILLIAM;;MILLS JOHN,,https://lens.org/141-015-857-383-640,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G03B19/04,G03B19/04,G2A ADA           DA;;G2A A14A1X        NS;;G2A A14A6D        NS;;G2A A14A8         NS;;G2A A14A9A        NS;;G2A A401          DA;;G2A A401          NS;;G2A A403          DA;;G2A A403          NS;;G2A A433          DA;;G2A A433          NS;;G2A A452          DA;;G2A A452          NS;;G2A A459          DA;;G2A A459          NS;;G2A A521          DA;;G2A A521          NS;;G2A A528          DA;;G2A A528          NS;;G2A A541          DA;;G2A A541          NS;;G2A A625          DA;;G2A A625          NS;;G2A A641          DA;;G2A A641          NS;;G2A A647          DA;;G2A A647          NS;;G2A A651          DA;;G2A A651          NS;;G2A A684          DA;;G2A A684          NS,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The user of the control apparatus is able to monitor the test calls. In one example, a test instrument (50) comprises a telephone unit (60) connected to a test line (52) and two answering devices (61, 62). In response to receiving a call from a remotely located control unit, the answering device (61) connects the control unit to a port of the telephone unit (60). On receiving a signalling instruction message from the control unit, the telephone unit (60) transmits a signalling message on the test line (52). In response to receiving a call from a monitor telephone, co-located with the control unit, the answering device (62) connects the monitor telephone line to another port of the signalling unit (60), which then transmits audio signals between the answering device (62) and the test line (52). Using the control unit and monitor telephone, a test engineer can then cause the test instrument (50) to make test calls on the test line (52).",BRITISH TELECOMM;;KAYES JOHN CLIFFORD;;HATTON ROBERT,KAYES JOHN CLIFFORD;;HATTON ROBERT,,https://lens.org/154-666-342-753-48X,Patent Application,yes,1,0,3,3,0,H04M3/323,H04M3/32,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The catalyst may be supported on a carrier, e.g. alumina, silica or pumice (see Division B1E). The ethylene feed may be admixed with ethane which can also form vinyl chloride under the reaction conditions. An example describes the use of a Cu/K/Ce catalyst; some vinylidene dichloride, 1,2 - dichloroethane and trichloroethylene occur in the vinyl chloride product. Reference has been directed by the Comptroller to the Specification 969,937.ALSO:Catalysts for the oxychlorination of ethylene comprise an oxide, chloride or oxychloride of copper, a chloride of an alkali and/or alkaline earth metal, an oxide, chloride or oxychloride of one or more of the rare earth metals, iron, yltrium, zirconium, uranium, - thorium or titanium and a suitable support material, e.g., alumina, silica or pumice. The catalyst preferably contains 0.5-10% Cu, 0.2-10% alkali or alkaline earth metal and 0.2-10% rare earth, Fe, Y, Zr, U, Th or Ti, based on the weight of the catalyst and support. The catalyst may be prepared by impregnating the carrier with solutions of the metal salts. The metal salts may be those which decompose or react under the oxychlorination conditions to give the oxides chlorides or oxychlorides, e.g. nitrates, hydroxides, formates, oxalates, acetates, aluminates of alkali or alkaline earth metals or certain organic-metallic compounds, e.g. butyl titanate. The preferred support is activated alumina which has been pre-heated to 900 - 1400 DEG C. An Example describes a catalyst consisting of cupric chloride/potassium chloride/cerium chloride/alumina.

The yarn may also contain a coloured pigment, for identification purposes. One or more of the yarns may be woven into surgical dressings. The barium sulphate, or the like, is added to the spinning solution as a dry powder having a particle size of less than 4 microns after the main filtration but before the solution is filtered in the spinning machine, the spinning machine filter being wadding weighing 300 gms./square metre. The solution is spun from a spinneret having holes of at least 100 microns, preferably 120 microns, to a final yarn denier of at least 3000. In an example, viscose containing 8 per cent cellulose and 6.5 per cent alkali was filtered twice through wadding and to the filtrate was added 8 per cent by weight of dry barium sulphate of particle size 1 micron. The mixture was agitated for 30 mins. with a high-speed stirrer and then de-aerated by standing for 6 hrs. under a reduced pressure of 2 lb. per sq. in. absolute. The viscose was passed through cotton wadding weighing 300 gms. per sq. metre and spun form a spinneret having 720 holes of 120 micron diameter into a bath containing 9 per cent sulphuric acid, 4 per cent magnesium sulphate, 1 per cent zinc sulphate and 18 per cent sodium sulphate. The spinning speed was 65 metres/minute and the stretch 30 per cent. After bleaching, dyeing and conditioning the final denier was 10,000 and the barium sulphate content 48 per cent. In a second example, 10 per cent of the filtered viscose solution was mixed with 42 per cent by weight of the dry barium sulphate by means of a paddle and circulation through a pipe containing a reed vibrating at supersonic frequency. The solution was then centrifuged, added to the remaining 90 per cent of the filtered viscose solution together with 0.01 per cent of the total weight of iso-octyl alcohol to prevent formation of stable froth, the whole mixed and de-aerated under reduced pressure. The mixture was spun through a spinneret having 480 holes of 120 micron diameter to give a thread of 7000 denier containing 28 per cent of barium sulphate, two of these threads after desulphurizing and drying being twisted together to form the final detector thread.

Radiolocation. MINISTER OF SUPPLY. Nov. 4, 1946, No. 32664. [Class 40 (vii)] A radar system comprises at least two aerials of the type which employ mirror reflectors, the reflectors being shaped to produce optimum response at different angles of elevation ; the aerials are rotated and fed in turn, and the received echoes appear simultaneously on one or more cathode-ray tube displays. The embodiment disclosed is an airfield-control radar and has two mirror aerials 1, 2 mounted backto-back on a housing 7 containing the transmitting and receiving equipment, and rotatable about a column 22 on a base 23. Mirror 1 is a paraboloid producing a narrow low-angle beam for long-range detection and mirror 2 a distorted paraboloid producing a high-angle beam suitable for short-range detection with the minimum of ground clutter, the combination of beams providing adequate coverage at all ranges and heights required for airfield control. The transmitter 6 feeds the mirrors alternately through branched wave-guides, each containing a ring switch 8, 9 of the type disclosed in Specification 597,216, the rings being disposed at 90 degrees to each other and rotated by a motor also driving a synchronizing wave-form generator 12 from the transmitter and displays. The generator feeds into a control unit 15 which produces negative locking pulses for the transmitter modulator to ensure that the transmitter pulses with the ring switches in the correct position, and alternate negative and positive pulses to synchronize the display time bases. Displays of the planposition type are employed and polarity discrimination in the synchronizing pulses is necessary since the aerials face in opposing directions and the time bases must be reversed. The aerials function for both transmitting and receiving and employ switching means as disclosed in Specification 583,743. A trolley supports the assembly so that the system may be moved into any desired position relatively to the airfield control tower, the supplies and signals being conveyed by line and connected through slip rings 27 and a rotary coupling 29. The displays are located in the control tower and the received echo signals pass to the displays at the intermediate frequency. A Selsyn motor 32 repeats the aerial bearing to the displays. Preferably the displays have a second rotatable time-base under the control of an independent direction-finding aerial. The second time-base is used to produce a radial trace only on receipt of signals from a transmitting aircraft so that when the second trace intersects an echo on the radar display, identification of that echo with the transmitting aircraft is achieved. The housing 7 includes an air-circulating fan 35 and drying agents 34.",MINI OF SUPPLY,DUCKWORTH JOHN CLIFFORD;;BACON GEORGE EDWARD;;CHISHOLM JOHN,,https://lens.org/091-274-267-445-05X,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,G01S13/762;;G01S1/02,G01S1/02;;G01S13/76,H1Q QAX           AX,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A radar system for generating a three-dimensional image includes a radar transmitter which is operable to produce a radar signal of a frequency of at least three gigahertz. A plurality of radar receiving antennas from an antenna array. The antenna array is aerially translatable. For example, in one embodiment, the antenna array is disposed along the wings of an aircraft which, in operation, flies over the intended target area. A three-dimensional image is generated from a reflected radar signal returned from the surface of an object in response to the transmitted radar signal. The radar system may be incorporated into an aircraft and adapted to detect subsurface objects such as mines buried beneath the surface of the ground as the aircraft traverses over a target area.

The plunger is guided by a solenoid (36) and frame (30). The plunger is spring loaded (38) such that it normally is biased into the carriage to restrain the carriage in the home locking position. The solenoid (36) can withdraw the plunger and allow release of the carriage. A counterweight (40) rotates about a pivot (50) provided on the frame adjacent the plunger. A finger (42) that protrudes from the counterweight rides in a recess on the plunger. In the event of a sudden shock to the disc drive, the shock force is transmitted from the plunger (34) through the finger (42) to the counterweight (40). The counterweight is designed to be of equal mass to the plunger (34), whereby the shock force is neutralized, preventing the plunger from moving back toward the solenoid and releasing the carriage (12).",SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY,WIENS JOHN POLING;;JUE CLIFFORD T,,https://lens.org/008-402-222-119-211,Granted Patent,no,0,0,13,13,0,G11B5/54;;G11B21/02;;G11B21/08;;G11B19/22;;G11B5/54;;G11B21/08;;G11B21/02,G11B5/40;;G11B5/54;;G11B21/02;;G11B21/08;;G11B21/22,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

R., and English, J. C. July 10, 1909, [Convention date]. Tone-arm joints; trumpets, arranging and supporting; cases.-In a talking - machine, the volume of sound is regulated by changing the angle of the horn above the machine, and both the horn and tone-arm are supported from the outside of the containing cabinet. The horn 35 is rectangular in crosssection, and the sides diverge to a greater degree than the top and bottom. It is mounted in an elbow 46 flanged at 50 for attachment to the outside of the hinged cover 2. The elbow 46 is cylindrically concave at its lower end to slide over the convex top of a bracket 21 carrying the tone-arm 17 which swings across the record on a pivot 25 supported by a spring 30 and spider 26 in the bracket 21, which is secured to the outside of the body of the cabinet. The tone - arm is secured to the pivot 25 by means of a set-screw 32 clamping the pivot within a sleeve on the tone-arm. An extension 55 on the bracket 21 and a projecting shield 49 on the elbow 46 act as closures to modify the sound when the cover is raised. The cover may be supported in various positions by a pivoted notched bar 70 and pin. The horn 35 is at all times out of contact with any part of the cabinet, and its mouth is closed wholly or partially by a hinged door 60 in the cover 2.
