Jan. 18, 1917. Regulating; valves; valves-gear.-To facilitate starting and slow running in an engine using crank chamber compression, a portion of each charge is rejected from the cylinder during the compression and stored in reservoirs d which return the rejected charges towards the ends of the working strokes. Communication between the reservoirs and the cylinder is controlled by a valve h, the point of closing of which determines the amount of charge delivered to the reservoirs. The valve carries a piston k, which is open on its upper face to a passage containing a storage chamber n communicating with the crank chamber through a hand-controlled valve p<1>. At starting, the valve p<1> is closed and a non-return valve q, which is normally held to its seat by a rod y, is left free to open, the crank chamber then charging the reservoir o through the by-pass r. The pressure in the reservoir holds the valve h in its lowermost position until it is reduced by opening the valve p<1>. After starting, the valve p' is opened more or less, and gases escape from the reservoir o to the crank casing, the pressure in the reservoir determining the pressure at which the valve p<1> is closed to cut off communication between the chambers d and the cylinder. Leakage of gas from the cylinder to the reservoir o takes place through a passage k<1> in the piston k, the leakage being balanced by the gases escaping past the valve p' into the crank casing. The valve p<1> and the rod y of the valve q are actuated by Bowden wire mechansm. The reservoir o may be charged by a separate pump and the valve h. may be held open by a screw inserted in the casing x'.",ANDERSON WILLIAM,ANDERSON WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/156-391-859-263-929,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,F02B25/00;;F02B2075/025;;F02B2700/035,F02B25/00;;F02B75/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The sta- biiiser incorporates means for simplifying the setting of the stabiliser. In one embodiment, a pointer carried by a screw-threaded nut of a pivot bolt is co-operable with a co-axial graduated and freely rotatable disc. To set the stabiliser, the nut is tightened till axial freedom is just removed, then the disc and pointer are used to measure subsequent tightening of the nut. In a second embodiment, the pointer is replaced by a second disc which engages the nut throughh a spring loaded detent which determines more consistently the nut position at which axial freedom is removed.

    A ladder removal tool designed for use with any ladder that is supported at an elevated position and the method of its use are disclosed. The ladder may be an extension ladder or a large A frame ladder. The ladder removal consists of a lifting rod that has hook connected to one end by a pivot joint that allows the hook to rotate with respect to the lifting rod. The lifting rod has a substantially right angle bend adjacent the pivot joint to aid the user in reaching up and hooking or engaging the hook with a rung of the ladder to be lowered. The opposite end of the lifting rod has a handle attached thereto. Additionally, the leg of the hook attached to the lifting rod has a stabilizer arm attached thereto. The user reaches up and inserts the hook of the tool around a rung of the ladder while simultaneously allowing the stabilizer arm to extend over and engage the side rail of the ladder. Generally, the user lifts one end of the ladder clear of the rack, swings the ladder away from the truck and lowers the ladder to the ground, while the opposite end rotates around the safety bar on the rack. The user can then use the ladder removal tool to lift the opposite end and lower it to the ground. If desired, the user may use the tool to replace the ladder on the vehicle by simply reversing the order of operation.

Each cell's base station transmits a downlink reference signal at a known transmission power level. A mobile station monitors the received signal strength of the downlink reference signals from multiple base stations. The transmitted and received signal strength levels can be used by the mobile station to estimate the amount of intercell interference that the mobile station's uplink transmissions cause, and the mobile station's uplink transmission parameters are adjusted accordingly. In further embodiments, the received reference signal power levels, or values derived therefrom, are transmitted by the mobile station to its serving base station, where a scheduling algorithm uses the information to adjust one or more transmission parameters relating to a grant of uplink transmission resources to the UE, thereby controlling the intercell interference generated by the mobile station's uplink transmissions.

   A frame surrounds a framed area. The frame has an interior side and an exterior side opposite the interior side. An object to be displayed at certain times, such as a television set, is placed within the framed area. A flexible canvas cover has an area that is greater than or equal to the framed area. A storage roll is secured to the flexible canvas cover, thereby allowing the flexible canvas cover to be rolled onto the storage roll. A roll driver mechanism is securably attached to the interior side of the frame. The roll driver mechanism rotates the storage roll, thereby moving the flexible canvas cover between a deployed position and a retracted position. In the deployed position, the flexible canvas cover covers the framed area; in the retracted position, the flexible canvas cover is rolled onto the storage roll, and is positioned adjacent to the interior side of the frame.

Difference between the two signals arising from slip is detected to derive a difference signal that is subtracted from the sum of the two signals so as to derive thereby an output in accordance with the speed of the slower, non-slipping, wheel. Alternatively, the difference signal controls switches that supply the two signals to an adder to cause both to supply the slower-wheel signal to the adder when a predetermined threshold value of the speed-difference signal is detected. The sense of the speed-difference signal may instead be used to control selection for direct use of whichever of the two wheel-speed signals is representative of the slower wheel. The two speed signals may be in the form of mechanical or electrical manifestations and in the latter case may be of pulse form supplied to respective switching inputs of a bistable device to produce an output pulse train in accordance with the lower pulse frequency. Where two wheels are driven from a common drive-shaft through a differential, detected rotation of the planet wheels of the differential (arising from slip of one driven wheel relative to the other) may be used to reduce the engine speed so as to eliminate slip and ensure correct reading of speed or distance directly from the drive-shaft rotation.",SMITHS INDUSTRIES LTD,ANDERSON EDWARD WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/146-456-523-768-562,Granted Patent,no,4,11,1,2,0,G01P3/50;;G01P3/56;;G01P3/50;;G01P3/56,G01P3/50;;G01P3/56,73/510,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The critical factor is controlling the amount of time the light is on versus amount of time it is off, and the frequency at which the lamp is pulsed on. The pulsed illumination projector device reduces the amount of backscatter from particulate matter such as water, zooplankton, dust, fog and the like which causes a significant amount of light to reflect back toward the source thereby reducing visibility. Backscatter is reduced through the reduction of direct incident light. As the backscatter is reduced, the distance which objects can be detected is increased. Illumination is controlled directly by pulse length and repetition rate.

    A truss assembly apparatus for use in assembling a truss. The apparatus has a truss table and a roller assembly movable relative to the truss table for pressing connectors into truss members. A wheel guide directs movement of the roller assembly relative to the truss table. The roller assembly automatically reduces speed when approaching an end of the wheel guide. A wear strip is removably secured to the guide so that the wear strip may be replaced with a different wear strip without replacement of the guide.

    A system, transmitter, receiver and method for communication power control by the transmitting entity ( 150 A) keeping a sequence number counter ( 200 ) per UE ( 130 A) that is incremented whenever a common channel transmission is made specifically to that UE. The value of the counter is signalled inside the message itself (or possibly by other signalling means) across the Uu interface. When the intended recipient UE correctly decodes a message, it also decodes the counter value. It compares this counter value with the last correctly received sequence number, which it holds in a memory ( 300 ), and deduces whether there are any missing sequence numbers, and accordingly effects transmission power control. 

   This provides the advantage that the transmitting entity is able to provide information to the receiving entity that enables a correct recipient-specific error statistic to be generated. When applied to 3GPP release 5 HS-SCCH for TDD, this technique is able to assist the UE in calculating a correct error statistic for the HS-SCCH enabling the UE then to correctly set the SIR target to meet the desired HS-SCCH error target, and to then consequently correctly set the TPC command direction as power-up or power-down.

Mixtures of polynorbornene with liquid fuel materials such as kerosene, gasoline, or the advanced missile and aircraft liquid fuels such as JP-4, JP-5, JP-9, JP-10, RJ-4, and RJ-5, for example, can contain 80% or more of the liquid fuel material and still exist in the form of a tough rubbery polymer which has excellent burning characteristics as a solid fuel for a ramjet. Many of these materials can be tailored to have heats of combustion higher than the state-of-the-art solid ramjet fuel formulations. In addition, self-sustaining gas generating compositions which can be used for such various purposes as solid propellants or gas generators for ducted rockets and the like can be fabricated by the inclusion in the polynorbornene, either alone or in conjunction with suitable liquid fuels and other additives of particulate oxidizer materials such as ammonium perchlorate or any of the other solid particulate oxidizers commonly used in the preparation of composite solid propellants. Suitable compositions can be prepared by admixture of the polynorbornene with the liquid fuel and suitable plasticizers and vulcanizing agents therefor. In the case in which a solid self-sustaining gas generating composition is to be formulated the suitable particulate oxidizing material and other solid ingredients can be mixed with the polynorbornene prior to the addition of the liquid ingredients and then curing the mixture into a tough rubbery polymeric structure.

Each cell's base station transmits a downlink reference signal at a known transmission power level. A mobile station monitors the received signal strength of the downlink reference signals from multiple base stations. The transmitted and received signal strength levels can be used by the mobile station to estimate the amount of intercell interference that the mobile station's uplink transmissions cause, and the mobile station's uplink transmission parameters are adjusted accordingly. In further embodiments, the received reference signal power levels, or values derived therefrom, are transmitted by the mobile station to its serving base station, where a scheduling algorithm uses the information to adjust one or more transmission parameters relating to a grant of uplink transmission resources to the UE, thereby controlling the intercell interference generated by the mobile station's uplink transmissions.",SONY CORP,ANDERSON NICHOLAS WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/013-107-255-169-783,Patent Application,yes,0,6,62,62,0,H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W72/542;;H04B17/24;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/14;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/21;;H04W16/14;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/14,H04W52/34;;H04L5/00;;H04W72/14,370/252,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Indicating device. SMITHS INDUSTRIES Ltd. 20 Sept., 1968 [25 Sept., 1967], No. 43632/67. Heading G5C. [Also in Division H1] Member 13, which may be of circular or polygonal cross-section, is movable to a plurality of discrete positions I-III wherein different arrays of markings are displayed at a window 11, each marking describing a function that will be performed when one of the switches 10a-10j is operated. Means for performing the functions, such as a computer and an aircraft navigation system, Fig. 2 (not shown), are such that the function performed depends both upon which switch 10 is operated and which of the faces of member 13 is displayed. These means are conditioned by a first switch operation to respond to a subsequent switch operation in a manner dependent also upon which switch was operated in the first switchoperation, as in the following example. Operation of switch 10a adjacent the designation ""NAV"" causes a signal to be fed to a computer (18), Fig. 2 (not shown) which in turn energizes a motor 14 to rotate member 13 to display face II upon which are various designations corresponding to navigational aids available for use. Operation of a switch now adjacent one of these causes the computer to display at an indicator panel (16), Fig. 2 (not shown), information appropriate to this aid. The computer is conditioned so that a navigational aid can only be selected in this way if the ""NAV"" switch was operated previously. Face III of member 13 could bear numerical data corresponding in a similar way to, say, the designation ""HDG"" on face I.

The terminals c, c of the bell and battery circuit are connected to two springs B, B', which, when free from constraint, come in contact and complete the circuit. To set the apparatus, the spring B<1> is pulled down, and held out of contact by a rod E which hooks into an eye on the spring B' and is held by a nut E' to the centre of the fusible disc F. A number of these contact-devices are fixed on the ceilings of rooms or other places readily exposed to high temperatures in case of fire. When the temperature is sufficiently high, the disc F is fused and the spring B' closes the circuit.

Oct. 12, 1904, [date applied for under Patents Act, 1901). Kinematographs. - Relates to a camera for taking a number of successive photographs on a plate, film, or the like, in more or less rapid succession, the camera being also adapted to be used as an ordinary one for taking ordinary photographs. When the camera is used for taking multiple photographs, the plate is moved intermittently across the light aperture, and it may be dropped a step at each end of its motion to enable a number of rows of photographs to be taken on one plate. The back B, which may be applied to any suitable camera, contains a removable diaphragm 2, the light aperture 3 in which can be adjusted, according to the number of rows of photographs it is desired to produce, by a vertically adjustable hinged flap 4, Fig. 3, engaged by a catch 7 at one end and carried by an adjustable rod 6 at the other end. The plate holder 13 and its sheath 14 are provided with vertical guides 11 carried by a base 8 mounted on rollers 9. In producing photographs in rapid succession, the plate is moved horizontally intermittently by a pin on a chain 31 engaging a slotted part 33 hinged to the carrier. The chain 31 passes over sprocket-wheels operated by pawl and ratchet-wheel gearing 26 connected, as shown, to a crank spindle 19. The plate holder 13 has a pin 16 engaging a slot in the cover 14 and adapted to engage a hook 18 to hold the two parts together when removed from the camera. Before exposure, the holder and its cover are raised until a pin 35 engages a catch 36, and the pin 16 is brought above the upper of a series of guide shelves 38 arranged as shown. When the plate is moved into position to take the first photograph, the pin 35 is released, and the cover 14 drops. The distance the plate drops at the end of a row of photographs is determined by the guide shelves 38, which can be adjusted by their projecting ends 39, Fig. 4, so as to allow the plates to fall through a distance equal to the space between any number of shelves at once. When the camera makes its last reciprocation, it trips an indicator 40. To prevent exposure during the motion of the plate, there is used a shutter composed of two semicircular parts 41, 42 mounted on a shaft 43 operated in unison with the photographic plate by the gearing shown. The size of the shutter aperture 45 is adjusted by moving one part 42 with respect to the other part 41, the two parts being held together by locking- devices 44. When the camera is used as a multipleview camera with time exposures, the shutter is folded up, and the operating-gearing is dispensed with, the plate carrier being moved horizontally by a bar graduated to enable the carrier to be moved the proper distance ; when it is used as an ordinary plate camera, the diaphragm 2 may be removed also, and the plate-holder guides are arranged horizontally and the plate &c. holder is moved into and out of its cover by a rod engaging the pin 16.",ANDERSON JAMES WILLIAM,ANDERSON JAMES WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/195-764-219-810-06X,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Each cell's base station transmits a downlink reference signal at a known transmission power level. A mobile station monitors the received signal strength of the downlink reference signals from multiple base stations. The transmitted and received signal strength levels can be used by the mobile station to estimate the amount of intercell interference that the mobile station's uplink transmissions cause, and the mobile station's uplink transmission parameters are adjusted accordingly. In further embodiments, the received reference signal power levels, or values derived therefrom, are transmitted by the mobile station to its serving base station, where a scheduling algorithm uses the information to adjust one or more transmission parameters relating to a grant of uplink transmission resources to the UE, thereby controlling the intercell interference generated by the mobile station's uplink transmissions.

Mixtures of polynorbornene with liquid fuel materials such as kerosene, gasoline, or the advanced missile and aircraft liquid fuels such as JP-4, JP-5, JP-9, JP-10, RJ-4, and RJ-5, for example, can contain 80% or more of the liquid fuel material and still exist in the form of a tough rubbery polymer which has excellent burning characteristics as a solid fuel for a ramjet. Many of these materials can be tailored to have heats of combustion higher than the state-of-the-art solid ramjet fuel formulations. In addition, self-sustaining gas generating compositions which can be used for such various purposes as solid propellants or gas generators for ducted rockets and the like can be fabricated by the inclusion in the polynorbornene, either alone or in conjunction with suitable liquid fuels and other additives of particulate oxidizer materials such as ammonium perchlorate or any of the other solid particulate oxidizers commonly used in the preparation of composite solid propellants. Suitable compositions can be prepared by admixture of the polynorbornene with the liquid fuel and suitable plasticizers and vulcanizing agents therefor.

Each cell's base station transmits a downlink reference signal at a known transmission power level. A mobile station monitors the received signal strength of the downlink reference signals from multiple base stations. The transmitted and received signal strength levels can be used by the mobile station to estimate the amount of intercell interference that the mobile station's uplink transmissions cause, and the mobile station's uplink transmission parameters are adjusted accordingly. In further embodiments, the received reference signal power levels, or values derived therefrom, are transmitted by the mobile station to its serving base station, where a scheduling algorithm uses the information to adjust one or more transmission parameters relating to a grant of uplink transmission resources to the UE, thereby controlling the intercell interference generated by the mobile station's uplink transmissions.",SONY CORP,ANDERSON NICHOLAS WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/123-619-967-717-810,Granted Patent,yes,28,0,62,62,0,H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W72/542;;H04B17/24;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/14;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/21;;H04W16/14;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/14,H04W36/00;;H04B17/24;;H04L5/00;;H04L5/14;;H04W16/14;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/28;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/08;;H04W72/12;;H04W72/14,,36,1,066-445-419-005-780,10.1109/vetecs.2005.1543552,"Chinese Office Action issued Aug. 15, 2014, in China Patent Application No. 201210196125.7 (with English translation).;;""3rd Generation Partnership Project: Technical Specification Group Serives and System Aspects; Vocabulary for 3GPP Specifications (Release 6),"" (Jun. 2005). 3GPP: Valbonne, France, TR 21.905 v6.9.0:1-54.;;Alcatel.

A mobile station monitors the received signal strength of the downlink reference signals from multiple base stations. The transmitted and received signal strength levels can be used by the mobile station to estimate the amount of intercell interference that the mobile station's uplink transmissions cause, and the mobile station's uplink transmission parameters are adjusted accordingly. In further embodiments, the received reference signal power levels, or values derived therefrom, are transmitted by the mobile station to its serving base station, where a scheduling algorithm uses the information to adjust one or more transmission parameters relating to a grant of uplink transmission resources to the UE, thereby controlling the intercell interference generated by the mobile station's uplink transmissions.",SONY CORP,ANDERSON NICHOLAS WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/151-168-179-657-314,Patent Application,no,0,0,62,62,0,H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W72/542;;H04B17/24;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/14;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/21;;H04W16/14;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/14,H04W72/08;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/12;;H04W72/14,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Each cell's base station transmits a downlink reference signal at a known transmission power level. A mobile station monitors the received signal strength of the downlink reference signals from multiple base stations. The transmitted and received signal strength levels can be used by the mobile station to estimate the amount of intercell interference that the mobile station's uplink transmissions cause, and the mobile station's uplink transmission parameters are adjusted accordingly. In further embodiments, the received reference signal power levels, or values derived therefrom, are transmitted by the mobile station to its serving base station, where a scheduling algorithm uses the information to adjust one or more transmission parameters relating to a grant of uplink transmission resources to the UE, thereby controlling the intercell interference generated by the mobile station's uplink transmissions.",IP WIRELESS INC,WILLIAM ANDERSON NICHOLAS,NANKAI UNIVERSITY (2010-08-24),https://lens.org/089-492-535-727-111,Patent Application,no,0,12,62,62,0,H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W72/542;;H04B17/24;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/14;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/21;;H04W16/14;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/14,H04B7/005;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/14,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The heating stages are preferably carried out so that the hardness is initially 45 Rockwell C and the later maximum hardness attained is 65 Rockwell C. The temperatures in the two stages are then 1697 DEG F. and 2255 DEG F. respectively. Before hardening a saw blade the teeth are preferably formed, and if desired set. After cooling, preferably by standing in still air at room temperature for within one to two hours with a saw band, the tool is tempered. In an example, pinpointed flames issuing from two rows of nozzles on opposite sides of the path of a saw band and positioned to impinge only on the tips of the passing teeth are employed in the second stage.

A mobile station monitors the received signal strength of the downlink reference signals from multiple base stations. The transmitted and received signal strength levels can be used by the mobile station to estimate the amount of intercell interference that the mobile station's uplink transmissions cause, and the mobile station's uplink transmission parameters are adjusted accordingly. In further embodiments, the received reference signal power levels, or values derived therefrom, are transmitted by the mobile station to its serving base station, where a scheduling algorithm uses the information to adjust one or more transmission parameters relating to a grant of uplink transmission resources to the UE, thereby controlling the intercell interference generated by the mobile station's uplink transmissions.",SONY CORP,ANDERSON NICHOLAS WILLIAM,NANKAI UNIVERSITY (2010-08-24),https://lens.org/154-341-170-691-60X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,62,62,0,H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W72/542;;H04B17/24;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/14;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/21;;H04W16/14;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/14,H04B7/005;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/14,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Each cell's base station transmits a downlink reference signal at a known transmission power level. A mobile station monitors the received signal strength of the downlink reference signals from multiple base stations. The transmitted and received signal strength levels can be used by the mobile station to estimate the amount of intercell interference that the mobile station's uplink transmissions cause, and the mobile station's uplink transmission parameters are adjusted accordingly. In further embodiments, the received reference signal power levels, or values derived therefrom, are transmitted by the mobile station to its serving base station, where a scheduling algorithm uses the information to adjust one or more transmission parameters relating to a grant of uplink transmission resources to the UE, thereby controlling the intercell interference generated by the mobile station's uplink transmissions.",IPWIRELESS INC,ANDERSON NICHOLAS WILLIAM,"SONY CORPORATION (2010-07-07);;NORTHROP GRUMMAN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, INC.

Adjusting body height. ENGINEERING RESEARCH & APPLICATION Ltd. March 10, 1959 [March 26, 1958], No. 9674/58. Class 108(2). A levelling valve for a vehicle suspension system has inlet ports 23, 24 an exhaust port 25 and a supply port 26. A height sensing rod 28 projects from one end of the valve and has on its lower end a valve member 37. A further valve member 38 is also provided. In operation, whilst the valve is out of action, the outlet 26 to an air spring bellows is closed by a valve head 43 and the valve member 37 is held by a spring 41 against the inlet end of a bore 33. When levelling of the vehicle is required high pressure air is supplied to the valve through the ports 23, 24, thus forcing the valve member 37 up until the rod 28 comes into contact with an abutment which is connected with the sprung part of the vehicle. Simultaneously the valve member 38 is moved to a position in which a conduit 55 connects the bore 33 with the bellows supply port 26. Air will now enter or leave the bellows depending upon the position of the abutment connected to the sprung portion of the vehicle. A modification is described, Fig. 3, (not shown), in which the sliding valve member corresponding to valve member 38 has three lands and two outlet ports are provided. Thus, air can be supplied to two bellows.

Each cell's base station transmits a downlink reference signal at a known transmission power level. A mobile station monitors the received signal strength of the downlink reference signals from multiple base stations. The transmitted and received signal strength levels can be used by the mobile station to estimate the amount of intercell interference that the mobile station's uplink transmissions cause, and the mobile station's uplink transmission parameters are adjusted accordingly. In further embodiments, the received reference signal power levels, or values derived therefrom, are transmitted by the mobile station to its serving base station, where a scheduling algorithm uses the information to adjust one or more transmission parameters relating to a grant of uplink transmission resources to the UE, thereby controlling the intercell interference generated by the mobile station's uplink transmissions.",IPWIRELESS INC,ANDERSON NICHOLAS WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/055-664-848-816-38X,Patent Application,no,0,25,62,62,0,H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W72/542;;H04B17/24;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/14;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/21;;H04W16/14;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/14,H04W52/34;;H04W72/14,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Each cell's base station transmits a downlink reference signal at a known transmission power level. A mobile station monitors the received signal strength of the downlink reference signals from multiple base stations. The transmitted and received signal strength levels can be used by the mobile station to estimate the amount of intercell interference that the mobile station's uplink transmissions cause, and the mobile station's uplink transmission parameters are adjusted accordingly. In further embodiments, the received reference signal power levels, or values derived therefrom, are transmitted by the mobile station to its serving base station, where a scheduling algorithm uses the information to adjust one or more transmission parameters relating to a grant of uplink transmission resources to the UE, thereby controlling the intercell interference generated by the mobile station's uplink transmissions.",ANDERSON NICHOLAS WILLIAM;;SONY CORP,ANDERSON NICHOLAS WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/061-614-952-816-63X,Granted Patent,yes,24,0,62,62,0,H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W72/542;;H04B17/24;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/14;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/21;;H04W16/14;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/14,H04L5/00;;H04J3/00;;H04L5/14;;H04W16/14;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/08;;H04W72/12;;H04W72/14,,35,1,066-445-419-005-780,10.1109/vetecs.2005.1543552,"Korean Office Action issued Mar. 2, 2012 in patent application No. 10-2011-7031288 with English translation.;;Stefan Parkvall, et al., ""WCDMA Enhanced Uplink-Principles and Basic Operation"", IEEE, 2005, 6 pages, as early as Jan. 2005.;;""3rd Generation Partnership Project: Technical Specification Group Serives and System Aspects; Vocabulary for 3GPP Specifications (Release 6),"" (Jun. 2005). 3GPP: Valbonne, France, TR 21.905 v6.9.0:1-54.;;Alcatel.

Each cell's base station transmits a downlink reference signal at a known transmission power level. A mobile station monitors the received signal strength of the downlink reference signals from multiple base stations. The transmitted and received signal strength levels can be used by the mobile station to estimate the amount of intercell interference that the mobile station's uplink transmissions cause, and the mobile station's uplink transmission parameters are adjusted accordingly. In further embodiments, the received reference signal power levels, or values derived therefrom, are transmitted by the mobile station to its serving base station, where a scheduling algorithm uses the information to adjust one or more transmission parameters relating to a grant of uplink transmission resources to the UE, thereby controlling the intercell interference generated by the mobile station's uplink transmissions.

Preferably, the cellulose ether is methyl cellulose and the polyoxyalkylene glycol is polyoxyethylene glycol. The diglycidyl ether may be present in an amount of 1-30% by weight of the composition. Subsequent heating of the composition, suitably at 60-200 DEG C., and especially at 100-160 DEG C., renders it insoluble in water. A catalytic amount of a tertiary amine may also be present, suitably 0.1-1.0% by weight, based on the diglycidyl ether. Specified water-soluble cellulose ethers include ethyl, carboxymethyl, hydroxyethyl, hydroxypropyl, sulphoethyl and hydroxypropyl methyl celluloses. Suitable ethers are the water-soluble and self-dispersing polyglycol derivatives corresponding to the formula <FORM:1019228/C3/1> in which O-alkylene represents an oxyalkylene radical in which the alkylene radical is a 1,2-alkylene radical containing 2 to 3 carbon atoms, i.e., ethylene, 1,2-propylene or 1-chloro-2,3-propylene, R is the bivalent residue of a starter compound formed by the removal of two active hydrogen atoms from said compound; and x and y are integers whose sum is 2 to 20. Active hydrogen atoms are defined as those reactive toward alkylene oxides in the presence of the usual catalysts for the condensation of alkylene oxides, and such active hydrogen compounds include water, glycols, primary amines, bis (sec. amines), alkanolamines, diphenols, amides and carboxylic acids. Hence polyoxyalkylene glycols having alkylene radicals containing a halogen, e.g. 1-chloro-2,3-propylene, the radical derived from epichlorhydrin, may be used. In examples, the diglycidyl ether of polyoxyethylene glycol of average molecular weight 400, of diethylene glycol, of dipropylene glycol, and of polyepichlorhydrin of average molecular weight 450 are used with methyl cellulose and triethylamine as catalyst. Specified catalysts for the reaction of glycidyl groups with aliphatic hydroxyl groups include trimethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamines, and water-soluble trialkylamines in general, trialkanolamines e.g. triethanolamine, and heterocyclic bases, e.g. pyridine, N-alkyl piperidine, quinoline, N-alkyl pyrroles and pyrrolidines. In examples, the cellulose ether and the polyoxyalkylene glycol diglycidyl ether are dissolved in water, catalyst added, films cast from the solution, dried, and then heated to insolubilize the composition.",DOW CHEMICAL CO,ANDERSON ARTHUR WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/183-711-809-257-132,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,C08B11/20,C08B11/20,B5B B230          67;;B5B B32Y          67;;B5B B396          67;;B5B B412          67;;C3B BEX           BEX;;C3B B1D2A         BEX;;C3B B1N1N         BEX;;C3B B1N6D3        BEX;;C3B B1N6D4        BEX;;C3B B1N6D7        BEX;;C3F F326          K;;C3F F43Y          K;;C3F F440          K;;C3F F723          K,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Each cell's base station transmits a downlink reference signal at a known transmission power level. A mobile station monitors the received signal strength of the downlink reference signals from multiple base stations. The transmitted and received signal strength levels can be used by the mobile station to estimate the amount of intercell interference that the mobile station's uplink transmissions cause, and the mobile station's uplink transmission parameters are adjusted accordingly. In further embodiments, the received reference signal power levels, or values derived therefrom, are transmitted by the mobile station to its serving base station, where a scheduling algorithm uses the information to adjust one or more transmission parameters relating to a grant of uplink transmission resources to the UE, thereby controlling the intercell interference generated by the mobile station's uplink transmissions.

Aircraft navigation computing. SMITHS INDUSTRIES Ltd. 7 Feb., 1966 [5 Feb., 1965], No. 5080/65. Heading G4G [Also in Division H4] In an aircraft navigation instrument a signal representing the difference between actual aircraft height H and the sum of the height H d of a predetermined destination point and the change C in height to the destination point is derived and utilized to actuate an indicator index 12 or an automatic pilot 15. The quantity C is obtained utilizing a distance measuring equipment 1 in the aircraft in conjunction with a responder at the destination point and a potentiometer 3 into which the desired flight slope is set in manually. The distance-to-go signal is differentiated to give ground speed and the latter, together with the former and a correction signal (allowing for change in height) controls a "" time-to-go "" index 20 on the aircraft clock. The ground speed signal is multiplied by the desired flight slope to afford control of a further index 18 representing required rate of change of height relative to that correct for the desired flight slope. The actual height H is taken from a barometric altimeter and the H d signal is corrected for actual ground level air pressure at the destination point. Switch 2 is normally closed but is opened at the destination so that automatic pilot 15 can maintain the aircraft at height H d . The invention may be applied to ascending as well as descending paths; such paths need not necessarily be in a single straight line. The use of dead reckoning up-dated by a Doppler system is mentioned; the use of a hyperbolic radio navigation system is also mentioned.",SMITHS INDUSTRIES LTD,ANDERSON EDWARD WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/162-731-602-460-594,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G01S1/02,G01S1/02,G4G G2B1          -;;G4G G2F1          -;;G4G G2X           -;;G4G G3A1          -;;G4G G3A2          -;;G4G G3A6          -;;G4G G4A5          -;;H4D DAB           AB;;H4D D276          AB;;H4D D276          3;;H4D D34X          AB;;H4D D34X          3;;H4D D361          AB;;H4D D361          3;;H4D D364          AB;;H4D D364          3;;H4D D365          AB;;H4D D365          3;;H4D D66X          AB;;H4D D66X          3,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Each cell's base station transmits a downlink reference signal at a known transmission power level. A mobile station monitors the received signal strength of the downlink reference signals from multiple base stations. The transmitted and received signal strength levels can be used by the mobile station to estimate the amount of intercell interference that the mobile station's uplink transmissions cause, and the mobile station's uplink transmission parameters are adjusted accordingly. In further embodiments, the received reference signal power levels, or values derived therefrom, are transmitted by the mobile station to its serving base station, where a scheduling algorithm uses the information to adjust one or more transmission parameters relating to a grant of uplink transmission resources to the UE, thereby controlling the intercell interference generated by the mobile station's uplink transmissions.",SONY CORP,ANDERSON NICHOLAS WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/033-868-721-610-065,Granted Patent,no,0,0,62,62,0,H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W72/542;;H04B17/24;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/14;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/21;;H04W16/14;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/14,H04W72/14;;H04W52/34,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

SMITHS INDUSTRIES Ltd. 7 July, 1967 [7 July, 1966], No. 30577/66. Heading G4G. [Also in Division G1] In navigation apparatus, to compensate for the distortion of the earth's magnetic field by the presence of the vehicle or craft carrying the apparatus, two magnetic field detecting systems 1, 2 (Fig. 2), are employed, spaced along the length of a non-magnetic boom 3 extending rearwardly of the vehicle, each producing two signals indicative of the magnitude of the local field along two perpendicular directions. These two signals are then combined, in pairs, to produce two signals indicative of the magnitude of the earth's field along the two directions which are also indicative of the direction of travel of the vehicle relative to magnetic north and east directions. Two pairs of flux gates, 1, 2, see also Fig. 3 (not shown), with the axes of their cores 4, 5 arranged parallel and perpendicular to the axis of the boom produce output signals whose amplitudes are indicative of H cos # m + x, H sin # m + y and H cos # m +X, H sin # m +Y, respectively, whose x, y and X, Y, are the components of the local field, at the two positions, due to the presence of the vehicle and # m is the angle between the direction of the vehicle and magnetic north. The two signals from flux gates 2 are then multiplied by factors x/X and y/Y, respectively, by potentiometers 10, 12 and the corresponding signals from the two pairs of flux gates are compared in amplifiers 11, 13 to produce signals corresponding to H(1- x/X) . cos # m and H(1 - y/Y) . sin # m . For the vehicle where x/X = y/Y, these two signals are proportional to cos # m and sin # m , respectively. Alternatively one of the two signals may be multiplied or divided by the factor to provide signals proportional to cos # m and sin # m . These two signals are then converted in unit 15 to signals proportional to cos # and sin #, where # is the angle between the vehicle direction and true north, the sliders of potentiometers 17, 19 being set to a position proportional to tan M, where M is the angle between true north and magnetic north, i.e. # m +M=#. Finally these two signals are fed to a compass 21, driven by a two-phase synchro torque receiver or a synchro resolver. The signals may also be used to determine the distance travelled by the vehicle along a northerly and easterly direction by integrating the two components V cos #, V sin #, of the velocity V, derived by a pick-off 26 coupled to the transmission of the vehicle. This may be done, Fig. 4 (not shown), by integrating the output of amplifiers whose input signals are proportional to cos # and sin # and whose gains are controlled in proportion to V. Alternatively, Fig. 5 (not shown), a signal proportional to V may be intermittently integrated for periods of time proportional to cos # and sin # respectively; In a modification the unit 15 may involve a resolver having a pair of perpendicular rotor windings rotatable with respect to a pair of perpendicular stator windings, the rotor being set to an angular position with respect to the stator which depends on the angle M. Provision is also made for applying a manually variable magnetic field to one or both of the pairs of flux gates to modify the magnetic field produced by the vehicle.

Each cell's base station transmits a downlink reference signal at a known transmission power level. A mobile station monitors the received signal strength of the downlink reference signals from multiple base stations. The transmitted and received signal strength levels can be used by the mobile station to estimate the amount of intercell interference that the mobile station's uplink transmissions cause, and the mobile station's uplink transmission parameters are adjusted accordingly. In further embodiments, the received reference signal power levels, or values derived therefrom, are transmitted by the mobile station to its serving base station, where a scheduling algorithm uses the information to adjust one or more transmission parameters relating to a grant of uplink transmission resources to the UE, thereby controlling the intercell interference generated by the mobile station's uplink transmissions.",SONY COMPANY,ANDERSON NICHOLAS WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/092-357-581-210-718,Patent Application,no,0,0,62,62,0,H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W72/542;;H04B17/24;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/14;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/21;;H04W16/14;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/14,H04W52/34;;H04B17/00;;H04W72/14,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

Each cell's base station transmits a downlink reference signal at a known transmission power level. A mobile station monitors the received signal strength of the downlink reference signals from multiple base stations. The transmitted and received signal strength levels can be used by the mobile station to estimate the amount of intercell interference that the mobile station's uplink transmissions cause, and the mobile station's uplink transmission parameters are adjusted accordingly. In further embodiments, the received reference signal power levels, or values derived therefrom, are transmitted by the mobile station to its serving base station, where a scheduling algorithm uses the information to adjust one or more transmission parameters relating to a grant of uplink transmission resources to the UE, thereby controlling the intercell interference generated by the mobile station's uplink transmissions.",SONY CORP,WILLIAM ANDERSON NICHOLAS,,https://lens.org/173-878-023-997-157,Patent Application,no,1,4,62,62,0,H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W72/542;;H04B17/24;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/14;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/21;;H04W16/14;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/14,H04B17/00;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/14,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

March 11, 1953, No. 6745/63. Class 135. A valve for automatically controlling the operation of a vacuum motor or the like comprises a valve chamber with spaced parallel walls 7, 14 one of which has a tubular extension 18 connectible to a source of vacuum and a valve seat 20, and the other 7 of which has secured thereto another tubular extension 29 which may be connected to a vacuum motor or other device to be operated, a flexible valve element 9 movably mounted in the valve chamber so as to be responsive to the difference of fluid pressure between its opposite sides, and means for normally supporting the valve element in a position slightly spaced from its seat. The latter means comprises a dished pressure plate 10 an off-set flange 34 on which presses the ends of the valve element against a rest 23 formed as a corrugation in the circular end wall 14. The plate 10 has apertures 36 for the passage of fluid and a central neck or flange 35 which locates one end of a compression spring 13 the other end of which is supported by a conical abutment 37 carried on the inner end of an adjusting screw 11. The screw 11 is supported in a bearing 27 secured to the end wall or cover 7 of the valve chamber. The screw 11 is operated by a knurled head 41 having a reduced neck 43 embraced by the spring arms 45 of a hairpin-like clip 46 also embracing the tubular extension 29. The clip thus holds the screw 11 in adjusted position. The valve element is substantially oblong in shape being curved at the ends to conform to the circular wall 15 of the valve chamber. The valve element is normally flat but under the pressure of the plate 10 on its ends becomes dished or curved in both the vertical and horizontal planes. On the attainment of a certain fluid flow the valve element snaps over from the curved form to a position adjacent the valve seat and further increase of flow causes the valve to seal completely against the seat 20. The valve element has a central vent hole 33 to deal with high values of fluid flow above the snapover point and may be exchanged for a valve element having a vent hole of different size. The invention is particularly applicable to the vacuum motors of windscreen wipers for motor vehicles, the motor being connected by a flexible hose to the tubular connection 29, and the intake manifold of the engine being similarly connected to the tubular connection 18. In a modification, Fig. 9, the spring element loosely supports a valve member 55 with a conical portion 60, 61 of different diameter. The valve member 55 co-operates with an aperture 56 in the flexible valve element 48 and may be adjusted by the screw 52 to suit motors of different capacity.",PRODUCTIVE INVENTIONS INC,ANDERSON JOHN WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/171-293-480-991-715,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G05D7/0126,G05D7/01,F2V VS23          VS23,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A reporting system provides users selective access to information, such as standard reports, custom reports, and ad hoc reports. Reports are represented as report objects that store characteristics that must be fulfilled prior to a user being granted access to a report. Upon a user request for a specific report, the characteristics of the user are compared with the characteristics stored in the corresponding report object. If the user characteristics match the report object, then the user is granted access to the corresponding report. If the user characteristics do not match the report object, then the user is denied access to the corresponding report. Accordingly, access to a report is verified twice, once upon presenting an indication of the available reports to the user and again when a selected report is accessed. Preferably, the reporting system comprises a report server connected to a network, such as the Internet.

Each cell's base station transmits a downlink reference signal at a known transmission power level. A mobile station monitors the received signal strength of the downlink reference signals from multiple base stations. The transmitted and received signal strength levels can be used by the mobile station to estimate the amount of intercell interference that the mobile station's uplink transmissions cause, and the mobile station's uplink transmission parameters are adjusted accordingly. In further embodiments, the received reference signal power levels, or values derived therefrom, are transmitted by the mobile station to its serving base station, where a scheduling algorithm uses the information to adjust one or more transmission parameters relating to a grant of uplink transmission resources to the UE, thereby controlling the intercell interference generated by the mobile station's uplink transmissions.",SONY CORP,ANDERSON NICHOLAS WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/045-687-606-886-042,Granted Patent,yes,3,0,62,62,0,H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W72/542;;H04B17/24;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/14;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/21;;H04W16/14;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/14,H04B7/005;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/14,,1,0,,,"KAARANAN H ET AL: ""UMTS Networks: Architecture, Mobility and Services, PASSAGE"", UMTS NETWORKS.

SMITHS INDUSTRIES Ltd. 7 July, 1967 [7 July, 1966], No. 1855/70. Divided out of 1,196,262. Heading G4G. [Also in Division G1] The description is substantially identical with that of the parent Specification 1,196,262 but the claims relate to the arrangement of Fig. 4 (identical with Fig. 5 of the parent Specification) for combining two signals K cos # and K sin # with a third signal V, representing velocity, to obtain signals representing V cos # and V sin 0, and integrating them to obtain the distances travelled by a craft in a northerly and easterly direction. As shown (Fig. 4), an A.C. signal K cos # is fed to a phase-rectifier 40 to produce a first output signal which is + or - corresponding to the sign of output and is fed to integrator 42, and a second output signal corresponding to the amplitude which is fed to amplifier 46 and switch 44. Amplifier 46 is also fed with a sawtooth voltage from integrator 47, and when these are equal the output from 46 is zero and switch 44 is opened. Hence the signal K cos # is fed in pulses whose durations are proportional to K cos # to an integrator 45, so that the signal reaching 45 is proportional to K<SP>2</SP> cos<SP>2</SP> #. This is added to a second similar input to integrator 45 proportional to K<SP>2</SP> sin<SP>2</SP> #, derived from an A.C. signal K sin #, and opposed by the sawtooth voltage from integrator 47. When the sawtooth voltage reaches the value K<SP>2</SP> cos<SP>2</SP> #+K<SP>2</SP> sin<SP>2</SP> #, i.e. K<SP>2</SP>, the output from integrator 45 is zero and detector 52 resets the integrator 47 to initiate another sawtooth wave. Hence the period of the sawtooth voltage is dependent on K<SP>2</SP> and therefore on K. A further switch 43 is operated by amplifier 46 with switch 44 to feed a velocity signal V to integrator 42 in pulses whose duration is proportional to K cos # and with a periodicity dependent on K. Hence the input to integrator 42 is proportional to V cos # and its output is the distance travelled in the northerly direction by a craft moving with velocity V at an angle # to the magnetic north. A similar network feeds a signal V sin # to an integrator 48 whose output is therefore the distance travelled in an easterly direction by the craft.",SMITHS INDUSTRIES LTD,ANDERSON EDWARD WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/096-479-862-757-438,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G01C17/00;;G06G7/78;;G01C21/16;;G01C21/16,G01C17/00;;G01C21/00;;G06G7/78,G1N NAAJC2        AAJC2;;G1N N1A1          AAJC2;;G1N N1A3A         AAJC2;;G1N N1A5A         AAJC2;;G1N N1D7          AAJC2;;G1N N3S1A         AAJC2;;G1N N3S1B         AAJC2;;G1N N3S12         AAJC2;;G1N N7L1A         AAJC2;;G1N N7L2          AAJC2;;G1N N7L3          AAJC2;;G4G G2B14         -;;G4G G2F2          -;;G4G G3AX          -;;G4G G3A1          -;;G4G G3A10         -;;G4G G3A2          -;;G4G G3A3B         -;;G4G G3A5          -;;G4G G3A8A         -;;G4G G4A5          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Each cell's base station transmits a downlink reference signal at a known transmission power level. A mobile station monitors the received signal strength of the downlink reference signals from multiple base stations. The transmitted and received signal strength levels can be used by the mobile station to estimate the amount of intercell interference that the mobile station's uplink transmissions cause, and the mobile station's uplink transmission parameters are adjusted accordingly. In further embodiments, the received reference signal power levels, or values derived therefrom, are transmitted by the mobile station to its serving base station, where a scheduling algorithm uses the information to adjust one or more transmission parameters relating to a grant of uplink transmission resources to the UE, thereby controlling the intercell interference generated by the mobile station's uplink transmissions.",SONY CORP,ANDERSON NICHOLAS WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/125-661-690-319-781,Granted Patent,yes,3,0,62,62,0,H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W72/542;;H04B17/24;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/14;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/21;;H04W16/14;;H04B17/24;;H04W52/283;;H04W24/10;;H04W48/16;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/23;;H04W72/542;;H04W72/541;;H04L5/0073;;H04L5/006;;H04L5/14,H04B7/005;;H04W52/34;;H04W72/14,,1,0,,,"KAARANAN H ET AL: ""UMTS Networks: Architecture, Mobility and Services, PASSAGE"", UMTS NETWORKS.

Mechanical constructions, details for building up.-The interlocking binding-pieces for connecting the parallel walls of toy buildings &c. described in the parent Specification are modified by being grooved and tongued at the ends so that each end of a binder can be interlocked with the adjoining end of a corresponding binder at rightangles and on the same level to prevent relative movement of the pieces in any direction in an horizontal plane. The binding-piece a is provided at each end with a longitudinal tongue a<2> and a transverse groove a<3> on the inner side. The corresponding binder b on the adjoining wall has reduced end portions with grooves b<3>, b<5> in the vertical surfaces b<2>, b<4> respectively. The tongue a<2> and the portion a<4> of the binder a engage the grooves b<5>, b' respectively of the binder b, while the portion b<6> of the binder b engages the groove a<3> in the binder a. Tongues a<5>, b<7> or grooves may be provided on the top or bottom surfaces, or both, of the binders. To prevent vertical displacement, slots a<6>, b<8> may be provided in the ends of the binders to receive a locking-piece.",ANDERSON WILLIAM GEORGE,ANDERSON WILLIAM GEORGE,,https://lens.org/191-767-768-481-340,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,3,0,A63H33/084,A63H33/08,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

According to this invention, it has been found that certain metal salts of the dithiocarbamates of multifunctional amines are effective precipitants for lead ions. When ingested simultaneously with lead paint they precipitate the lead ion in a substantially insoluble and indigestible form and thereby prevent absorption of lead into the blood stream. The preferred compounds are: zinc pentaerythrityl tetrakis (dithiocarbamate), tetrasodium pentaerythrityl tetrakis (dithiocarbamate), disodium ethylene bis(dithiocarbamate), and zinc ethylene bis(dithiocarbamate).

   A new oral polymeric controlled release formulation suitable for the once-a-day administration of valproate compounds, such as divalproex sodium, has been discovered. This formulation exhibits significant advantages over the sustained release valproate formulations of the prior art. This formulation minimizes the variation between peak and trough plasma levels of valproate over a 24 hour dosing period. This formulation follows a zero-order release pattern thus producing essentially flat plasma levels of valproate, once steady-state levels have been achieved. This results in a significantly lower incidence of side effects for patients consuming such a formulation.
