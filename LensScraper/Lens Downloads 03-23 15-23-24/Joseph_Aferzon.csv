The surgical procedure associated with this invention involves making small, discrete incisions for the placement of select pedicle screws. The extended tabs of the pedicle screws retract soft tissue, muscle and the like to thereby provide visibility and access to the head of the pedicle screw. Through the extended tabs, instrumentation such as a spine rod, set screw and other required hardware may be delivered to the pedicle screws. A collar may be coupled around the extended tabs to provide stability to the construct and a platform for additional components of this invention. Once a spine rod is secured to the pedicle screws, a frangible joint joining the tabs to the pedicle screw assembly is broken off using appropriate instrumentation and the extended tabs may be removed.",ZIMMER SPINE INC,KUESTER W MATTHEW;;HESTAD HUGH D;;AFERZON JOSEPH;;HICKEY PAUL,ZIMMER SPINE INC (2006-11-01);;ZIMMER BIOMET SPINE INC (2016-09-30),https://lens.org/155-713-003-461-381,Granted Patent,yes,29,67,4,4,0,A61B17/7037;;A61B17/7037;;A61B17/7032;;A61B17/7032;;A61B17/7086;;A61B17/7086;;A61B2090/037;;A61B2090/037,A61B17/70,606/246,1,0,,,"Zimmer Spine, Silhouette Spinal Fixation System, Catalog, Mar. 2005, 6 pgs.",ACTIVE
