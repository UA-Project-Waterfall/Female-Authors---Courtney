The insulating sleeve carries one or more lateral projections (32) of electrically insulating material spaced from the tip and the metallic shell part extends axially to the vicinity of the projection as a plurality of shell extension elements 1211, 1212 of limited circumferential extent separated by spaces 1231, (123)2 that define lateral sleeve exposing openings. The extension elements define with the sleeve projection secondary spark gaps G2 and the openings permit fuel to access the counterbore in the vicinity of the secondary spark gaps and a flame front of fuel ignited by a spark at a secondary gap to pass efficiently into the combustion chamber. The limited exposure of the sleeve to the combustion chamber by the opening spaces and accessibility of the counterbore ensures less fouling and better cooling of the sleeve that enables it to function at higher engine temperatures.

Before the insulator 26 is inserted into the shell 34, the intermediate part 36 is typically mounted on a lower sash bar part of the insulator outer surface 50. A shell firing end 56 is typically aligned with a lower end edge and an intermediate firing end. Since an inner diameter Dc of the conductive component is smaller than an outer diameter Dio of the insulator just below the lower sash bar part, the thickness of the insulator 26 increases toward an electrode firing end 40.SELECTED DRAWING: Figure 1",FED MOGUL IGNITION CO,JOHN ANTHONY BURROWS;;JOHN E MILLER;;KRISTAPHER I MIXWELL;;JAMES D LYKOWSKI,,https://lens.org/185-229-294-707-110,Patent Application,no,12,0,19,49,0,H01T13/50;;H01T13/36;;H01T13/44;;H01T21/02;;Y10T29/49227;;Y10T29/49002;;Y10T29/49227;;H01T19/04;;H01T19/02;;H01T13/50;;H01T21/02;;H01T13/44;;H01T13/36;;H01T19/00;;Y10T29/49002;;F02P23/045;;H01T21/00,H01T13/20;;F02P3/01;;F02P13/00;;F02P23/04;;H01T13/36;;H01T13/50;;H01T19/04;;H01T21/02,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

In response to each arc formation, the energy provided to the corona igniter is shut off for a short time. The driver circuit also obtains information about the arc formations, such as timing of generation of the first arc formation and number of occurrences.
