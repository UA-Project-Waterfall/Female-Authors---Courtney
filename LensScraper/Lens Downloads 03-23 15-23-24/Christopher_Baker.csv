Each mail piece is individually removed by an operator while the computer monitors the weight of the bin and simultaneously produces serial numbers for affixing to each mail piece. In an alternative embodiment a postage meter provides postage imprinting and labelling for each mail piece removed. By monitoring the tare weight difference of the bin prior to and after removal of each mail piece, the mail piece weight is determined from the difference between the two tare weights. The weight of each mail piece is required in order to determine postage cost or mail charges for each mail piece. After all pieces of mail are removed from the bin, an operator can optionally key the system to produce a postal service form complying with manifest mailing requirements. The computer also produces a manifest including serial numbers and mail charges related to each serial number marked mail piece and a manifest summary. In an alternate embodiment, the bin is loaded one by one with each mail piece while a computer simultaneously monitors the weight of the bin as each mail piece is added, serial numbers are produced for affixing to each mail piece, and the computer links each serial number with a weight deviation thereby calculating mail charges for each mail piece and storing the information for reproduction in summary form in a mailing manifest.",MAIL CODE INC,BAKER CHRISTOPHER A,M.A.I.L.CODE INC.

The weight of each mail piece is required in order to determine postage cost or mail charges for each mail piece. After all pieces of mail are removed from the bin, an operator can optionally key the system to produce a postal service form complying with manifest mailing requirements. The computer also produces a manifest including serial numbers and mail charges related to each serial number marked mail piece and a manifest summary. In an alternate embodiment, the bin is loaded one by one with each mail piece while a computer simultaneously monitors the weight of the bin as each mail piece is added, serial numbers are produced for affixing to each mail piece, and the computer links each serial number with a weight deviation thereby calculating mail charges for each mail piece and storing the information for reproduction in summary form in a mailing manifest.",MAIL CODE INC,BAKER CHRISTOPHER A,M.A.I.L.CODE INC.

In the prior art, the call was routed back to the carrier switch from which the information assistance service provider received the call, and that carrier completed the call. In the invention, the information assistance service provider chooses how to route the call to the destination requested by the caller. A routing database including routes available to terminate the call is searched and the call is routed after considering a number of criteria such as availability of routing trunks, the LATA (local access and transport area) within which the destination phone number resides, pricing information, or a combination of these criteria. Routing may be accomplished using a local exchange carrier (LEC), an inter-exchange (or long-distance) carrier (IXC), an inter-machine transfer trunk (IMT), which connects two or more information assistance service centers, or a combination of these.",METRO ONE TELECOMMUNICATIONS,BAKER NATHAN BRYANT;;HUEY CHRISTOPHER ALAN,GRAPE TECHNOLOGY GROUP INC (2008-05-07);;METRO ONE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INC (2002-05-30),https://lens.org/058-452-555-251-260,Granted Patent,yes,12,14,3,3,0,H04M3/42391;;H04M3/4931;;H04M3/4933;;H04M3/4935;;H04M7/00;;H04M15/00;;H04M15/49;;H04M15/8044;;H04M2203/158;;H04M2215/42;;H04M2215/46;;H04M2215/745;;H04Q3/66;;H04Q2213/13072;;H04Q2213/13141;;H04Q2213/13217;;H04Q2213/13376;;H04M15/8044;;H04Q2213/13141;;H04M3/4933;;H04M2215/745;;H04M3/4935;;H04M15/00;;H04M15/49;;H04M3/4931;;H04M3/42391;;H04Q3/66;;H04Q2213/13217;;H04M2215/46;;H04M2215/42;;H04M7/00;;H04Q2213/13376;;H04M2203/158;;H04Q2213/13072,H04M3/42;;H04M3/493;;H04M7/00;;H04M15/00;;H04Q3/66,379/218.01;;379/211.02,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The apparatus consists of a double acting hydraulic cylinder having one end connected to a furrow opener drag arm and the other end connectable to a drill rig. It incorporates a pressure cushioning system consisting of at least one pressure absorber and hydraulic lines communicating through a mode valve with both the thrust and draw sides of the double acting cylinder. It further communicates through a single or double acting hydraulic valve to the hydraulic pump and reservoir of an associated prime mover such as a tractor. The mode valve is hydraulically connected to both the thrust and draw sides of the double acting cylinder. In a first mode the mode valve is hydraulically connectable to the pressure cushioning system and in a second mode hydraulically connected through a double acting hydraulic valve to the hydraulic pump and hydraulic reservoir of the prime mover. In use when the mode valve is in the first mode the pressure absorber cushions forces transmitted hydraulically through the double acting hydraulic cylinder from the openers and maintains a substantially constant pressure on both the draw and thrust sides of the double acting cylinder to thereby create a net downward force from the ram onto the furrow opener arm. In the second mode the double acting hydraulic cylinder is operable by the double acting hydraulic valve to thrust or draw its ram to respectively lower or raise the furrow opener drag arm.,BAKER CHRISTOPHER J;;KERNOHAN CRAIG D,BAKER CHRISTOPHER J;;KERNOHAN CRAIG D,MASSEY UNIVERSITY A BODY CORP.

The separator system may also be controlled to separate and feed onto the transport system any subsequent media items which would cause said group of media items to exceed the predetermined thickness. In one arrangement, a series of media items are fed onto the transport system transport path for sortation into two or more sortation bins. The separator is controlled such that adjacent media items destined for the same sortation bin are transported along said transport path as a group of media items to the same sortation bin and such that adjacent media items destined for different sortation bins are separated for separate transport along the transport path to the different sortation bins. The order of the media items within groups created by said separator system may be controlled by an order diverter such that subsequent sortation of groups of media items will further differentiate the media items by media item order sequence of media items in each of the groups of media items. Additional controllable separators may be connected to the media item transport. The system may group media items for unescorted transport on a sorter or may group media items for escorted transport such as by being place in a carrier.

E. & Carroll, K. S. 2013 Chemical Reviews 113, 4633 - 679 ). Growth factor stimulation activates NADPH oxidase enzymes, releasing a local burst of hydrogen peroxide, which transiently oxidizes the nuclcophilic cysteine of protein phosphatases and other proximal redox active thiols (see, e.g., Paulsen, C.

   In an information assistance service environment, after information assistance is provided to a caller, the caller may request to have the information assistance service provider complete the call. In the prior art, the call was routed back to the carrier switch from which the information assistance service provider received the call, and that carrier completed the call. In the invention, the information assistance service provider chooses how to route the call to the destination requested by the caller. A routing database including routes available to terminate the call is searched and the call is routed after considering a number of criteria such as availability of routing trunks, the LATA (local access and transport area) within which the destination phone number resides, pricing information, or a combination of these criteria. Routing may be accomplished using a local exchange carrier (LEC), an inter-exchange (or long-distance) carrier (IXC), an inter-machine transfer trunk (IMT), which connects two or more information assistance service centers, or a combination of these.

E. & Carroll, K. S. 2013 Chemical Reviews 113, 4633-4679). Growth factor stimulation activates NADPH oxidase enzymes, releasing a local burst of hydrogen peroxide, which transiently oxidizes the nucleophilic cysteine of protein phosphatases and other proximal redox active thiols (see, e.g., Paulsen, C.

A user inputs a configuration for the mail piece which is translated by the data processor into a data structure and transmitted to the controller of the folder sealer apparatus. The controller controls devices comprised in the laser printer and the folder sealer by executing state routines in accordance with the data structure to produce the mail piece in the defined configuration. Concurrently the data processor transmits text from an output file to the laser printer for printing on printed sheets and envelope forms. The data processor also controls the laser printer to print an address for the mail piece either on an envelope form or on a printed sheet in a position where it will be visible through the envelope.

It incorporates a pressure cushioning system consisting of at least one pressure absorber and hydraulic lines communicating through a mode valve (12) with both the thrust draw sides (26, 28) of the double acting cylinder (10). It further communicates through a single or double acting hydraulic valve (16,18) to the hydraulic pump (17) and reservoir (19) of an associated prime mover such as a tractor. The mode valve (12) is hydraulically connected to both the thrust and draw sides (26,28) of the double acting cylinder (10). In a first mode the mode valve (12) is hydraulically connectable to the pressure cushioning system and in a second mode hydraulically connected through a double acting hydraulic valve (10) to the hydraulic pump (17) and hydraulic reservoir (19) of the prime mover. In use when the mode valve (12) is in the first mode the pressure absorber cushions forces transmitted hydraulically through the double acting hydraulic cylinder (10) from the openers and maintains a substantially constant pressure on both the draw and thrust sides (26, 28) of the double acting cylinder (10) to thereby create a net downward force from the ram (22) onto the furrow opener arm.

Protein sulfenylation (Cys-SOH) describes the reversible post-translational modification of protein thiols by hydrogen peroxide, and plays a central role in oxidative signaling (see, e.g., Paulsen, C. E. & Carroll, K. S. 2013 Chemical Reviews 113, 4633-679). Growth factor stimulation activates NADPH oxidase enzymes, releasing a local burst of hydrogen peroxide, which transiently oxidizes the nuclcophilic cysteine of protein phosphatases and other proximal redox active thiols (see, e.g., Paulsen, C. E. et al., 2012 Nature Chemical Biology 8, 57-64).

The separator system is controlled to feed onto the transport system groups of sequential media items having similar information and to separate and feed onto the transport system sequential media items having dissimilar information spaced apart on said transport system from the group of media items having similar destination information. The separator system may be controlled to limit the thickness of each group of media items not to exceed a predetermined thickness. The separator system may also be controlled to separate and feed onto the transport system any subsequent media items which would cause said group of media items to exceed the predetermined thickness. In one arrangement, a series of media items are fed onto the transport system transport path for sortation into two or more sortation bins. The separator is controlled such that adjacent media items destined for the same sortation bin are transported along said transport path as a group of media items to the same sortation bin and such that adjacent media items destined for different sortation bins are separated for separate transport along the transport path to the different sortation bins. The order of the media items within groups created by said separator system may be controlled by an order diverter such that subsequent sortation of groups of media items will further differentiate the media items by media item order sequence of media items in each of the groups of media items. Additional controllable separators may be connected to the media item transport. The system may group media items for unescorted transport on a sorter or may group media items for escorted transport such as by being place in a carrier.

The coded speech data is then provided to a CRC module 27, where error correction data is added before the resulting data is encrypted by an encryption module 22. The resulting encrypted data is transmitted using a Bluetooth radio interface 24, by which the headset is connected wirelessly to a mobile telephone (Figure 1). Received data is decrypted by a decryption module 23, error corrected by an error correction module 28 and decoded by a decoder 29, with the resulting audio signals then being reproduced at a speaker 30. When a user wants to instigate a telephone call with another telephone, the headset 14 is caused to send a control signal to the mobile telephone instructing it to enter a data mode. A data call is then set up and, once established, the CPU 20 controls the setting up of a 128 bit encryption key which is subsequently used for communications between the headset 14 and a corresponding device associated with the recipient of the call. Encryption and decryption are performed only at the headset 14. This provides increased security since even if the call can be intercepted, the interceptor will need to decrypt the signals before being able to reproduce the audio signals. The encryption key comprises a session key which may be periodically changed by selection of a new key from a catalogue of keys and transmitting the new session key to the recipient in encrypted form.",COURTNEY PETER;;WHITE CHRISTOPHER,COURTNEY PETER;;WHITE CHRISTOPHER;;BAKER ANDREW JOHN,,https://lens.org/011-971-484-730-713,Patent Application,no,11,15,5,10,0,H04M1/6066;;H04K1/00;;H04L1/0061;;H04L63/0428;;H04M2250/02;;H04W84/18;;H04W88/181,H04K1/00;;H04L1/00;;H04L12/56;;H04L29/06;;H04M1/60;;H04W12/02;;H04W84/18;;H04W88/18,H4L LECTS         LECTS;;H4L L201          LECTS;;H4L L209          LECTS;;H4L L213          LECTS;;H4L L215          LECTS;;H4P PDCSP         PDCSP,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A three cone roller bit with rolling cone cutters that are provided with both primary and secondary cutting elements. The primary cutting elements extend outwardly from lands on the outer surface of the cutter body. The secondary cutting elements are disposed within grooves on the cutter body so as to either protrude with its cutting surface from the bottom of the groove or be flush or slightly recessed within it. During normal operation, the primary cutter elements of the rolling cone cutters engage the borehole formation. The secondary cutters do not engage the formation. After substantial wear has occurred to the primary cutter elements, and wear begins to occur to the body of the cone cutters, the secondary cutter elements serve as a secondary cutting structure that engages and cuts into the formation.

The work holder has a tooling pallet with a plurality of openings going from a top surface to a bottom surface. A bullet and a spring are located in each opening and held in place by a plate that slides through a groove in the bottom surface of the tooling pallet to block the openings in the bottom surface. Each spring is positioned between a bullet and the plate. A tablet is placed in a cavity of each bullet and a handle is placed in contact with each tablet. High frequency mechanical vibrations, such as ultrasonic vibrations, are applied to a joint interface between each tablet and bullet until the joint interface reaches a molten state.

[발명의 간단한 설명] [발명의 분야] 본 발명은 일반적으로 무선전화 통신 시스템에 관한 것이며, 특히, 무선전화 통신 시스템에 사용하기 위해 샘플링 클럭 신호를 수시된 데이터 신호로 동기화 하는 방법 및 장치에 관한 것이다. [발명의 배경] 최근의 무선 주파수(RF) 통신의 분야에 있어서, 디지탈 암호화 음성(digitally encrypted voice) 및 고속 데이터 통신(high speed data communication)에 대한 요구가 증가되고 있다. RF 스펙트럼은 본래부터 제한되어지기 때문에, 증가되는 요구를 수용하기 위한 새로운 시스템 개념 및 구조적 특징을 고안해내야 한다. 그러한 시스템 중 하나가 더 높은 효율적 스펙트럼 활용과 증가된 수용 능력을 제공하는 시분할 다중 접근(TDMA) 시스템이다. 그 가장 간단한 형태로서, TDMA 시스템은 단일 RF 채널상에서 최소 두명의 사용자로부터 메시지를 시간상으로 다중화할 수 있는 송신 기지국과, 시간상으로 다중화된 메시지중 적어도 한 메시지를 수용할 수 있는 하나이상의 원격 수신국을 구비하고 있다. 통상, 수신국은 TDMA 메시지를 제 2RF 채널상으로 기지국에 송신할 수 있는 이동 또는 휴대가능한 무선전화기일 수 있다. TDMA 시스템에 있어서는, 대부분의 디지탈 통신 시스템과 같이, 두지점 사이에 전송된 디지탈 데이터를 정확히 복원하기 위해 전송 클럭에 연속하여 동기화되는 수신국에서 기준 클럭을 설정하는 것이 필요하다. 여기에서 이용되는 바와 같은 계속적인 비트 동기화는, 수신된 클럭 신호의 주파수 및 위상이 송신 클럭의 주파수 및 위상을 정확히 트래킹(track)해야 하는 것을 의미한다. 이동 통신 채널에서의 비트 동기화는 주로 다중경로 페이딩(multipath fading)으로 인하여 지속되기 어려울 수 있다. 이동국 및 기지국 클럭간의 드리프트(drift)를 트래킹(tracking)하는데 부가하여, 클럭 복원 메카니즘은 잡음(noise)에 충분히 견딜수 있어야 하며, 그로써 페이딩에 의해 야기된 저하된신호 대 잡음비 기간중에 동기화를 쉽게 잃어버리지 않게 한다. 그러므로 이상적인 TDMA 이동 클럭 복원 회로는 심볼 동기화의 빠른 초기 포착(acquisition)을 가지며, 심한 신호 페이딩 기간중에도 계속해서 베이스 측 클럭과와 동기화를 지속하게 된다. 이제까지 개발되어 왔던 클럭 복원 기술(clock recovery technique)중 하나는 이중 루프 대역폭을 갖는 얼리(early)/레이트(late) 위상 조절 회로를 포함한다. 수신된 데이터 신호로부터의 클럭 포착(acquisition)을 위하여, 시스템은 소정의 포착 대역폭을 가진 제어 루프를 활용한다. 포착 대역폭은 광범위하여 수신된 데이터 신호로부터의 심볼 타이밍의 빠른 포착을 가능하게 한다. 하지만, 넓은 포착 대역폭은 중대한 정상상태 타이밍 지터(jitter)의 결과를 초래한다. 때문에, 보다 밀착한 트랙킹 대역폭이 개선된 정상 상태 실행(performance)을 위해 이용된다. 이러한 이중의 대역폭 접근은, 전환가능한 루프 대역폭은 물론 포착-상태 및 정상 상태 인디케이터(indicator)를 요구하므로 비교적 실행하기 복잡하다. 증가된 실행의 복잡성에 부가하여, 종래의 이중 대역폭을 가진 얼리/레이트 접근은 이와 관련하는 몇가지의 실행상 문제를 가진다. 첫째, 초기 포착이 임의의 잡음 또는 간섭에 의해 야기된 잘못된 로크 지시(false lock indication)에 기인하여 상당히 지연될 수 있다. 둘째, 페이드(fade) 또는 신호 탈락(signal dropout)으로 인하여 동기화를 놓치게 될 경우, 회로가 로크(lock)의 분실을 검출하지 못한다면 재포착은 아주 늦추어지게 될 것이다. 마지막으로, 단지 얼리 및 레이트 위상 조절만을 가지는 것은 비록 다른 문제가 없다고 하더라도 초기 포착의 속도를 근본적으로 제한한다. 따라서, 심볼 타이밍의 빠른 포착 및 간단한 실행을 가진 클럭 복원장치에 대한 필요성이 존재하게 된다. [발명의 요약] 본 발명은 샘플링 클럭 신호를 수신 신호에 동기화시키는 방법을 포함한다. 클럭 복원 방법은 몇몇 클럭 신호를 발생하며, 각 클럭 신호는 유일한 위상(unique phase)을 갖는다. 빠른 초기 포착을 수용하기 위해서, 클럭 신호중 두 신호가 심볼 간격의 반만큼의 위상차를 갖는다. 수신된 데이터 신호의 위상과 각 클럭 신호의 위상간의 차를 나타내는 에러 신호가 발생되며, 이 에러 신호에 의해 결정되는 바와같은 최적의 위상을 가진 샘플링 클럭 신호가 발생된다.",MOTOROLA INC,LAROSA CHRISTOPHER P;;CARRY MICHAEL J;;BAKER JAMES C,,https://lens.org/092-038-084-281-779,Granted Patent,no,0,0,13,13,0,H04L7/0337;;H04L7/0337,H04B7/26;;H04J3/06;;H04L7/00;;H04L7/033;;H04L27/22,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
