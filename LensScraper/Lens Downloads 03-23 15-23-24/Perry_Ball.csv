Lathes.-Relates to automatic lathes which produce a series of articles from a long rod fed into the hollow spindle B. The spindle is fitted with the usual gripping and feeding devices operated by slides Q, T, actuated by cams on a drum U mounted on the shaft C<1>. The cam shaft C<1>, instead of being driven by an independent belt pulley, is driven from the spindle B by the worm gearing D, D<1>, shaft E<1>, spur gearing F', G, and bevel gearing H<1>, K<15>. The worm-wheel is provided with a reservoir z, covered by a plate J', from which oil can run through passages to the teeth of the wheel and to the worm. An oil cup for filling the reservoir is screwed into the plate J<1> at f. The shaping-tool B"" and cutting-off tool C"" are mounted in holders secured to a carriage P<1>, operated by levers K<1>, L<1> and cams N<1>, O<1> on a disc M' on the shaft C<1>. The lever L<1> bears against the boss i<1>, and the lever K<1> against the screw Q<1> for adjusting the travel of the tool B"", the screw Q<1> being clamped in position by a side screw and plug. To prevent the carriage and tool B<11> from advancing too far, an inclined piece on the end of a screw R<1> in the carriage comes in contact with an incline cut in a pin S' inserted in the bed. The pin S<1> is adjustable vertically, to vary the travel of the carriage, by a screw X', a collar on which engages a groove in the pin. An oppositely-inclined surface is formed at another part of the circumference of the pin, which, acting in conjunction with the incline on the screw R<1>, gives another range of adjustments for the travel of the carriage. The lever K<1> may be fitted with a flat spring which would yield when the travel of the carriage P' is stopped before the lever has finished its stroke. The spring is fixed to and surrounds the lower arm of the lever, its position being regulated by a screw.and the contraction of the spring indicated by a pivoted pointer moving over a scale on the lever. Instead of a spring lever, the cam N' may be pressed in its place on the disc M' by an elliptical spring adjusted by a right and left hand screw, threaded through the spring and into the shaft C', the spring being pressed by the screw against two studs on the disc M<1> on each side of the screw. The tool B"" is cylindrical, and its cylindrical shank is clamped in the holder D"" by a vertical screw fitting in the slots j<1> in the carriage P' and forcing a shaped sleeve down on the shank. The holder D<11> can be swivelled on the plate E<11> about the axis of the tool-clamping bolt by a short worm fitting in a recess in the holder and engaging threads formed in a curved groove in the upper surface of the plate E<11>. The work is supported by a steady rest consisting of two square bars M"", N"" with V-shaped ends held in a block L"" adjustably clamped on rods J"", K<11> secured to the frame. The bars M"", N<11 >are adjusted by screws having collars engaging grooves in the bars.",BALL CHARLES PERRY;;GOWDY WILLIS,BALL CHARLES PERRY;;GOWDY WILLIS,,https://lens.org/106-056-971-407-61X,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

NATIONAL RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. 31 May, 1965 [29 May, 1964; 26 Oct., 1964], Nos. 22344/64 and 43518/64. Heading H3T. [Also in Division G4] Transistor bi-stable circuits are composed of two sets of two complementary pairs of Field Effect Transistors connected in series and cross coupled as shown in circuit 13 or 15 of Fig. 2 and having switching means, such as transistor 17, connecting the two circuits. In operation, as a digital storage device (Division G4), the supply voltage + V8 to circuit 15 is decreased in value to render the circuit inoperative and transistor 17 is rendered conductive to impose on circuit 15 the same conditions as maintained in circuit 13, and the supply voltage is increased thus causing circuit 15 to assume the same state as circuit 13. In an alternative arrangement (Fig. 14, not shown) one circuit may be rendered inoperative by open-circuiting one of the crosscoupling paths. The substrate of each transistor may be connected to a source of fixed potential (either 0 volts or V8) as in Figs. 6 to 8 (not shown) to prevent reversal of the drain and source polarities when the circuit is rendered inoperative. The switch connecting the two circuits may comprise one transistor as in Fig. 2 or a pair of complementary transistors connected in parallel as in Fig. 7 (not shown).",NAT RES DEV,BALL ROBERT GEORGE;;PERRY GERALD HORACE;;WOOD JOHN,,https://lens.org/110-122-759-820-201,Granted Patent,no,0,5,2,2,0,G11C11/4023;;G11C11/4096;;G11C11/412;;G11C11/417;;G11C19/28;;H03K3/356104;;H03K3/356104;;G11C19/28;;G11C11/4096;;G11C11/412;;G11C11/4023;;G11C11/417,G11C11/402;;G11C11/4096;;G11C11/412;;G11C11/417;;G11C19/28;;H03K3/356,G4C C1F           -;;G4C C11402A       C11402A;;G4C C11409D       C11409D;;G4C C11412        C11412;;G4C C11417        C11417;;G4C C1928         C1928;;G4C C2E           -;;G4C C2JX          -;;G4C C4A           -;;G4D DCS           CS;;H3T TBRB          TBRB;;H3T T1C1          -;;H3T T1M2P         -;;H3T T2B2          -;;H3T T2B3          -;;H3T T2F1          -;;H3T T2F5          -;;H3T T2J           -;;H3T T2T3F         -;;H3T T2T4          -;;H3T T3X           -;;H3T T4C           -;;H3T T4D           -;;H3T T4G           -;;H3T T4M           -;;H3T T4R           -;;H3T T4S           -;;H3T T5E           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
