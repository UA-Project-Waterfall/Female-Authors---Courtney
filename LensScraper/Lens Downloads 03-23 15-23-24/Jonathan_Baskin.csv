    Menu structures having a balanced, predominantly circular appearance for a graphic user interface (GUI) for a delivery system of multiple categories of digital information content. The menu has two concentric rings having icons arranged along the rings identifying menu choices. The outer menu ring presents choices of categories of digital contents available from the content delivery system, while the inner menu ring presents choices of sub-categories of contents associated with a category. The icons are individually selectable. The categories and subcategories displayed are dynamically determined based on the content available to the user. The GUI system allows a user to select a category and sub-category of digital contents by selecting an icon from the outer and inner menu ring, respectively. In response to each selection, the GUI generates animated effects on the graphic display to highlight the selected item.
