Locks, permutation.-The lock is described with reference to a padlock form, but may be applied to safes &c. It consists of two locking-discs B, B' with divided pins C, C', the discs being capable of rotation on the hub k of a setting-plate or casing K. The upper disc carries a dial plate G with push-buttons g<1> corresponding to the number of pins, and resting on radial springs h, shown in Fig. 2, with the dial plate removed. The arm A' of the bow is connected to the disc B<1> and the arm A to the disc B. A coiled spring M connects the disc B' and the setting-plate K, and tends to separate the arms when the pins are disengaged, the necessary relative motion of the discs being allowed by a pin and slot connection. By depressing only the pins C<1> which form the combination, the divisions of all the pins are brought opposite the meeting surfaces of the discs, allowing the arms to be opened. When closing the lock, the arms are brought together and the two discs then move together relatively to the setting-plate, causing cam cavities k<2> in the latter to restore the combination pins to their locked position. Springs F, F<1>, or their equivalents, act frictionally on the pins to maintain them in any position into which they may be pushed. On releasing the arms, the spring M causes them to slightly separate, causing a tension between the discs. To prevent picking by feeling, a plate N, with projections n, is attached to the setting-plate, so that in the normal locked position, when there is a tension between the discs, the projections n register with the radial springs h and prevent any of the pins being operated. On slightly closing the arms, thus removing the tension, the projections are brought into register with spaces h<1> between the springs, and any pin can be depressed without disclosing the combination. The depression of an idle pin locks the discs and necessitates a re-setting before the lock can be opened. The ends of the arms interlock to prevent separation of the parts.",CLARKE HENRY,CLARKE HENRY,,https://lens.org/092-929-262-188-307,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Circular knitting-machines.-Relates to machines with latch needles and oscillating needle cams and thread-carriers and fixed needle cylinders, and the object of the invention is to fashion pant. legs, shirt sleeves, &c. by throwing the thread-carrier out of or into action, and so to vary the number of needles fed at either or both selvages and to splice the fabric at any part. Any number of articles can be made on one machine. The cam ring c, Fig. 10, has a fixed uptbrow c', a sliding down-throw c<3> operated by the needles themselves, and two vertically-sliding switch cams c<4>; its outer rim is toothed, and it is oscillated by being geared up to a slide which is operated by a rocking lever d<2>, link d<1>, and crank-wheel d geared to the main shaft. A bracket on the ring works between a pair of projections on, and so operates, the sinker cam. The sinkers slide horizontally in tricks in a ring e<1>. The splicing-thread carrier f <3> and the main carrier f<1>are pivoted to a bracket f carried by the cam ring. A spring tends to draw the splicing- carrier into the operative position ; a friction washer causes the main carrier to stay in any position in which it is put. The latch guard f <8> is slotted to allow the carriers to move to the inoperative position. A fixed cam f<9> acts on a truck f<5> on the heel of the splicing-carrier, and, according as it is shaped, causes the carrier to splice at any part. A similar truck on the heel of the main thread-carrier f<1> is acted on by two cams g<1>, one at each end of the stroke ; these cams are carried by rings working in a groove in the bed. These rings are moved in opposite directions by pinions g<4>, g<5> and ratchet-wheels g<7>, each of which is acted on by a pair of pawls carried by a slide operated by a rocking lever g<14> and cam g<13> ; the pawls are put in or out of action by bluffs operated through a link g<11> from the pattern chain o. The threads h, k pass from spools h<1>, k<1> through eyes k<2> and feeding-tubes, under pivoted shoes k<4>, over the spring take-up k<5> or h<5>, and down through eyes k<6> to the carriers. When a catch i<6> is released, by means of the link i<7>, lever i<8>, i<9>, and a pattern lug, the spring-actuated slide i<3> is set free, and the splicing-thread is cut between the fixed blade i<1> and the movable blade i<2>. The pattern chain o has lugs of two different heights, and passes round adjustable pulleys o' and fixed pulleys o‹ and round a pulley actuated by a ratchet-wheel and pawl operated by a cam and lever. The bits act on levers, pivoted at o<8>, which control the fashioning and yarn delivering. One lever o<9> acts through a link l<4>, and disengages a lever l<1> from a notch in a bar l; the bar l, when released, is pulled by a spring, and shifts the belt on to the loose pulley. The stop-motion may be operated by hand. When a pattern lever is operated, a pivoted lever o<13> will hold it in place until a further lug operates another lever o<10>, and so puts the hold-out lever o<13> out of gear. This lever o<10> may be operated by hand, and may put the pawl of the pattern-driving ratchet-wheel out of gear, so that the chain can be moved by hand.",CLARKE HENRY,CLARKE HENRY,,https://lens.org/082-066-802-032-423,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Couplings, automatic.-At each end of the vehicle, a trumpet-shaped tube C and a bar D, having a slot E, are connected to a cross-bar A of the usual spring-controlled draw-bar B, a crossrod L ensuring strength and rigidity. A bent lever F, pivoted to the tube C, carries at one end a short rod G hanging through, and capable of a rocking motion in, slots H in the tube C. When two vehicles come together, the bar D of one vehicle enters the tube C of the other, the rods G ride on the top of the bars D, fall into the slots E, and, on the rebound of the vehicle, assume a vertical position and engage with the lower slots H. Uncoupling is effected by lifting the short rods G, preferably by means of a bar I having handles J and a crank K engaging the other end of the lever F. The bars D have a free side movement to facilitate coupling and uncoupling on curved portions of the railway. The usual draw-bar hook is preferably situated between the tube C and the rod D, for use with wagons not fitted with this device.",CLARKE HENRY,CLARKE HENRY,,https://lens.org/173-081-839-042-857,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Circular knitting - m a - chines. -Relates to improvements on the invention described in Specifications No. 18,644, A.D. 1892, and No. 8559, A.D. 1895. The c a m ring and thread-guides are rotated or reciprocated by means of a clutch which connects a shaft either with a bevel - wheel or with a spur-wheel. The bevel-wheel is geared to the driving-shaft direct, but the spur-wheel is in gear with a rack constantly reciprocated by a. crank and wheel. The clutch, is moved by an arm on a shaft 50 having a frame 51 in which works a cam 52 on a shaft 53 rotated by a ratchetwheel 63 and pawl 56 on a constantly-reciprocated arm 55. During rotary knitting the pawl 56 strikes a projection 58 and is lifted out of gear with its wheel 63, and the shaft 53 is at rest. When reciprocating knitting is required, a lug on the pattern chain acts through levers and moves the projection 58, and allows the shaft 53 to be rotated and the shaft 50 and consequently the clutch to be moved. The wheel 63 moves three teeth, after which the fashioning-mechanism acts through a lever 64 to raise a bluff 65 which stops any further motion ; at the same time a lever raises a pawl and stops the pattern chain. When the fashioning is completed, the fashioning-mechanism returns the bluff to its normal position, and the shaft 53 is again rotated and the clutch moved. A falling lever then racks the pattern chain one link, and the parts come to their normal position. The needle cylinder is raised during the knitting of heel, toe, and calf by the usual incline and lever arrangement operated from a subsidiary pattern chain, the actuating ratchet-wheel having a long tooth making the pawl inactive till the pattern chain is racked one tooth by means of a lever and lug on the main pattern chain. The main thread-carrier 1 is pivoted at 1<a>, and the striping-carriers 2, 3, 4 at 2<a>, to a bracket 5 hinged to a bracket 5"" on the wheel 6. which also carries the usual cam ring 8.. The tails of the carriers are acted on by cams 1<c> on shafts 1<d> having notched wheels 1<e> and springs 1<f> to ensure the proper amount of rotation and starwheels 1<g>. Inclines raised and lowered by levers acted on by lugs on the pattern chain act on the star-wheels, and throw one carrier into action and another out of action at the same time. The yarn is thrown in at the left-hand side of a particular needle, while the last yarn is thrown out at the right-hand side of the same needle. The inactive yarns wrap around guides 95, 94 carried by arms on the brackets 5 ; the guide 94 prevents twisting of the yarns between the carrier eyes and itself, and so allows each thread to be fed without dragging another with it.",CLARKE HENRY,CLARKE HENRY,,https://lens.org/021-489-228-149-302,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

[Also in Group XXXI] In an inflatable object, e.g. an airship or aeroplane wing or part of a dinghy, having at least two interior surface portions 2 which are displaced away from each other as a result of inflating the object, at least one of the two portions has a loop 5 through which a cord 7 or wire or the like freely passes, the cord being attached also to the other of said portions in such a way that when the object is inflated the cord tautens and restrains the relative displacement of said portions to an extent depending upon the effective length chosen for said cord. In the embodiment of Fig. 1, lengths of tape 3 placed between an outer panel 1 and an inner panel 2 are pulled through slots 4 in the latter to form the loops 5.

Clarke, W. H. Oct. 31. Brakes.-Relates to automatic air brakes, and consists in providing a special valve which, by reducing the pressure in the brake cylinder to a predetermined limit, presents the skidding of the wheels as the train slows down, no matter how hard the brakes have been applied originally. The Figure shows the valve as placed between the auxiliary cylinder C and a standard Westing- house triple valve. When the brakes are applied, air passes through the passage c and past the valve d<2> to the triple valve, and thence by the passage B to a pipe b leading to the brake cylinder. Air flows from the passage B by the duct a to the interior of the valve d<3>, and thence through openings in the parts d<4> and d<9> to the diaphragm d<1>. This diaphragm is about one-third larger than the other d, so that both are moved to the right to close the valve d<2> and open the valve d'. Air can then escape slower from the brake cylinder to the atmosphere through the port a<1>, until the pressure is about 40 lbs. to the square inch, the leverage of the rigging being altered to suit. When the pressure in the brake cylinder is sufficiently reduced, the pressure on the diaphragm d moves both diaphragms to the left, and closes the valve d<3>. The valve d<2>, however, owing to its connection with the diaphragm, remains closed.",CLARKE WILLIAM HENRY,CLARKE WILLIAM HENRY,,https://lens.org/053-209-427-839-076,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The apparatus is primarily intended for use in surgical operations on the brain, the instrument employed being described in Specification 22,455/12. The position of the point is defined by the usual x, y, z co-ordinates and three surfaces A, B, C are provided graduated by parallel lines to enable a pointer, preferably a star-shaped body 0 formed by the intersection of three wires parallel to the axes, to be set. The pointer is mounted on a graduated arm d carried by a graduated upright d' sliding in a block D<1>, which slides on a scale parallel to the remaining axes. Instead of three graduated planes, two may be employed, one with two sets of graduations at right-angles. The planes are preferably grids of wire or thread, and may be made adjustable, as shown in Fig. 7, to facilitate exact settings of scale. A convenient arrangement of grids composed of rods with scale variable by parallelogrammatic displacement of the framework is shown in Fig. 12, the indicating star 0 being carried at a known distance above a block R sliding on a pair of rods attached to blocks sliding on arms P<1>, P<2>. The blocks have pins to enclose the graduating rods, and the arms P<1>, P<2> are secured to spring-controlled sleeves on a sleeve sliding on a pillar N supporting the system of planes. A methol of mounting the graduation bars of the planes so as to allow of scalar adjustment is shown in Fig. 11.

Cocoa preparations.-A preparation adapted for use in cases of dyspepsia consists of triturated cocoa beans, banana flour, milk powder, and malt extract. The bananas are peeled and the pulp is cut into strips, which are dried by exposure first to the sun and then to a current of hot air, reduced to a granular form, further dried by hot air, and finally ground to flour and sifted. The aroma lost is restored by bringing into contact with the granular material during desiccation, or with the powdered material during sifting, the vapour of the essential oil preferably obtained by subjecting the peel, either fresh or preserved in alcohol, to a pressure of 3-4 atmospheres and a temperature of 30‹ C. When the pressure is reduced to half an atmosphere, the ethers distil off and the essential oil is left. For making tablets, the banana flour is mixed with milk powder and malt extract, ground cocoa containing all its fat is then incorporated, and sugar is added, but for making powder or compressed cakes the cocoa is mixed with liquid, condensed, or dry milk, dried, ground, and mixed with the banana flour. Violent action during grinding and incorporation is avoided, to preserve the nitrogenous products in their natural state.",CLARKE FRANK HENRY LAVANCHY,CLARKE FRANK HENRY LAVANCHY,,https://lens.org/120-620-084-468-08X,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Pressurized washing liquid (111) is delivered under the force of gravity or a hydrostatic head from a wash liquid reservoir (112). The wash liquid reservoir includes both wash liquid and gas (113) supplied from a filtrate reservoir. The gas/liquid interface in the wash liquid reservoir is hydraulically disposed above the top of the washer vat (102) to thereby provide a hydrostatic head between the wash liquid reservoir and the washer vat. The interface is monitored and used to control the speed of the rotating drum. In the event the gas/liquid interface rises above a predetermined optimum value for the current operating speed of the drum, the speed of the drum is increased in order to avoid mat collapse and optimize washing efficiency. In the event the gas/liquid interface drops below a predetermined optimum level, the speed of the drum is reduced to increase washing efficiency.",BELOIT TECHNOLOGIES INC,CLARKE-POUNDER IAN JAMES HENRY,,https://lens.org/008-093-319-498-848,Patent Application,yes,5,0,2,2,0,D21C9/06,D21C9/06,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Protective arrangements; electric currents, converting &c. GENERAL ELECTRIC CO. Ltd. Aug. 24, 1962 [Aug. 24, 1961], No. 30562/61. Headings H2F and H2K. A power supply circuit including a semiconductor controlled inverter is provided with a thermal relay THB arranged to be energized when a switch 5 in series with the inverter is closed, a relay C to interrupt the operating circuit of the thermal relay (at C2) when A.C. is produced at the output side of the inverter, and means 15 to open the switch 5 when the thermal relay is operated if A.C. is not produced before the end of the timing period of the thermal relay. When the switch 5 is closed, a relay D closes contacts D1 to complete the circuit for a transistor oscillator, Fig. 3, controlling the inverter, a thermal relay THA closes contacts THAI to energize a relay E, and a relay A closes contacts A1. The relay E closes contacts E2 to complete the circuit for a contactor B and opens contacts E1 to deenergize the relays THA and A. The contactor B closes its contacts 9, 10 to complete the supply circuit to the inverter. As soon as the inverter supplies A.C., the relay C closes contacts C1 to maintain the contactor B energized and opens contacts C2 to open the circuits of the relays A, THA and THB. If relay C does not operate before relay A releases, contactor B opens. Subsequently, the thermal relay THA recloses its contacts THAI to re-energize the relay E so that the sequence of operation is repeated. If, after the contactor B has been closed three times, the relay C has not operated, the thermal relay THB closes its contacts THB1 to energize an electromagnet 15 to trip open the switch 5. A further thermal relay THC providing a longer time delay is controlled by the contacts 16 of a relay connected across the inverter output circuit. A rectifier 6 prevents operation should the circuit be connected with the wrong polarity. The inverter, Fig. 2, comprises two pairs of silicon controlled rectifiers 15A. . . 15D, the rectifiers of each pair being connected in series and* the pairs being connected between a negative input terminal 16 and the ends of a centre-tapped transformer primary winding 21. Each rectifier is shunted by a resistor 27 and a resistor 28 and a capacitor 29 in series so that transients in the D.C. supply are equally divided between the rectifiers of each pair. Rectifier elements 33, 34 improve the regulation characteristics of the inverter. The gating signals for the rectifiers 15A ... 15D are derived from a voltage regulator 5 and a transistor oscillator 4, Fig. 3, comprising transistors 46, 47 and a transformer 48 interconnected in the manner described in Specification 857,775, The transformer 48 has an additional primary winding 49 to which a synchronizing A.C. may be supplied by way of a transformer 50.

[Also in Division G3] The electric inverter system described in Specification 958,947 includes a series output voltage regulator, the impedance of which increases if the output voltage falls to an abnormally low value, e.g. under short circuit conditions. The output voltage is automatically maintained constant under normal conditions by a series transductor 56 having a control winding 60 which is energized by an error signal derived from a circuit including transistors 73, 76. The output voltage is applied to the primary winding 66 of a transformer 65; a voltage proportional to this output voltage is derived from a secondary winding 68, is rectified and smoothed, and is applied over a potentiometer 72 to the base of transistor 73 which, together with a reference Zener diode 74 acts as a comparator to deliver an error signal which is applied by way of transistor 76 to the control winding 60, whereby the impedance of transductor 56 is varied in dependence upon output voltage variations. If, however, the output voltage falls to a very low value, positive feedback provided by a winding 59 causes the impedance of transductor 56 to increase, whereby a finite load impedance is presented to the inverter which is thus protected against an excessive load current. The feedback winding 59 is connected to a rectifier circuit 63 so that it is energized by a rectified portion of the output of the inverter system. A circuit utilizing silicon controlled rectifiers may replace the transductor' 56.

In, for example, a multi-contact plug-andsocket unit, adapted for use as a hand-operated switch, the plug member (Figs. 1, 3) comprises a plurality of strip contacts 12, housed in grooves in the curved side of an approximately D-shaped contact carrying portion (see Fig. 3) connected to a cylindrical neck 32 and shoulder portion 31, contact wires 13 passing up through the plug member, to connect with the respective strip contacts 12. The socket member (Figs. 4, 6) comprises a cylindrical contact carrier 21, having a cylindrical bore 22 opening into one of larger diameter 23 (see Fig. 6), resilient strip contacts 25, captive in the sides of the member, being placed across the junction of the bores. In use the plug member is inserted into the slightly larger bore 22 of the socket member until stopped by the top 34 and the neck 32 of the plug member, meeting the socket end plate 37 and segmental web 29 in the threaded socket bush 28, respectively. The plug member is twisted clockwise until stopped by the flat side of the top part 34 of the plug member, meeting the face 40 of a right-angled projection in a bore in upper socket member 36, thereby forcing the socket contacts back, as in Fig. 6, making simultaneous electrical contact between all of the plug-and-soket contacts.

A gas turbine comprising a combustion chamber having a tubular or annular flame tube mounted in spaced relationship within an air casing having an inlet at one end to which air can be supplied from a compressor to flow both within and around the flame tube, is characterized in that the downstream end of the latter is of tapering form and is provided with peripheral openings, whilst the downstream end of the air casing, which is connected to the turbine, surrounds the tapering portion of the flame tube in such relationship that air flowing around the flame tube will cause products of combustion within the flame tube to be extracted through the openings to be entrained with this air. An air casing 2 has an inlet 3 connected to a compressor and an outlet 4 connected to a turbine. A flame tube 1, mounted within an air casing 2, is provided with a burner 8 surrounded by an air swirler 9 and has apertures 6 for the flow of combustion air to the combustion zone within a frusto-conical portion 5. A corrugated ring 11 mounted between the portion 5 and a casing 10 forms an annular inlet through which cooling air enters the casing 10. Air from the annular inlet is directed around lips 13 and apertures 12 in the casing 10 which is also provided with outwardly flanged apertures 14 and has a central opening at its downstream end. A shell 15 is secured within the air casing 2 to provide a space through which cooling air can flow.

Roundabouts.-Roundabouts are constructed so that the cars receive a similar motion to cars moving on a circular switchback track, but the cars are suspended by means of wires from a rotating frame, and the vertical motion of the cars is obtained by drawing the suspending-wires n and out by means of an eccentric. Each car K is suspended from a jib J, supported by spars B, G, by means of two wire ropes H, one at each end of the car, each rope H being provided with a ring L, from which are suspended two ropes attached respectively to the front end of one car and the rear of the adjacent car. The spars B are attached to a plate S which moves round with the sbaft A. The shaft A is driven by means of a band U formed in two halves capable of being adjusted by means of bolts and springs so as to engage a friction drum T, fixed to the plate S. The band V is connected to the main driving-wheel W, loosely mounted on the shaft A and driven by suitable power. The rotation of the shaft A drives an eccentric E, loosely mounted on the shaft, through the operation of bevelwheels D, 0, M, the last being loosely mounted on an arm N fixed to the shaft A. This gearing causes the eccentric E to revolve in the opposite direction to the shaft A. The gearing may be arranged so that the eccentric revolves at a different rate from the shaft A. The eccentric E is surrounded by a ring or strap R running on rollers, and the ropes H, which are suitably guided by pulleys &c., are attached to the strap R, so that, for each revolution of the eccentric E, the cars K rise and fall through a certain distance. The cars K are guided in their vertical motions by rods Q attached to the beams C, which are connected to the cars by means of pins Z, about which the cars oscillate. The rods Q move through guides V on the spars G, and serve to prevent the cars from moving outwards by centrifugal force.",CLARKE WILLIAM HENRY;;WRIGHT ROBERT WILLIAM,CLARKE WILLIAM HENRY;;WRIGHT ROBERT WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/151-804-137-460-200,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

METROPOLITANVICKERS ELECTRICAL CO., Ltd. July 6, 1955 [July 16, 1954], No. 20823/54. Class 39(1). The centre electrode of a double spark gap is formed in two parts B1 and B2 connected together through a condenser C1 and resistor R3 and each part has an associated triggering electrode P 1 or P 2 . The parts B 1 and B 2 are connected to the mid-point of a potential divider R 1 R 2 which is connected between the outer electrodes A and C. A positive pulse generated at the mid-point of the potential divider by a pulse transformer T is applied between the coupling condenser C1 and the electrode P 2 causing breakdown of P 2 B 2 and then, as condenser C 1 charges up, P 1 B 1 . If C is positive with respect to A gap AB 1 breaks down followed by gap CB 2 . If C is negative with respect to A gap CB2 breaks down followed by gap AB 1 . The arrangement may be connected as a triggering device in the first stage of an impulse generator and ensures that when the generator polarity is reversed there is always an outer electrode which is negative with respect to the centre electrode and facing a triggering- electrode which is positive with respect to its associated electrode, which are the optimum conditions when triggering a spark gap. The spark-gap is designed to operate in still air at atmospheric pressure but may be enclosed in an envelope filled with gas at a pressure greater than atmospheric. Spark quenching means such as an air blast may also be provided. The centre electrode, Fig. 2, comprises two hemispheres 1, 2 for example of copper fitted with molybdenum inserts 3, 4 having central holes 5, 6 through which project molybdenum triggering rods 7, 8 held in brass bushings 9, 10 attached by screws, which are preferably staggered to prevent electrical breakdown, to an insulating disc 11 for example of ebonite to which the hemispheres 1, 2 are also attached. The triggering rods 7, 8 are surrounded by glass tubes 12, 13 which are ground at one end and fastened at the other end by wax to the brass bushings 9, 10. A resistor 14 and condenser 15 are connected inside the electrode so that only the two connections to the pulse transformer are brought out via channels in the disc 11.

E., and Clarke, W. E. Jan. 24, 1918. Ploughs.-Tractor ploughs, in which the side wheels are mounted on crank-axles on parallel crank-shafts, are adapted to be raised and lowered by means of a member mounted loosely on one of the crank-shafts and geared to and rotating with the corresponding side wheel, means being provided for locking the rotating member to the crankshaft when required, for connecting the two crankshafts together so that the angular movement of the one is communicated in reduced degree to the other, and for simultaneously tilting the standard of the rear wheel. The crank-shafts A<2>, B<2> are furnished with arms D, D' connected by a link D<2>, the effective length of the arm D being variable. The axle A<1> of the land-wheel A is carried by a disk C on the shaft A<2>. A brake-drum F is mounted loosely on the shaft A<2> and is connected to the wheel A by chain gearing. The plough is raised by locking the drum F to the disk C by means of a brake-band H actuated by means of a lever J<2> and cord J<3> and provided with a stud H' to enter a recess in the drum F. The brake is released, when the plough is raised, by the lever J<2> coming into contact with a guide-pulley E<3>, A clutch may be substituted for the brake-drum F and band H, and the wheel may have grips on its periphery to prevent skidding. A duplicate locking arrangement may be provided to allow of the plough being lowered by reversing the tractor; or a pivoted and spring-controlled tipping-lever K, K<1> may be provided to throw the cranks back over their vertical centres, so as to allow the plough to fall under its own weight. The lever K, K' is actuated by means of a cord K<3> and engages a roller L on the arm D<1>. The depth of furrow is varied by adjusting a stop-piece D<4>, which engages with a frame-stay E' when the plough is lowered. The socket N for the standard M<2> of the rear wheel M is pivoted on a horizontal pivot N', and is tilted by a lever 0 connected to the arm D by a link P. A stop N<3> limits the move. ment when the plough is run back. The wheel M is of the self-steering type It is always returned to its normal track position by a spring-actuated plunger R engaging a flat face on a collar R' on the standard M<2>.",CRAWLEY CORNELIUS HENRY;;STARKEY MARCUS EDWARD;;CLARKE WILLIAM ERNEST,CRAWLEY CORNELIUS HENRY;;STARKEY MARCUS EDWARD;;CLARKE WILLIAM ERNEST,,https://lens.org/096-263-798-739-338,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,A01B63/18,A01B63/18,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The heat exchanger has alternating first and second passages and a reservoir located above the first and second passages for receiving a first fluid and for containing a froth. A series of orifices can be provided by a distributor tray to provide flow communication between the reservoir and the first passages to allow at least a liquid phase of the froth to weep into the first passages and to be partly vaporized through indirect heat exchange with a second fluid flowing through the second passages. The partial vaporization produces a vapor phase of the froth which can at least in part escape from the orifices and interact with the first fluid to thereby form the froth. A remaining part of the liquid phase, not vaporized through the indirect heat exchange, is discharged from the bottom of the first passages into a sump. The weeping inlet of the liquid phase into the first passages allows for the automatic replenishment of the first passages due to flow mal-distribution.",BOC GROUP INC,SATCHELL JR DONALD PRENTICE;;NATARAJAN VENKAT;;CLARKE RICHARD HENRY,,https://lens.org/037-679-968-760-850,Granted Patent,yes,5,6,6,6,0,F25J3/04412;;F25J5/002;;F25J3/04412;;F25J3/04793;;F25J3/04793;;F25J5/005;;F25J2250/04;;F25J2250/04;;F25J2290/32;;F25J2290/32;;F28D9/0068;;F28D9/0068;;F28D2021/0033;;F28D2021/0033,F25J5/00;;B01D3/16;;B01D3/22;;B01D3/26;;F25J3/00;;F25J3/04;;F28D9/00,202/154;;165/166;;62/643,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    Self-validating (SEVA) sensors implemented in a control process provide various metrics regarding sensed variables to a central control unit. Specifically, SEVA sensors provide measurements of the variables and validity information about the measurements, which may include fault information about the sensors themselves. A control unit utilizes the various SEVA metrics even when large numbers of SEVA sensors are used, a situation that is otherwise problematic due to difficulties in assimilating data from multiple SEVA sensors. Accordingly, the control unit distinguishes sensor faults from actual process changes, and responds as needed, even when large numbers of SEVA sensors are implemented together. Specifically, the monitoring and control unit assimilates signals from multiple SEVA sensors using a multi-variate statistical analysis, and compares results of this analysis with a model characterizing behavior of the process (where the model may take into account actuator position information) and/or historical statistical data.

A digital drive signal generator is adapted to generate a variable digital drive signal for controlling operation of the driver. The digital drive signal generator can be adapted to cause the driver to resist motion of the flowtube during a first time period and amplify motion of the flowtube during a second time period. The digital drive signal generator can also be adapted to initiate motion of the flowtube by sending one or more square wave signals to the driver.","Invensys Systems, Inc.",Manus P. Henry;;David W.

An active drive system 39, 21 may drive the holding members and may thereby also actively drive the further member into place. Alternatively the active drive 39, 21 may drive another member such as a locking member 31 to hold the retaining members 19, 27 in position once the further member is in place. The active drive releases the retaining members 19, 27 or moves them out of position to allow the further member to be removed. This allows the further member to be inserted and removed with a lower force than is used to hold it in place. The coupling may also be used for in-air recovery of an unmanned aircraft.

SOLUTION: In a digital flowmeter 100, a vibratable conduit is contained, a drive circuit 115 which is connected to the conduit and which can be operated so as to give a motion to the conduit is contained, and a sensor 110 which is connected to the conduit and which can be operated so as to detect the motion of the conduit is contained. A digital controller 105 is connected across the drive circuit 115 and the sensor 110. The digital controller 105 contains a circuit, and the circuit receives a sensor signal from the sensor 110. A drive signal, which is based on the sensor signal, is generated by using a digital signal processing operation. The drive signal is output to the drive circuit 115. On the basis of the signal from the sensor 110, the measured value of the characteristic of a material flowing in the conduit is generated.",FOXBORO CO,HENRY P MANUS;;CLARKE W DAVID;;VIGNOS H JAMES,,https://lens.org/002-455-618-513-769,Patent Application,no,0,3,21,94,0,G01F1/8404;;G01F1/8431;;G01F1/8436;;G01F1/8486;;G01N2009/006;;G01F25/10;;G01F1/8404;;G01F1/8436;;G01N2009/006;;G01F1/8486;;G01F1/8431;;G01F25/10,G01F1/00;;G01F1/76;;G01F1/84,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The system monitors the mechanical continuity of the drive train by comparing the number of revolutions of the prime mover with the number of revolutions made by the cable drum in the same time interval. The system actuates a caliper disc brake mounted with the drum if a discontinuity of the drive train is detected. In the electrica system, shaft encoders are used on both the cable drum axle and prime mover shaft. The cable drum encoder is selected such that the number of pulses it produces per revolution of the cable drum is approximately equal to the number of pulses produced by prime mover shaft encoder per revolution of its shaft divided by the speed reduction ratio of the drive train. The counters in the comparator are periodically reset to prevent the slight difference in the number of pulses produced by the encoders during normal operations from falsely indicating a drive train discontinuity. In the mechanical system, the prime mover shaft and cable drum axle may be connected to a mechanical phase sensing switch through respective rotation transmitting cables in order to determine if the cable drum and prime mover are rotating at the drive train speed reduction ratio.",EDERER INC,ALBRECHT HENRY R;;CLARKE C WILLIAM;;LONGTHORPE PAUL L;;MILLER GREGORY C,EDERER INCORPORATED (1981-12-03),https://lens.org/040-127-336-448-028,Granted Patent,yes,6,57,1,1,0,B66D1/54;;B66D1/54;;B66D5/14;;B66D5/14;;B66D5/30;;B66D5/30,B66D5/14;;B66D5/30,254173000R,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

F., and Read, R. H. Dec. 10, 1918. Limbs, artificial.-Comprises a construction of hand of the type in which the fingers are spring- closed and are opened by a reciprocating slide arranged so that the hand cannot be opened by pressure applied between the fingers and, thumb. The invention consists in the general arrangement and construction of the operating-mechanism, one of the main features of which is the provision of one or more inclined slots in the slide engaging with cranks forming extensions of the fingers or fingers and thumb. The first and second fingers 24, 25 are pivoted on a, shaft 5a fitted with two crank-arms 6, 7. The crank 6 engages the slot in the slide 10, so that when the slide is drawn rearwardly by the cord 11 against the action of the spring 19, the fingers are opened. This movement results in the simultaneous rotation of the crank 7, which opens the thumb through the medium of the slotted tail-piece 15. The angle of the slot in the slide is arranged! so that pressure applied between the thumb and fingers cannot force the slide rearwardly to open the hand. The slide is restored by the spring 19 when released, to enable the fingers and thumb to take a three-point grip on an object. The whole of the operating-mechanism can be built up as a complete unit on a plate 3 before the plate is fixed in the body of the hand. In some case, the slide may be furnished with a second slot for direct actuation of the thumb. The third and fcurth fingers may be spring-controlled in any convenient manner.",ANDERSON WILLIAM PURVES;;CLARKE NORMAN CARLYLE;;WHITELAW JOHN FALCONER;;READ RICHARD HENRY,ANDERSON WILLIAM PURVES;;CLARKE NORMAN CARLYLE;;WHITELAW JOHN FALCONER;;READ RICHARD HENRY,,https://lens.org/103-508-572-395-768,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,A61F2/583,A61F2/58,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

[Also in Group XXXVIII] A magnetic tape recorder is adaptable to play disc gramophone records in addition by plugging in a gramophone pick-up 35 and a three-armed turntable 25 driven from the same motor 51 which drives the capstan 52, the opposite ends 69, 71 of the motor spindle driving the turntable and capstan, respectively. Both the capstan and turntable are rotatable at two different speeds by concentrically arranged controls 21, 20, respectively, mounted centrally on the front panel 3 of the machine. The turntable shaft 11 is also arranged symmetrically between the supply and take-up spool positions. The control 20 is movable to a 45 or 33 r.p.m. setting and moves an idler disc 86,via a control shaft 89 and linkage 92, 95, 83, 84, 85, to engage a step 70 or 71 of the motor spindle and drive a disc 66 mounted on the bottom end of the turntable shaft 11. Automatic stopping means (not detailed) operated in normal manner by the pick-up engaging the run-out groove on a record is preferably arranged to stop the turntable in the Fig. 1 position so that tape spools can be loaded and unloaded without having to remove the turntable. The control 21 is movable to a 3¥ or 7¢ ins./sec. setting and moves an idler disc 113, via a plate 150 and linkage 107, 108, 110, to engage a stepped wheel 118 mounted on the motor spindle 69, and a flywheel 53 on the capstan shaft 52.

A vehicle comprises a weight estimator, which receives input from different vehicle systems and/or sensors (e.g., suspension, powertrain, speedometer, tire pressure monitoring system) and uses these inputs to determine weight values associated with the vehicle (e.g., total weight, weight distribution per axle, weight distribution per wheel, load distribution). These weight values are then used by the power train, brakes, and/or suspension as additional input for operating these systems besides drivers' input, e.g., provided as pedal positions. For example, different weight values can cause different powertrain outputs for the same accelerator pedal position, e.g., greater output for a heavier vehicle.
