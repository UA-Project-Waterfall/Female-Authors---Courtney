Electromagnetic mixing. BRITISH IRON & STEEL RESEARCH ASSOCIATION. 17 Feb., 1970 [17 Feb., 1969], No. 8446/69. Heading B1C. [Also in Divisions B3 and H5] In a method and apparatus for stirring mutually immiscible electrically conductive fluids, an electric current is passed through the interface between the fluids and a magnetic field is arranged to generate oppositely directed forces in the region of the interface. As described, in an electroslag refining process a consumable electrode furnace has a non- magnetic container 1 with superimposed layers of molten metal 3 and liquid slag 4 into the latter of which dips the electrode 5 from which current passes to the baseplate 2. A coil 11 embraces the container at the level of the interface between the metal and slag and its field 2 interacts with the current in the fluids to generate forces tending to rotate the slag and metal in opposite directions 13, 14. The coil and electrode are vertically adjustable. In modifications the magnetic field intensity may be varied by an adjustable transformer (15, 16, Fig. 3, not shown) or resistor (17, Fig. 4, not shown); there may be two coils with their fields opposed to give an increased stirring effect on a plane which may be located in the slag layer immediately above the interface (Fig. 5, not shown); three coils may be used to produce increased stirring action in both layers (Fig. 6, not shown); a parallelepipedal container may have electro-magnets or coils at opposite faces to give a stirring action in vertical planes (Figs. 7 and 8, not shown). Alternating or direct current may be used and the electro-magnets of Fig. 7 may be replaced by permanent magnets.",BRITISH IRON STEEL RESEARCH,CAMPBELL JOHN,,https://lens.org/190-894-460-744-453,Granted Patent,no,0,1,4,4,0,H02K44/04;;H05B6/34;;H05B2213/02;;H05B6/34;;H05B2213/02;;H02K44/04,H02K44/04;;H05B6/34,B1C CPJA          CPJA;;B1C C125          CPJA;;B1C C312          CPJA;;B1C C34X          C34Z;;B1C C418          CPJA;;B1C C435          CPJA;;B1C C502          CPJA;;B3F F13AX4        F13A;;B3F F13AX9        F13A;;B3F F13A6A        F13A;;B3F F13A6B        F13A;;H5H H2S2          H2S2,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The stirring is produced by passing an electric current through the melt in the presence of a stationary magnetic field and is such that the melt in one plane rotates in one direction whilst the melt in an adjacent plane rotates in the opposite direction thus producing sufficient turbulence between the planes to break up dendritic growth. In an electroslag refining process, a consumable steel electrode 3 is fused into a molten slag bath within a cylindrical mould 17 of non-magnetic material. The mould 17 is cooled by a water-spray or cooling jacket and rests upon a water-cooled stool 2. An electric current is passed from the electrode 3 to the stool 2 but the mould 17 is insulated from the stool to ensure vertical current flow. About the central portion of the stool is a magnetic field producing coil 4 which may or may not be connected in series with the electrode current supply. Both the coil 4 and the electrode 3 are vertically movable on screwjacks 6, 7, 8, 9. The metal above and below the coil 4 rotates in opposite directions 15, 16. The coil 4 is moved upwards as electrode melting proceeds. The process can also be applied to vacuum arc refining apparatus using a consumable electrode and to directional solidification apparatus where the melt is heated by current from a non- consumable electrode.",BRITISH IRON STEEL RESEARCH,CAMPBELL JOHN,,https://lens.org/078-481-358-407-308,Granted Patent,no,0,11,1,1,0,B22D27/02,B22D27/02,B1C CPJA          CPJA;;B1C C125          CPJA;;B1C C34A          C34Z;;B1C C34X          C34Z;;B1C C418          CPJA;;B1C C435          CPJA;;B1C C502          CPJA;;B3F FCM           FCM;;B3F F11S          FZ2;;B3F F11U          FZ2;;B3F F13AX4        F13A;;B3F F13AX9        F13A;;B3F F13A6A        FZ2;;B3F F13A6A        F22;;B3F F13A6B        FZ2;;B3F F13A6B        F22;;B3F F13A6C3       FZ2;;B3F F13A6C3       F22;;B3F F13A6F        FZ2;;B3F F13A6F        F22;;B3F F224          FCM;;H5H H2A2C1        H2Z;;H5H H2A3          H2Z;;H5H H2A5          H2Z;;H5H H2A6          H2Z;;H5H H2S1          H2Z;;H5H H2S2          H2Z,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

PARKE:R APPLIANCE CO. March 31, 1953, No. 8818/53. Class 7(3) [Also in Group XI] A fuel injection nozzle has an outwardly opening valve 17, a small passage 7 delivering the fuel to the injection orifice 5 at low fuel flows and a larger main flow passage consisting of a number of passages 9 which deliver the bulk of the fuel to the injection orifice at large fuel flows. the valve 17 being connected to a spring-loaded piston 20 which opens the passages 9 as the fuel supply pressure increases. The valve 17 slides in a bore 19 in a sleeve 13 and is adjustably attached to the piston 20 by a rod 23 which is flexible enough to allow for slight lateral misalignment of the axes of the valve and piston. Part of the -fuel supplied through a filter 4 from a fuel supply manifold connected at 2 flows directly through the passage 7 in a sleeve 6 to an annular chamber 14 in the sleeve 13 from which it flows through narrow helical passages 15 to the space 16 adjacent the spraying orifice 5. The remaining fuel is supplied through passages 9 under the control of the piston 20 which has a bevelled end 30 controlling the inlet of the fuel to an annular chamber 12 connected to the passages 9. the other ends of which are connected by tangential swirl passages 10 to the space 16. The small passages 15 cause a rapid initial build-up of pressure in the nozzle which causes the piston 20 to move to the right to open the valve 17 wide, the bevelled part 30 permitting a large variation in fuel supply over a comparatively small range of rise in pressure. The space behind the piston 20 is vented to the combustion space by a passage 24 and bores 26. The conical surface of the valve 17, Fig. 6, comprises a part 38 parallel to the valve seat 37 and a part 39 of greater conical angle which prevents the angle of the conical spray decreasing when the valve is wide open. In a modification the inlet to the passage 7 is also controlled by the piston 20.",PARKER APPLIANCE CO,CAMPBELL JOHN FRANCIS,,https://lens.org/088-386-491-220-056,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,F23D11/26,F23D11/26,F4T TGL           TGL,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The ticket issuing machine has two switches set by the driver to generate a fare stage signal and a keyboard for entering class of ticket and fare due. The ticket issuing machine records magnetically the entry fare stage and fare due and prints the entry stage, destination stage, and fare due. During the journey a passenger inserts his ticket in a validating machine together with the necessary money. The fare due signal and money received are compared in a register and a destination fare stage signal magnetically recorded and the word PAID printed, if sufficient money is inserted. A change-giving mechanism is included to refund excess money inserted. The fare stage signal generated by the ticketissuing machine is fed to a first register in the exit machine. The destination fare stage signal on a ticket is fed to a second register and the contents of the two registers compared. If the contents in the first register are less than, or equal, the contents in the second register, the exit gate is released.

CAMPBELL. 17 Aug., 1967 [31 Aug., 1966], No. 37971/67. Heading H4R. In a line television distribution system, each receiver has associated with it a generator of a signal identifying that receiver and means for modulating the identification signal in order to indicate a subscriber's response to a programme. The distribution system described in Specification 1.090,778 is utilized in which a programme selector 17 (Fig. 2) for a television receiver 14 includes a network 29 under the control of the T.V. viewer for passing the selected television programme signals. Also included is a signal generator 30 under the control of the viewer coupled to an isolation network 31 for passing the identification signal back over the line to an analyser and recorder (28), Fig. 1 (not shown). The frequency of the identifying signal provided by the generator identifies the receiver and also the programme selected, or merely the receiver. A switch 32, either electronic or in the form of contacts, is normally closed but may be actuated by the viewer to interrupt the line passing the identification signal. The switch 32, upon being actuated opens for a brief time, e.g. for a second or less, and then automatically closes. A question asked by an announcer may be answered by code, e.g. Morse code, or a double interruption indicates "" yes "" and a single interruption indicates ""no"". Alternatively, a modulator 33 (Fig. 3) connects the signal generator 30 and isolation network 31. In operation the viewer speaks into a microphone 34 to modulate the identification signal by the modulator 33. A demodulating network in the analyser and recorder (28) permits the viewer to talk to the announcer.",CAMPBELL JOHN OWEN,CAMPBELL JOHN OWEN,,https://lens.org/145-521-954-098-54X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,H04N7/17309;;H04N7/17309;;H04N21/2543;;H04N21/2543;;H04N21/25891;;H04N21/25891;;H04N21/42203;;H04N21/42203;;H04N21/42684;;H04N21/42684;;H04N21/4758;;H04N21/4758,H04N7/173,H4R RCS           RCS;;H4R R17B1B        -;;H4R R17D          -;;H4R R17T          RCS;;H4R R17U          RCS,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Feeding webs.-In coin-freed apparatus for the sale of tickets, the ticket or like strip 84, Fig. 4, passes from a storage roller between delivery rollers 87, 88, from which it hangs in a loose loop 270, passing thence between rollers 112, 113 to guides 115, 116, between which it is fed to the delivery aperture by a sliding carriage 120, Fig. 7, bearing dogs 123 adapted to engage notches 118 in the strip. The. strip is fed to the loop 270 by the rotation of the rollers 87, 88, through gear 75, spindle 77, and gear 96, 98, 102, 106 from a rack 74 on a bar 65. The gear 96 is carried by a sleeve 93, Fig. 18, which is clutched to the spindle 77 by a cam 90 and balls 94 only during the upward movement of the bar 65. After prepayment, a handle 23 is rotated, thereby raising the bar 65 to feed forward the strip the space of one, two, or five tickets by means of one of the guided rods 250, 256, 52, Fig. 2, having lateral cam-portions 250<1>, 256<1>, 52<1>, engaged by pins 55 on disks 15, 17, 16 respectively, according as a sixpence, shilling, or half-crown has been inserted, lateral arms on the rods taking under adjustable screws on the bar 65. The carriage 120 is raised simultaneously, being carried by a rack bar 125, Fig. 4, gearing with a wheel 126 on the spindle 77, and, at the commencement of such movement, the pivoted dogs 123, Fig. 7, are turned out of engagement with thenotches 118 in the strip owing to the lost motion between the carriage 120 and a frame 140, teeth 143 on the frame engaging teeth 139 on the dogs, and a projection 148 on the carrier working between projections 149,150 on the frame. The upward movement of the rack 125 simultaneously raises the pivoted cutter-blade 153, Fig. 13, through a lever 166 and link 168, the blade being retained in this position by the engagement of an inturned lug 173 with a notch 171 of a spring-controlled lever 169.

Locks, key; padlocks; fastenings; key holders.- Relates to a modified form of the locking- device described in Specification No. 28,475, A.D. 1902, for drawers, doors, and other articles. The device is readily convertible into a spring push - fastening, and is applicable also to padlocks. Fig. 4 shows the fastening in the unlocked position as applied to a drawer. Three concentric tubes a, b, c, together with the baffles, form the cartridge mechanism. The retaining-catch o is made separate from the spring m; the spring normally retains the catch in the raised position, and withdraws it to the position shown when the entire mechanism is pressed by the finger, or when the inner tube is pressed inwards by means of the key. The slot t in the tail end of the catch may be replaced by a stud or screw provided with a head beneath which the spring acts. The inner tube c is provided with a flange 1 having a tooth 2, Fig. 3, which engages an incline 3 or a recess 5 both forming part of a block on the lock-plate f. The outer tube a carries two detachable slotted discs or baffles, which have dummy keyholes and are held in place by the flange j and the intermediate tube b. A transverse slot k in the pushtube c constitutes the master keyhole, and receives the key after it has traversed the slots in the baffles ; the key is then rotated clockwise, and the tooth 2 travels up the incline 3 and abuts against a shoulder 6 on the block 3 ; the tube c is thus moved inwards, and the spring m forced into the position shown in Fig. 3. To place the catch o in the operative position, the key is turned until the tooth 2 enters the recess 5 ; the cartridge cannot then be depressed. When the tooth is in any position between the incline of the recess, the lock is converted into a spring push-fastening. To prevent the latch from being released by the insertion of a bent wire or other tool, the spring m is provided with an ear 7, between which and the spring the disc 1 engages, thus preventing the spring from being moved backwards without the tube c, the tube being prevented from moving by the tooth 2 engaging the recess 5. The latch described in the prior Specification for holding the cartridge in place may be dispensed with, or it may be retained, as shown at l in Figs. 6 and 7, being mounted upon the cartridge instead of upon the lock-plate. The plate a<1> carrying the master keyhole a<2> is formed in one with, or is fixed to, the tube b. The latch has a projection 8 adapted to engage a lug on the lock-plate &c. The cartridge is prevented from rotating by a pin engaging a slot in the socket e'. The arrangement is applied to padlocks, as shown in Figs. 9 and 10. The cartridge is introduced from the front, the retaining-catch o is carried on the spring m, and the inner tube is replaced by a pin c pivoted to the inner end of the spring and free to turn about its axis. The inner end of the pin is fitted with a peripheral tooth 2 adapted to ride up the incline 4, Fig. 12, or to pass beneath the end 5 of the block 3, according as the look is to be fastened or released. To fix the cartridge a, it has a rib 13, Fig. 13, with a gap 14 into which engages a sliding latch carried on the rear side of the front plate. The bow of the lock is arranged to secure the sliding latch in position. The key is shaped as shown in Fig. 14, or other forms may be used. A device for holding the keys for the various cartridges is shown in Figs. 15 and 16, and is adapted for attachment to a watch chain. The sheath 18 is fitted with a sliding frame 19 having a pin 20 upon which the keys g are pivoted. A stud 21 engaging a groove in the frame prevents the frame from leaving the sheath. The key to be used is turned outwards, as shown in Fig. 15, the frame then being returned to the sheath.",CAMPBELL JOHN SMALLEY,CAMPBELL JOHN SMALLEY,,https://lens.org/111-064-487-538-475,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Class 83 (3). [Also in Group XXXVIII] In a feeler-controlled copying- machine the work-table is movable in a plane in two directions normal to each other, and the feeler and cutting-tool are movable together, in a direction normal to the plane, under the influence of opposed thrust forces, the resultant of which is a function of the distance between the feeler and a pattern on the work-table. The opposed thrust forces are derived from magnetic clutches in an electronic control circuit similar to that shown in Specification 699,452. In a copy milling machine the work and the pattern are fixed to a table 50 movable longitudinally on a cross-slide 52, movable on a vertically-adjustable knee 24. Both tool and feeler are reciprocated together towards and away from the work and pattern, respectively, by a continuously-running motor 66 acting through two opposing slipping clutches normally energized equally. "" In "" or "" out "" feed is then controlled by varying the energization of the clutches differentially under the control of an electric-circuit including an electric spark between the feeler and pattern. Variations from the normal distance between the feeler and pattern vary the spark-current from normal, these current variations being amplified and controlling the clutches as described in Specification 699,452. Scanning may be effected manually through handles 374, 376 or automatically. The cutter 58 is secured by a collet 126 in a spindle 74 rotatably mounted in a quill 72 slidable in a housing 84. The upper end of spindle 74 is splined at 134 to an intermediate shaft 138. The motor 80, Fig. 1, drives the cutter through a pulley 170, belt 174, pulley 140 and the intermediate shaft 138. The quill is reciprocated towards or away from the work by the differential energization of two slipping clutches 68, 70, the driving elements 190, 194 of which are continuously driven by the motor 66 in opposite directions. The driven elements of the clutches are connected through similar gear trains to respective pinions 228 (not shown) engaging a rack on the quill. When energization of the clutches is varied differentially by a control signal the appropriate one of the two clutches drives the quill to adjust the tool and the feeler. Keyed to the quill 72 at 276 is an arm 78 guided by a rod 266. At its outer end the arm is bifurcated to support the feeler assembly. The feeler 60 is made of brass, steel or low-fusing non-shrinking lead or bismuth alloys and the pattern may be moist plaster of Paris, a casting or modelling of wax covered with an electrically-conductive paint or of metal. The feeler 60 is secured in, but insulated from, a tube 290 freely reciprocable in bearings 304, 306 in the casing 88. At its upper end the tube 290 carries a micrometer 320 for axially adjusting a sleeve 300 flanged at 302 to engage the ends of arm 78. The feeler assembly merely rests on the arm 78 so that if the feeler contacts the pattern it may rise and damage is prevented. Current is led to the feeler by leads 588, 606 and respective series resistors 586, 604 to a common contact point engaging the top of the feeler. The table 50 is reciprocated by a traverse motor which is reversed at each end of the table travel by stops 430, 432 opening or closing a micro-switch 436 on the cross-slide. At each actuation of the motor reversing switch a further switch is actuated to cause increased conduction in one or the other of two triodes for a duration dependent on the time constants of associated resistor - condenser combinations. During these short time intervals a sensitive relay is actuated, which, if the machine is set for automatic feed, disconnects the table traverse motor and switches in the cross-slide feed motor, the direction of which is controlled by a manually set switch. The work and the pattern are thus scanned in a series of parallel lines, the distance between alternate pairs of these lines being determined by the settings of the variable resistors. The cross-slide feed may alternatively be effected at will by moving a switch so that the feed motor is connected up continuously. Should the feeler approach the pattern too closely, the resultant current through the two clutches increases sufficiently to operate a series-connected relay which disconnects the scanning feed motors. Should the power supply fail a no-volt release relay drops off and emits an earth (i.e. positive) pulse to energize the outfeed clutch for the short time taken for the moving elements to come to rest. Limiting depth of cut.-The tube 290 of the feeler assembly carries a contact 342 which, when the cutter has reached a predetermined depth in the work, approaches near enough to a rod 326 secured to the casing 88, to cause a spark to pass. This current functions similarly to an increase in the current of the spark between the feeler and pattern to energize the "" out "" feed clutch and prevent further inward feed movement of the feeler and tool.

The wheel comprises a central hub (1) and an outer rim (3) interconnected by a web (5), with a pair of annular braking discs (7) being mounted one on each side of the web (5) by means of at least two connection assemblies (9). To avoid the problem of thermal stress cracking which occurs after a period of use when braking discs (7) are bolted directly to the web (5), the connection assemblies (9) each comprise a plate member (11) which is slidably retained in a generally radially extending slot (15) in the rear face of a braking disc (7). The plate members (11) are preferably flexible and of a thickness which is less than the depth of the slot (15). Attachment means (25,27) secure the plate member (11) to the web (5) so that the braking discs (7) are solely subjected to the pull of the flexed plate members (11) irrespective of how tightly the attachment means (25,27) secure the plate member (11) to the web (5).

Coffee &c. making apparatus. -The apparatus shown in Fig. 1 is used in conjunction with a pot a, and consists of a tubular holder b, divided into two compartments by a perforated conical partition d which is kept in position by frictional contact of the lower ring portion d' with the holder b. A perforated bottom is kept in position by an annular rib d' and lugs d<3>, and it can be removed by rotating it so that notches in its periphery enable it to pass the lugs. The holder b fits loosely in a flanged ring c, fixed on the top of the pot, and by means of pins b<1>, which can be caused to rest on the flange or to pass through a groove c<2> therein, the holder can be retained at various heights. The lid f may be doubly-flanged so that it fits both pot and infuser. In use, fine coffee is placed above the partition d, and coarser coffee, which may be of a different blend, is placed beneath the partition d and retained on the bottom. Sufficient hot water is then poured into the holder. By this means, the fine coffee is prevented from stopping percolation and the coarse coffee from rising to the top. In a modification, for a jug, the ring c is provided with a hinged flap, which covers the lip during percolation but when the infuser is removed may act as a protector for the thumb.

One or more additional acids may be present, e.g. sulphuric, hydrochloric, nitric, hydrofluoric, hydrobromic, orthophosphoric, or sulphonic acids or one or more boric acid derivatives of polyhydric alcohols. A second acid radical chosen from sulphate, nitrate, fluoride, chloride, bromide, cyanide, cyanate, thio-cyanate or phosphate may also be present and may be as the acid present as the additional acid. An H2O2 stabilizer as defined in Specification 1,056,121 may be present, e.g. a salt of a condensed phosphoric acid having a polymerization number up to about 14. There may also be present an oxygen-containing organic compound, e.g. an alcohol, aldehyde, ketone, ether, ester, amide, oxygen-containing amine or carboxyl acid having a solubility of at least 1% in an amount such as to form a single liquid phase. The solid catalysts are at least one element from Groups 1 or 8 as described in Specification 1,041,045 or as described in Specification 1,056,125, i.e. a palladium salt of an isopoly or heteropoly acid. An unreactive diluent gas may be present and the source of oxygen may then be air. The reaction may be carried out at atmospheric pressure, but pressures up to 50 atmospheres each of hydrogen and oxygen, for example, may be used. 20 DEG C. is a convenient temperature, but lower temperatures, e.g. 0 DEG to - 20 DEG C. may be used. Either batch or continuous process may be used. The H2O2 may be used to prepare perborates, e.g. of sodium by adding sufficient of a borate, e.g. borax and/or boric acid and an alkaline substance to react with the H2O2 present.",ICI LTD,CAMPBELL JOHN STEWART,,https://lens.org/157-401-823-819-051,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,14,0,C01B15/12;;C01B15/029,C01B15/029;;C01B15/12,C1A AD33          AG1D;;C1A AG1           AG1D;;C1A AG1D33        -;;C1A AG50          AG1D;;C1A AG50D33       -;;C1A APB5          AG1D;;C1A A7AX          A7;;C1A A7AY          A7;;C1A A7A2          A7,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

McIntosh, J. C. Dec. 24. Gas and like engines.-In fourstroke-cycle engines having two reciprocating sleeve valves arranged concentrically with the working cylinder, a liner is interposed between the piston and the inner sleeve, and the sleeves are operated from an overhead cam-shaft by rods connected to the sleeves at opposite ends of a diameter, the construction being arranged to facilitate access to the working parts and to permit efficient lubrication. As shown in Figs. 2 and 4, the valves G, H are arranged in an annular chamber formed by an outer water-cooled casing R, a cylinder liner M, and a detachable water-cooled cylinder head D. The valves are connected to cranks or eccentrics on the shafts C by rods I, J attached to lugs G<1>, H<1> on the valves, these rods passing through apertures K in the cylinder heads. In a multi-cylinder engine, the apertures K form chambers common to adjacent cylinder heads, and the shaft C may be made up of sections which can be removed separately from each cylinder head. Bearings for the shaft C are formed in the supports C', C<2>, and a casing for the shaft and valve-gear is formed by bridge-pieces T carried by the supports C', C', and by a cover K<1>. The chamber K may be used as a grease-cup or oil-well, and passages Ware drilled through the cylinder casting for drainage; or these passages may be used for the supply of oil under pressure. The cylinder head, the valves, and the operating- mechanism may be removed together for inspection. In a modification of this construction, the liner M extends upwards through the height of the cylinder head and carries packing-rings above and below the ports ; or the liner is formed by a water-cooled extension of the detachable cylinder head. As shown in Fig. 14, the valves are outside the watercooled cylinder and head which are formed integral, and the outer casing is not water-cooled. In this arrangement packing - rings are provided in the outer valve sleeve.",MCINTOSH JOHN CAMPBELL,MCINTOSH JOHN CAMPBELL,,https://lens.org/130-213-055-553-765,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The flowable material ink thereby flows continuously from the supply tank 41 to the recovery tank 42 via a head unit 33. The ink is returned to the supply tank 41 from the recovery tank 42 by a pump mechanism 44. A first pump 441 and a second pump 442 of the pump mechanism 44 is provided with: inflow side check valves 62, 72; and outflow side check valves 63, 73. In each pump, the ink flows into a pump chamber from the recovery tank 42 through the inflow side check valve by lowering the air pressure in the pump chamber, and the ink is led to the supply tank 41 through the outflow side check valve by building up air pressure in the pump chamber. In the printer, the structure of the pump is simplified by changing air pressure in the pump chamber to deliver the ink. <P>COPYRIGHT: (C)2011,JPO&INPIT",DAINIPPON SCREEN MFG,NICHOLAS JOHN CAMPBELL,,https://lens.org/021-309-500-264-377,Patent Application,no,3,15,2,2,0,,B41J2/175,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

Planet gears, engaging both the sun gear and ring gear, are mounted on a carrier which is revolvable as the planet gears orbit around the sun gear while transmitting drive from the motor to the wheel with a speed reduction and a corresponding torque amplification. The carrier is not tightly restrained in either the radial or axial direction enabling positional self-adjustment to relieve stress concentrations at gear teeth. Limits for the axial and radial play of the floating carrier are fixed by positioner means defining an annular groove into which the radially innermost edge of the carrier is loosely received, thrust bearing means such as thrust pins or annular thrust rings being situated within the groove at each side of the carrier edge. Situating the positioner means at the minimum diameter portion of the carrier minimizes friction, wear, power dissipation and heating as that portion of the carrier turns at a smaller velocity than the more outward portions of the carrier.",CATERPILLAR TRACTOR CO,CAMPBELL JOHN J,,https://lens.org/159-636-327-085-908,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,3,0,B60K17/046;;B60K17/14;;F16H1/28;;F16H2001/2881;;F16H1/28;;F16H2001/2881;;B60K17/14;;B60K17/046,B60K17/04;;B60K17/14;;F16H1/28,74-118,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Each planet gear is fastened to the carrier through a bearing and axle pin having ends which extend through support bores in the carrier. Lubricant is maintained around the carrier and each axle pin has a lubricant passage with an outlet directed toward the bearing and with an inlet facing in the direction of orbital motion of the axle pin to cause such motion to force lubricant into the passage. Longitudinal movement of all axle pins and also angular motion of all axle pins relative to the supporting carrier is prevented by a single unitary retainer element secured to a surface of the carrier and having edge portions which extend into a linear slot in the sidewall of each axle pin.,CATERPILLAR TRACTOR CO,CAMPBELL JOHN J,,https://lens.org/197-734-829-837-45X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,3,0,B60K17/046;;F16H1/46;;F16H57/082;;F16H1/46;;B60K17/046;;F16H57/082,B60K17/04;;F16H1/46,74-118,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Alternatively the urea may be present during the formation of the H2O2. The adducts may be used in the oxidation of olefines. The non-acidic solutions of H2O2 produced as above may be reacted to produce substituted hydroxylamines from primary or secondary amines, oximes from primary amines and amine oxides from tertiary amines. Sequestering agents may be present during the latter reaction. Examples describe the production of cyclohexylamine hydrogon peroxide adduct and its conversion to N-cyclohexyl hydroxylamine, and the oxidation of cyclohexylamine to give a cyclohexylamine-cyclohexanone oxime adduct from which cyclohexanone oxime is isolated, the cyclohexylamine being recovered as its sulphate.ALSO:Non-acidic H2O2 solutions are prepared by addition of a precipitant for the acid used in the preparation of H2O2 by the reaction of H2 and O2 in an aqueous acidic reaction medium in the presence of a solid catalyst as described in Specification 1,041,045. The precipitant is a substance which forms with the acid present a compound of low solubility in the solution and is itself of low solubility therein, e.g. the carbonate or hydroxide of Ca, Sr, Ba, Pb, Na or K or an ion-exchange resin. Preferably a non-acidic oxygen-containing organic compound is present, e.g. acetone, preferably forming at least 20% by volume of the solvent at precipitation. An H2O2 stabilizer as defined in Specification 1,056,121 may be present. The non-acidic solution may be reacted with an amide to form an amide hydrogen peroxide adduct. The amide is preferably soluble in the solvent medium, e.g. urea when aqueous acetone is the solvent. H2O2 of low water content may be produced by the reaction of such an adduct with a non-aqueous liquid which dissolves H2O2 preferentially to the amide, e.g. by adding anhydrous acetone to the anhydrous urea hydrogen peroxide adduct and filtering.",ICI LTD,CAMPBELL JOHN STEWART,,https://lens.org/050-762-225-067-885,Granted Patent,no,0,3,1,1,0,C01B15/029;;C01B15/013,C01B15/013;;C01B15/029,C1A A7AX          A7;;C1A A7AY          A7;;C1A A7A2          A7;;C2C CKC;;C2C CMV;;C2C CNK;;C2C C20Y;;C2C C22Y;;C2C C22Y;;C2C C221;;C2C C221;;C2C C225;;C2C C225;;C2C C227;;C2C C227;;C2C C29X;;C2C C29X;;C2C C29Y;;C2C C29Y;;C2C C30Y;;C2C C30Y;;C2C C30Y;;C2C C32Y;;C2C C321;;C2C C34Y;;C2C C341;;C2C C345;;C2C C346;;C2C C578;;C2C C620;;C2C C626;;C2C C660;;C2C C709;;C2C C711;;C2C C719,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In certain wheels where high duty braking discs (9) are required, the discs (9) are mounted one on each side of the web (5) of the wheel by bolts which pass through spaced apart holes in the discs. These holes, besides reducing the available braking area also act as centres for surface cracking, this surface cracking occurring around the bolt holes as a result of the large internal stresses set up by differential thermal expansion. The present invention provides an annular braking disc (9) comprising at least two curved segments (11) mounted on each side of the web (5) of the wheel, each segment (11) being secured to the web (5) by at least one gripping member (13) which is secured to the web (5) and grips the outer circum- ferential edge of the disc segment (11) via an intermediate member (23), and by at least one resilient retaining connection (15) at each end (17) of the segment. Each resilient retaining connection (15) is second to the web (5) and engages a surface provided on an end region (17) of a disc segment (11). Thus, whilst the outer edge of a segment (11) can slide circum- ferentially relative to the gripping members (13) under ther- mel expansion, the end regions (17) can also slide over said resilient retaining connections (15) whereby minimal internal stresses are produced in the segments (11).",LUCAS IND PLC,WATSON JOHN CAMPBELL,CESSIONE;SAB WABCO HOLDINGS B.V.

Apparatus for electrolytic treatment of rotating articles. W.J. CAMPBELL. March 31, 1967 [April 5, 1966], No.15036/66. Heading C7B. In a method of electrolytically producing a protective coating upon an article e.g. by anodizing or electro-plating, the periphery of the article is continuously rotated such that a portion only thereof is immersed in the electrolyte at any one time and the electrolyte is caused to flow in contact with the immersed portion at right angles to the direction of rotation thereof. In the form shown a cylindrical article 1 is rotated about shafts 2 positioned at each end thereof such that part of the periphery of the cylinder is immersed in electrolyte 5 contained in the tank 4. Beneath and about the cylinder 1 is positioned an arcuate sheet 9 e.g. of copper, stainless steel or other metal or of a plastics material having metal strips attached thereto, which sheet serves as a baffle and forms the counter-electrode. Electrolyte 5 is supplied via inlet 15 to the arcuate passage between the cylinder 1 and sheet 9 to flow through the passage and thereafter to flow between the underside of the baffle 9 and the floor of the tank 4 to pass over baffle 16 to outlet 17 - see arrows 5. Copper baffles used may be rigid or flexible and if the latter, the curvature of the copper sheet may be adjusted according to the diameter of the cylindrical article to be coated. One end of the base of the baffle may be raised with respect to the other end to accommodate conical shaped workpieces. Further electrolyte may be supplied to the cell, e.g. by means of a sparge tube 18 positioned above the workpiece, having a plurality of jets increasing in size from the inlet end of the tank to supply a greater cooling effect furthest therefrom. The process may be used for anodizing large cylindrical aluminium articles such as torpedoes.",CAMPBELL WILLIAM JOHN,CAMPBELL WILLIAM JOHN,,https://lens.org/029-909-971-411-396,Granted Patent,no,0,1,2,2,0,C25D5/08;;C25D11/04;;C25D21/10;;C25D21/10;;C25D11/04;;C25D5/08,C25D5/08;;C25D11/04;;C25D21/10,C7B BAV           AV;;C7B BA2B1         -;;C7B BA2C5         -;;C7B BA2H          -;;C7B BA5           -;;C7B B120          AV;;C7B B124          AV;;C7B B282          AV;;C7C CA199;;C7C CA253;;C7C CA26X;;C7C CA264;;C7C CA308;;C7C CA327;;C7C CA541;;C7C CA566;;C7C CA587;;C7C CA588;;C7C CA64Y;;C7C CA641;;C7C CA653;;C7C CB179;;C7C CB188;;C7C CB189;;C7C CB197;;C7C CB199;;C7C CB223;;C7C CB232;;C7C CB238;;C7C CB24X;;C7C CB245;;C7C CB246;;C7C CB25Y;;C7C CB348;;C7C CB349;;C7C CB354;;C7C CB409;;C7C CB414;;C7C CB415;;C7C CB416;;C7C CB454;;C7C CB460;;C7C CB464;;C7C CB477;;C7C CB478;;C7C CB479;;C7C CB480;;C7C CB481;;C7C CB489;;C7C CB50Y;;C7C CB501;;C7C CB523;;C7C CB524;;C7C CB528;;C7C CB529;;C7C CB53Y;;C7C CB530;;C7C CB533;;C7C CB554;;C7C CB556;;C7C CB557;;C7C CB558;;C7C CB561;;C7C CB57X;;C7C CB576;;C7C CB577;;C7C CB581;;C7C CB582;;C7C CB584;;C7C CB588;;C7C CB59Y;;C7C CB599;;C7C CB604;;C7C CB606;;C7C CB61Y;;C7C CB610;;C7C CB629;;C7C CB63Y;;C7C CB632;;C7C CC678;;C7C CC681;;C7C CC695;;C7C CC698;;C7C CC699;;C7C CC711;;C7C CC712;;C7C CC718;;C7C CC72Y;;C7C CC724;;C7C CC728,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The power transmitted by a rotating shaft 1, Fig. 1, is determined by producing a series of pulses whose repetition frequency is indicative of the speed of rotation of the shaft and modifying the amplitude of the pulses in accordance with the torque in the shaft. This signal is then fed to a meter to give a direct indication of shaft power. The pulses are produced in a unit 3 which comprises a photo-transistor 7, Fig. 5, which conducts when light from a tungsten filament lamp 9 is reflected from one or more paint spots 12 on the shaft, on to it. The lamp and transistor are arranged in two compartments (6), (8), Figs. 2, 3 (not shown), of a moulded housing (5) on the shaft casing, the compartments being provided with apertures (10), (11) through which the light is transmitted and received. The pulses are shaped and polarized in the circuit of Fig. 5 and are supplied via an amplifier as the energizing voltage of a Wheatstone bridge of which two or four arms comprise torque detecting strain gauges 2 arranged on the shaft substantially as described in Specification 862, 462. The output from the bridge is thus a series of amplitude modified pulses as above.

Planet gears, engaging both the sun gear and ring gear, are mounted on a carrier which is revolvable as the planet gears orbit around the sun gear while transmitting drive from the motor to the wheel with a speed reduction and a corresponding torque amplification. The carrier is not tightly restrained in either the radial or axial direction enabling positional self-adjustment to relieve stress concentrations at gear teeth. Limits for the axial and radial play of the floating carrier are fixed by positioner means defining an annular groove into which the radially innermost edge of the carrier is loosely received, thrust bearing means such as thrust pins or annular thrust rings being situated within the groove at each side of the carrier edge. Situating the positioner means at the minimum diameter portion of the carrier minimizes friction, wear, power dissipation and heating as that portion of the carrier turns at a smaller velocity than the more outward portions of the carrier.",CATERPILLAR TRACTOR CO,CAMPBELL JOHN J,CATERPILLAR INC.

Locks, key; fastenings.-A lock, suitable for boxes, drawers, cabinets, portmanteaus, bags, cigar and cigarette cases, purses, &c., is so arranged that it may be converted into an ordinary spring-push fastening. Figs. 4 and 5 show a lock suitable for a desk, despatch box, jewel case, cabinet, &c. A tube a is provided with a flange to engage a shoulder in a socket e or an adjustable tube s secured within the socket e, and has also an internal flange, which acts as a seat for a slotted disc, plate, or dummy keyhole d. Within the tube a is a tube b closed at the top by a plug k, which is slotted or perforated to form a keyhole. Within the tube b is located a push tube or rod c. The inner ends of the tubes a, b, c lie flush with the base-plate f, and the tubes a, b are retained in the socket by means of a pivoted latch l or other suitable means. A spring catch m, pivoted to the plate f, is formed with a latch piece o to engage the hasp or striking plate o<1>. This catch is guided by a pin p, but can be turned out of the way when it is desired to withdraw the tubes. To release the catch, a key g, Fig. 12, is inserted in the dummy keyhole d, which is turned until it is brought into line with the keyhole in the tube b. The key is passed through these holes, and is employed to push down the tube c, which presses the catch out of engagement with the plate o<1>. By turning the latch l out of engagement with the tubes a, b, the device is converted into a fastening, and can be operated by pressing down the tube a. The tubes may be withdrawn readily to enable the tube provided with the keyhole plug k to be changed. This plug may be formed in a cap provided with steps to engage corresponding steps in the tube b, so that the cap may be changed without changing the tube. Instead of the flange on the tube a and the engaging shoulder in the socket e or tube s, the tubes a, b may be formed at the bottom with flanges to engage a guide-pin, and the latch l adapted to enter a slot in the tubes to retain them within the socket. In another arrangement, the tube c is dispensed with, and the key acts directly upon the catch. The tube a carries the dummy keyhole at the top, and carries at the lower end a plate perforated to form the actual keyhole.",CAMPBELL JOHN SMALLEY,CAMPBELL JOHN SMALLEY,,https://lens.org/076-123-916-901-552,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Campbell, J. S. May 19. Brakes for bicycles &c. actuated by rotating one of the handles. The handle 1 is rotatably mounted on the handle-bar 2, its motion being limited by a pin on the handle-bar engaging a socket in the handle. A rod 3 secured to the handle actuates, through a flexible shaft contained in the handlebar, a rod 4 turning in bearings 5 and connected by an arm 6 to the brake rod 7, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The flexible shaft comprises tubes 8 shown enlarged in Fig. 6, having at each end forked arms 9<a> and 11<a>, pivotally secured by studs 13 and 14 to blocks 12 so as to form universal joints. A felt or similar ring 15<x> carried between flanges 15 and 15<a> on a sleeve 15<b>, rotatably secured to each tube 8 by compressing the sleeve 15<b> into a depression formed in the tube 8, renders the shaft noiseless. In a modification, the flexible shaft consists of a wire coil carried either in an india-rubber tube which fits in the handle-bar, or by india-rubber washers secured on the shaft. To secure the brake in its active or inactive position, a spring pawl 16 is mounted in a slot 1<x> formed in the handle 1 so as to engage a ratchet-wheel 18 concealed under the handle. A tooth 16<b>, Fig. 5, on the pawl 16 engag the ordinary ratchet teeth and secures the brake in its action. The brake is secured in its inactive position by the pawl engaging a depression 17 in the wheel 18. Pressure on the rear end of the pawl 16 releases the brake. The pawl 16 may be provided with a screw 19, as shown in Fig. 8, in order to lock it on the wheel 18.
