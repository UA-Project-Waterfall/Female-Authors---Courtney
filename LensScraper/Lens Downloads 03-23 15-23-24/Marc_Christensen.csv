In one embodiment, the housing has opposing end walls, opposing sidewalls, and a substantially flat bottom wall. A spline and groove are each positioned on one of the opposing end walls. The spline and groove are configured to interlock adjacently positioned barriers. In yet another embodiment, a spout and receiving aperture are positioned on opposing end walls. In this embodiment, the spout of one barrier can be received in sealed fluid communication with the receiving port of an adjacent barrier, thereby allowing fluid communication of the ballast between adjacent barriers. Finally, in yet another embodiment, the bottom wall of the housing can be arched so as to form a passageway extending through the barrier.
