The thread wiper assembly is particularly advantageous with sewing machines that are equipped with a walking foot. The thread wiper is mounted sidewardly relative to the needle and includes a picker arm, that while in a retracted position, is disposed sidewardly relative to the needle and out of its path of travel. Because the thread wiper is mounted to the side of the sewing machine and sidewardly relative to the needle, the picker arm is able to traverse along a path between the needle and the walking foot without interference. An actuating member: (i) lowers the picker arm in a direction substantially parallel to the needle until a free end of the picker arm is at a level between the needle and the walking foot; (ii) sidewardly thrusts the picker arm at a first angle, relative to a vertical axis, towards the needle along a path between the needle and the walking foot without interference; (iii) advances further sideways the picker arm at a second angle, relative to the vertical axis, greater than the first angle; and (iv) retracts away while raising the picker member in a reverse movement to complete the cycle. The thread wiper may include a microprocessor that is programmed to intelligently disable/enable the thread wiper depending on such factors as the adjustment in rise of the walking foot and/or whether the turn back operation of the sewing machine is activated. The thread wiper assembly is also suitable for use with a sewing machine that does not have a walking foot.",CLINTON IND;;CAMPBELL KIRK BRIAN;;SCHUELER PETER,CAMPBELL KIRK BRIAN;;SCHUELER PETER,,https://lens.org/052-218-725-620-097,Search Report,yes,10,0,5,5,0,D05B65/06;;D05B65/06,D05B65/06,,1,0,,,"PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN vol. 2000, no. 23 10 February 2001 (2001-02-10)",PENDING

    A thread wiper assembly mountable to the side of a sewing machine. The thread wiper assembly is particularly advantageous with sewing machines that are equipped with a walking foot. The thread wiper is mounted sidewardly relative to the needle and includes a picker arm, that while in a retracted position, is disposed sidewardly relative to the needle and out of its path of travel. Because the thread wiper is mounted to the side of the sewing machine and sidewardly relative to the needle, the picker arm is able to traverse along a path between the needle and the walking foot without interference. An actuating member: (i) lowers the picker arm in a direction substantially parallel to the needle until a free end of the picker arm is at a level between the needle and the walking foot; (ii) sidewardly thrusts the picker arm at a first angle, relative to a vertical axis, towards the needle along a path between the needle and the walking foot without interference; (iii) advances further sideways the picker arm at a second angle, relative to the vertical axis, greater than the first angle; and (iv) retracts away while raising the picker member in a reverse movement to complete the cycle. The thread wiper may include a microprocessor that is programmed to intelligently disable/enable the thread wiper depending on such factors as the adjustment in rise of the walking foot and/or whether the turn back operation of the sewing machine is activated. The thread wiper assembly is also suitable for use with a sewing machine that does not have a walking foot.

SOLUTION: A support device 10 for exterior bricks is made of a number of superposed steel sheets 12 covered with a metal. Ribs 13 are formed in the sheet 12 and a plate-form parts 14 are formed between the ribs 13. And further, contracting zones 21 are formed at every distance in the longitudinal direction of the ribs 13.

An IDT produces a SAW when excited by a single electrical pulse and can be fabricated to embody a code, which code provides for a passive autocorrelation of a SAW input to the IDT and thereby lends itself t o further application as a signal generator in a communication device. However, conventional SAW expanders and compressors typically have insertion losses greater than 20 dB , which can have a profound effect on an RF link budget in a communication system. Insertion losses are drastically reduced by using a single phase unidirectional transducer (SPUDT-type) instead of a conventional IDT as a SAW expander/compressor. A SPUDT-type reflects SAW components which are lost in conventional IDT designs so that a stronger SAW is directed toward a transmission element. In a receiver, a SPUDT-type directs a stronger S,AW toward a compressor IDT. A communication system based on SPUDT-typ e techniques would be low-cost, low-power, small and simple alternative to kno wn short range communications schemes, including for example the Bluetooth TM solutio n.

An IDT produces a SAW when excited by a single electrical pulse and can be fabricated to embody a code, which code provides for a passive autocorrelation of a SAW input to the IDT and thereby lends itself to further application as a signal generator in a communication device. However, internal dimensions of IDTs are inversely proportional to operating frequency, such that high frequency IDTs present significant manufacturing difficulties. Fabrication of IDTs for high frequency applications is simplified by exploiting a harmonic frequency SAW generated by IDTs. An IDT may therefore be designed according to fundamental frequency internal dimension criteria but can operate at a multiple of the fundamental frequency, thereby providing much higher frequency operation than conventional SAW systems. A communication system based on SAW harmonic techniques would be low-cost, low-power, small and simple alternative to known short range communications schemes, including for example the Bluetooth™ solution.

The memory controller comprises a point of data consistency on the write channel prior to the memory; and the memory controller comprises comparison circuitry configured to compare the bather context value of each write request to be issued to the memory with the barrier context values of at least some pending read requests, the pending read requests being requests received at the memory controller but not yet issued to the memory and: in response to detecting at least one of the pending read requests with an earlier barrier context value identifying a bather transaction that has a corresponding barrier transaction in the stream of requests on the write channel that is earlier in the stream of requests than the write request, stalling the write request until the at least one pending read request has been performed; and in response to detecting no pending read requests with the earlier barrier context value, issuing the write request to the memory.",ADVANCED RISC MACH LTD;;CAMPBELL MICHAEL ANDREW;;RIOCREUX PETER ANDREW,CAMPBELL MICHAEL ANDREW;;RIOCREUX PETER ANDREW,ARM LIMITED (2011-08-12),https://lens.org/064-523-034-960-240,Patent Application,yes,5,18,2,2,0,G06F9/522;;G06F9/522,G06F12/14;;G06F12/08,711/146;;711/163;;X711E12098;;X711E12033,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

An IDT produces a SAW when excited by a single electrical pulse and can be fabricated to embody a code, which code provides for a passive autocorrelation of a SAW input to the IDT and thereby lends itself to further application as a signal generator in a communication device. However, conventional SAW expanders and compressors typically have insertion losses greater than 20 dB, which can have a profound effect on an RF link budget in a communication system. Insertion losses are drastically reduced by using a single phase unidirectional transducer (SPUDT-type) instead of a conventional IDT as a SAW expander/compressor. A SPUDT-type reflects SAW components which are lost in conventional IDT designs so that a stronger SAW is directed toward a transmission element. In a receiver, a SPUDT-type directs a stronger SAW toward a compressor IDT. A communication system based on SPUDT-type techniques would be low-cost, low-power, small and simple alternative to known short range communications schemes, including for example the Bluetooth TM solution. Operation of a SAW system at a frequency of 2.4 GHz is contemplated.

   SAW devices such as interdigital transducers (IDTs) have been widely used in RADAR applications and as filters. An IDT produces a SAW when excited by a single electrical pulse and can be fabricated to embody a code, which code provides for a passive autocorrelation of a SAW input to the IDT and thereby lends itself to further application as a signal generator in a communication device. However, conventional SAW expanders and compressors typically have insertion losses greater than 20 dB, which can have a profound effect on an RF link budget in a communication system. Insertion losses are drastically reduced by using a single phase unidirectional transducer (SPUDT-type) instead of a conventional IDT as a SAW expander/compressor. A SPUDT-type reflects SAW components which are lost in conventional IDT designs so that a stronger SAW is directed toward a transmission element. In a receiver, a SPUDT-type directs a stronger SAW toward a compressor IDT. A communication system based on SPUDT-type techniques would be low-cost, low-power, small and simple alternative to known short range communications schemes, including for example the Bluetooth solution. Operation of a SAW system at a frequency of 2.4 GHz is contemplated.

A passive surface acoustic wave (SAW) device includes multiple terminated interdigital transducers (IDTs) which generate reflected SAWs when excited by incident SAWs, each reflected SAW having magnitude and phase characteristics dependent upon the particular IDT termination. According to the invention, the IDT terminations include the impedance matching circuit and the impedance to be matched. Input IDTs in the SAW device are excited with electrical signals, which are converted to generate the incident SAWs. The resultant reflected SAWs are converted by output IDTs into output electrical signal signals which can then be analyzed to determine magnitude and phase differences between the output electrical signal signals and generate an impedance matching circuit control signal based thereon. <IMAGE>",RESEARCH IN MOTION LTD,CAMPBELL COLIN K;;EDMONSON PETER J,,https://lens.org/117-090-859-443-205,Granted Patent,no,0,0,10,10,0,H03H7/40;;H03H9/0042;;H03H9/0274;;H03H9/14505;;H03H9/1455;;H03H9/642;;H03H11/30;;H03H9/0274;;H03H9/14505;;H03H7/40;;H03H9/0042;;H03H9/1455;;H03H9/642;;H03H11/30,H03H7/38;;H03H9/00;;H03H9/02;;H03H9/145;;H03H9/25;;H03H9/64,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The apparatus includes pressure differential means for applying a pressure differential over the bed sufficiently to overcome the breakthrough pressure of the bed; and disturbing means for disturbing the structural coherency of at least part of the bed. The applicant found that the irreducible saturation point is lowered from a first level to a second level, wherein the first level is the baseline irreducible saturation point of the bed. The breakthrough pressure and lowered irreducible saturation point is also achieved in a relatively shorter time, obtaining a bed with a relatively lower moisture content than in the case where the structural coherency of the bed is not disturbed.",UNIV POTCHEFSTROOM;;LE ROUX MARCO;;CAMPBELL QUENTIN PETER,LE ROUX MARCO;;CAMPBELL QUENTIN PETER,,https://lens.org/081-202-111-405-347,Patent Application,yes,4,2,2,2,0,B01D33/04;;B01D33/58;;B01D2201/208,B01D33/04,,0,0,,,,PENDING

    SAW devices such as interdigital transducers (IDTs) have been widely used in RADAR applications and as filters. An IDT produces a SAW when excited by a single electrical pulse and can be fabricated to embody a code, which code provides for a passive autocorrelation of a SAW input to the IDT and thereby lends itself to further application as a signal generator in a communication device. However, internal dimensions of IDTs are inversely proportional to operating frequency, such that high frequency IDTs present significant manufacturing difficulties. Fabrication of IDTs for high frequency applications is simplified by exploiting a harmonic frequency SAW generated by IDTs. An IDT may therefore be designed according to fundamental frequency internal dimension criteria but can operate at a multiple of the fundamental frequency, thereby providing much higher frequency operation than conventional SAW systems. A communication system based on SAW harmonic techniques would be low-cost, low-power, small and simple alternative to known short range communications schemes, including for example the Bluetooth solution. Operation of a second harmonic SAW system at 2.4 GHz based on a fundamental frequency of 1.2 GHz is contemplated.

The burner has an electrically powered torch (12) which generates a continuous plasma which expands into a devolatilisation zone (26) of the burner, and primary conduits (28) are provided for directing a primary supply of dense phase pulverised coal into the devolatilisation zone (26). The burner is constructed also to include a combustion zone (27) which surrounds the devolatilisation zone (26), and secondary conduits (31) are provided for directing a secondary supply of pulverised coal into the combustion zone (27) along with a supply of combustion supporting air. In operation of the burner the secondary supply of pulverised coal is entrained in the air and is carried into the combustion zone (27) by way of a swirl device (25) and, once in the combustion zone, the coal-air mixture is contacted by partially combusted volatiles and carbon particles that move radially outward from the devolatilisation zone (26).",UNIV SYDNEY;;ELECTRICITY COMMISSION OF NEW,CAMPBELL BRIAN;;FAREMAN CRAIG;;VIERBOOM PETER,,https://lens.org/122-412-536-410-994,Granted Patent,no,0,0,19,19,0,F23D1/00;;F23D2207/00;;F23C5/00;;F23D1/00;;F23D2207/00,F23C99/00;;F23D1/00;;F23D1/02,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    SAW devices such as interdigital transducers (IDTs) have been widely used in RADAR applications and as filters. An IDT produces a SAW when excited by a single electrical pulse and can be fabricated to embody a code, which code provides for a passive autocorrelation of a SAW input to the IDT and thereby lends itself to further application as a signal generator in a communication device. However, conventional SAW expanders and compressors typically have insertion losses greater than 20 dB, which can have a profound effect on an RF link budget in a communication system. Insertion losses are drastically reduced by using a single phase unidirectional transducer (SPUDT-type) instead of a conventional IDT as a SAW expander/compressor. A SPUDT-type reflects SAW components which are lost in conventional IDT designs so that a stronger SAW is directed toward a transmission element. In a receiver, a SPUDT-type directs a stronger SAW toward a compressor IDT. A communication system based on SPUDT-type techniques would be low-cost, low-power, small and simple alternative to known short range communications schemes, including for example the BLUETOOTH solution. Operation of a SAW system at a frequency of 2.4 GHz is contemplated.

   A capacitive touch detector comprises means to improve selectivitya narrow band buffer. Means for reducing the effect of noise comprise capacitive coupling of the buffer into the detector, which comprises a plurality of sensor pads of different inherent capacitances and means to approximate impedances which include said capacitances and are adapted to operate at respective frequencies to approximate the impedances. At least two multiplexers are arranged in series to lower capacitance loading of the sensor pads. A synchronous demodulator is arranged to be connected as a tracking filter to track the frequency of a capacitance-measuring signal from one to another of the sensor pads, possibly during a scan thereof. 

   A controller is connected to a number of pads or capacitive sensing zones by way of buffered multiplexer chips and, shielded connectors and cables. The buffered multiplexer chips can be cascaded in series or wired in parallel and are driven from a level translator which can in its simplest form comprise a resistor and capacitor network but should preferably comprise active elements. This ensures that the base voltage on (the voltage first applied in a halfwave to) a sensor pad is also applied to its shield and various parts (e.g. power supply rails, control port, chip substrate) of its associated multiplexer/s. The signals derived from this electronic scanning array are then further processed by a signal processor incorporating a microprocessor. The improvements relate to obtaining and processing the signal both in the analogue and digital domains and allow more reliable touch detection, including interpolation methods.

An IDT produces a SAW when excited by a single electrical pulse and can be fabricated to embody a code, which code provides for a passive autocorrelation of a SAW input to the IDT and thereby lends itself t o further application as a signal generator in a communication device. However, intern al dimensions of IDTs are inversely proportional to operating frequency, such that high frequency IDTs present significant manufacturing difficulties. Fabrication of IDTs for high frequency applications is simplified by exploiting a harmonic frequency SAW generated by IDTs. An IDT may therefore be designed according to fundamental frequency internal dimension criteria but can operate at a multiple of the fundamental frequency, thereby providing much higher frequency operation than conventional SAW systems. A communication system based on SAW harmonic techniques would be low-cost, low-power, small and simple alternative to known short range communications schemes, including for examp le the Bluetooth TM solution. Operation of a second harmonic SAW system at 2.4 GHz based on a fundamental frequency of 1.2 GHz is contemplated.",RESEARCH IN MOTION LTD,CAMPBELL COLIN K;;EDMONSON PETER J,,https://lens.org/147-100-546-819-085,Granted Patent,no,0,0,19,19,0,G01S13/755;;H03H9/0028;;H03H9/0042;;H03H9/6406;;H03H9/6406;;H03H9/0028;;G01S13/755;;H03H9/0042,H03H9/64;;G01S13/75;;H03H9/00;;H04B7/005;;H04R17/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Solidifying material such as cement is inserted into the space (16) between the upper and lower sides, and the addition of liquid, e.g. water, can cause its solidification. Prior to solidification the fabric is flexible and it is possible to shape it, but after the material in the space (16) is solidified, the fabric becomes hard, and it can be used as a structural element in a wide range of applications. The lower layer (10) comprises a protruding part (24), which protrudes from the lower side (12) and is connected to the upper side via the elastic connecting fibers (26), which attract the protruding part to the other side, thereby at least partially closing the space on the edge of the fabric and preventing pouring out the solidifying material. Furthermore, the package of the solidifying material and the maximum space between the sides is such that only a predetermined amount of liquid can be placed in the space, and this amount corresponds to the amount of water required for solidification of cement.EFFECT: providing knitted volumetric fabric.12 cl, 4 dwg",CONCRETE CANVAS TECHNOLODY LTD,CRAWFORD WILLIAM CAMPBELL;;BREWIN PETER ERIC,,https://lens.org/152-643-510-746-840,Granted Patent,no,0,5,63,65,0,B32B3/12;;B32B3/22;;B32B5/02;;B32B5/06;;B32B1/00;;D04B21/14;;E02B3/12;;E04C5/07;;D10B2403/021;;D10B2403/02421;;Y10T428/23;;Y10T428/13;;Y10T428/234;;Y10T428/24488;;Y10T428/232;;Y10T428/249954;;Y10T428/23914;;Y10T428/249968;;Y10T442/413;;Y10T428/249962;;Y10T428/23921;;Y02A50/00;;B05D7/24;;B32B5/06;;B32B5/26;;B32B13/14;;D04B21/14;;D06M11/83;;E02B3/12;;E04C5/07;;D10B2403/021;;D10B2403/02421;;B32B3/12;;D04B21/14;;B05D7/24;;B29C53/005;;B32B5/06;;B32B5/26;;B32B13/14;;E02B3/12;;E04C5/07;;Y10T428/23;;Y10T428/13;;Y10T428/234;;Y10T428/24488;;Y10T428/232;;Y10T428/249954;;Y10T428/23914;;Y10T428/249968;;Y10T442/413;;Y10T428/249962;;Y10T428/23921;;B32B3/02;;D04B21/14;;E02B3/12;;E04C5/07;;D10B2403/021;;D10B2403/02421;;B32B5/26;;B32B13/14;;B05D7/24;;B29C53/005;;B32B5/06;;B28B19/00;;B28B23/0006;;B32B5/026;;B32B2250/02;;B32B2250/20;;B32B2260/023;;B32B2260/044;;B32B2307/3065;;B32B2307/712;;B32B2307/7246;;B32B2307/7265;;B32B2419/00;;B32B2451/00;;B32B2556/00;;B32B2605/12;;C04B7/32;;C04B40/0067;;D06B1/12;;D06B3/10;;D06B2700/27;;D06M11/83;;D06M23/08;;D06M2200/30;;D10B2505/02;;D10B2505/12;;D10B2505/18;;E02B3/122;;E04B1/94;;E04G23/0281,D04B21/14,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Temperature responsive actuating elements. ASSOCIATED ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES Ltd. Oct. 21, 1966 [Oct. 25, 1965], No. 45097/65. Heading G1D. [ Also in Division D1] A washing machine water inlet control comprises a thermo-responsive capsule 2 containing a heat expansible wax 3 which controls an actuating member 4 coupled to inlet valve 10 which is opened when capsule 2 is heated by an electric heater 17 and closed either by de-energization of the heater 17 and if necessary subsequent cooling by the admitted water of capsule 2 or only by cooling by the admitted water. The capsule 2 which is mounted in the washing machine tubs contains rubbery material 3' surrounded by the wax 3. Member 4 extends through an O-ring seal 8 into valve chamber 9 and carries valve 10 which closes a port between inlet port 11 and port 12 leading to the tub. Valve 10 is biased closed by spring 6 engaging seal 8 and a collar 22 on member 4 which may also engage the actuating arm 21 of a micro switch 19. In operation, a switch (18, Fig. 3, not shown), is closed to energize the heater 17 and valve 10 is opened. When the tub has filled to level Z switch (18) is opened and the tub fills to level Y while capsule 2 is cooling and if switch 18 fails to open the valve will still be closed by the cooling of the capsule. If switch 19 is provided, switch (18) may open after the initial opening of valve 10 and switch 19 will maintain the heater energized until the capsule 3 is cooled by the incoming water.",ASS ELECT IND,CAMPBELL PETER WALKER;;BYFORD GEORGE PLEDGER,,https://lens.org/097-593-706-523-053,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,D06F39/087;;D06F39/087,D06F39/08,D1A AB17          AB17;;D1A ACD           ACD;;D1A AN1D          AB17;;D1A AQ2D1         AB17;;D1A AQ2D4         AB17;;D1A AW1           AB17;;D1A AW2           AB17;;G1D D13B4         -;;G1D D13E          D13B,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

An IDT produces a SAW when excited by a single electrical pulse and can be fabricated to embody a code, which code provides for a passive autocorrelation of a SAW input to the IDT and thereby lends itself t o further application as a signal generator in a communication device. However, intern al dimensions of IDTs are inversely proportional to operating frequency, such that high frequency IDTs present significant manufacturing difficulties. Fabrication of IDTs for high frequency applications is simplified by exploiting a harmonic frequency SAW generated by IDTs. An IDT may therefore be designed according to fundamental frequency internal dimension criteria but can operate at a multiple of the fundamental frequency, thereby providing much higher frequency operation than conventional SAW systems. A communication system based on SAW harmonic techniques would be low-cost, low-power, small and simple alternative to known short range communications schemes, including for examp le the Bluetooth TM solution. Operation of a second harmonic SAW system at 2.4 GHz based on a fundamental frequency of 1.2 GHz is contemplated.",RESEARCH IN MOTION LTD,EDMONSON PETER J;;CAMPBELL COLIN K,,https://lens.org/184-653-032-448-602,Patent Application,no,0,0,19,19,0,G01S13/755;;H03H9/0028;;H03H9/0042;;H03H9/6406;;H03H9/6406;;H03H9/0028;;G01S13/755;;H03H9/0042,G01S13/75;;H03H9/00;;H03H9/64,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    An adaptive tuning method for a wireless communication device determines the impedance of a matching circuit relative to an impedance to be matched and adjusts the impedance of the matching circuit accordingly. A passive surface acoustic wave (SAW) device includes multiple terminated interdigital transducers (IDTs) which generate reflected SAWs when excited by incident SAWs, each reflected SAW having magnitude and phase characteristics dependent upon the particular IDT termination. According to the invention, the IDT terminations include the impedance matching circuit and the impedance to be matched. Input IDTs in the SAW device are excited with electrical signals, which are converted to generate the incident SAWs. The resultant reflected SAWs are converted by output IDTs into output electrical signal signals which can then be analyzed to determine magnitude and phase differences between the output electrical signal signals and generate an impedance matching circuit control signal based thereon.

An IDT produces a SAW when excited by a single electrical pulse and can be fabricated to embody a code, which code provides for a passive autocorrelation of a SAW input to the IDT and thereby lends itself to further application as a signal generator in a communication device. However, conventional SAW expanders and compressors typically have insertion losses greater than 20 dB, which can have a profound effect on an RF link budget in a communication system. Insertion losses are drastically reduced by using a single phase unidirectional transducer (SPUDT-type) instead of a conventional IDT as a SAW expander/compressor. A SPUDT-type reflects SAW components which are lost in conventional IDT designs so that a stronger SAW is directed toward a transmission element. In a receiver, a SPUDT-type directs a stronger SAW toward a compressor IDT.

An IDT produces a SAW when excited by a single electrical pulse and can be fabricated to embody a code, which code provides for a passive autocorrelation of a SAW input to the IDT and thereby lends itself to further application as a signal generator in a communication device. However, internal dimensions of IDTs are inversely proportional to operating frequency, such that high frequency IDTs present significant manufacturing difficulties. Fabrication of IDTs for high frequency applications is simplified by exploiting a harmonic frequency SAW generated by IDTs. An IDT may therefore be designed according to fundamental frequency internal dimension criteria but can operate at a multiple of the fundamental frequency, thereby providing much higher frequency operation than conventional SAW systems. A communication system based on SAW harmonic techniques would be low-cost, low-power, small and simple alternative to known short range communications schemes, including for example the BIuetooth TM solution. Operation of a second harmonic SAW system at 2.4 GHz based on a fundamental frequency of 1.2 GHz is contemplated. <IMAGE>",RESEARCH IN MOTION LTD,EDMONSON PETER J;;CAMPBELL COLIN K,,https://lens.org/198-960-503-765-750,Granted Patent,no,0,0,19,19,0,G01S13/755;;H03H9/0028;;H03H9/0042;;H03H9/6406;;H03H9/6406;;H03H9/0028;;G01S13/755;;H03H9/0042,H03H9/64;;G01S13/75;;H03H9/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

An IDT produces a SAW when excited by a single electrical pulse and can be fabricated to embody a code, which code provides for a passive autocorrelation of a SAW input to the IDT and thereby lends itself to further application as a signal generator in a communication device. However, conventional SAW expanders and compressors typically have insertion losses greater than 20 dB, which can have a profound effect on an RF link budget in a communication system. Insertion losses are drastically reduced by using a single phase unidirectional transducer (SPUDT-type) instead of a conventional IDT as a SAW expander/compressor. A SPUDT-type reflects SAW components which are lost in conventional IDT designs so that a stronger SAW is directed toward a transmission element. In a receiver, a SPUDT-type directs a stronger SAW toward a compressor IDT. A communication system based on SPUDT-type techniques would be low-cost, low-power, small and simple alternative to known short range communications schemes, including for example the Bluetooth TM solution.

Means for reducing the effect of noise comprise capacitive coupling of the buffer into the detector, which comprises a plurality of sensor pads of different inherent capacitances and means to approximate impedances which include said capacitances and are adapted to operate at respective frequencies to approximate the impedances. At least two multiplexers are arranged in series to lower capacitance loading of the sensor pads. A synchronous demodulator is arranged to be connected as a tracking filter to track the frequency of a capacitance-measuring signal from one to another of the sensor pads, possibly during a scan thereof. A controller is connected to a number of pads or capacitive sensing zones by way of buffered multiplexer chips and, shielded connectors and cables. The buffered multiplexer chips can be cascaded in series or wired in parallel and are driven from a level translator which can in its simplest form comprise a resistor and capacitor network but should preferably comprise active elements. This ensures that the base voltage on (the voltage first applied in a halfwave to) a sensor pad is also applied to its shield and various parts (e.g. power supply rails, control port, chip substrate) of its associated multiplexer/s. The signals derived from this electronic scanning array are then further processed by a signal processor incorporating a microprocessor. The improvements relate to obtaining and processing the signal both in the analogue and digital domains and allow more reliable touch detection, including interpolation methods.",MOONSTONE TECHN LTD;;TAGG JAMES PETER;;CAMPBELL ALASTAIR JAMES,TAGG JAMES PETER;;CAMPBELL ALASTAIR JAMES,,https://lens.org/002-045-408-091-009,Patent Application,yes,4,48,5,5,0,G01V3/088;;G01V3/088;;G06F3/04164;;G06F3/04164;;G06F3/04166;;G06F3/04166;;G06F3/0445;;G06F3/0445;;H03K17/9622;;H03K17/9622,G01V3/08;;H03K17/96,,0,0,,,,PENDING

An IDT produces a SAW when excited by a single electrical pulse and can be fabricated to embody a code, which code provides for a passive autocorrelation of a SAW input to the IDT and thereby lends itself to further application as a signal generator in a communication device. However, conventional SAW expanders and compressors typically have insertion losses greater than 20 dB, which can have a profound effect on an RF link budget in a communication system. Insertion losses are drastically reduced by using a single phase unidirectional transducer (SPUDT-type) instead of a conventional IDT as a SAW expander/compressor. A SPUDT-type reflects SAW components which are lost in conventional IDT designs so that a stronger SAW is directed toward a transmission element. In a receiver, a SPUDT-type directs a stronger SAW toward a compressor IDT. A communication system based on SPUDT-type techniques would be low-cost, low-power, small and simple alternative to known short range communications schemes, including for example the Bluetooth TM solution. Operation of a SAW system at a frequency of 2.4 GHz is contemplated.",RESEARCH IN MOTION LTD,CAMPBELL COLIN K;;EDMONSON PETER J,"BLACKBERRY LIMITED, WATERLOO, CA (2014-09-25)",https://lens.org/121-840-184-137-916,Granted Patent,yes,3,2,14,14,0,G01S13/755;;H03H9/0274;;H03H9/14505;;H03H9/44;;H03H9/44;;H03H9/14505;;G01S13/755;;H03H9/0274,H03H9/64;;G01S13/75;;H03H9/00;;H03H9/02;;H03H9/145,,2,0,,,"HODE J M ET AL: ""APPLICATION OF LOW LOSS S.A.W.

Until set, the fabric is flexible and can be shaped but after the material in space has set, the fabric is rigid and can be used as a structural element in a wide range of situations. The bottom layer has an extension that extends beyond the upper face and is connected to the upper face by elastic connecting fibres that draw the extension towards the other face, thereby at least partly closing the space at the edge of the cloth and preventing the settable material from spilling out.

However, internal dimensions of IDTs are inversely proportional to operating frequency, such that high frequency IDTs present significant manufacturing difficulties. Fabrication of IDTs for high frequency applications is simplified by exploiting a harmonic frequency SAW generated by IDTs. An IDT may therefore be designed according to fundamental frequency internal dimension criteria but can operate at a multiple of the fundamental frequency, thereby providing much higher frequency operation than conventional SAW systems. Operation of a second harmonic SAW system at 2.4 GHz based on a fundamental frequency of 1.2 GHz is contemplated.",EDMONSON PETER J;;CAMPBELL COLIN K,EDMONSON PETER J;;CAMPBELL COLIN K,BLACKBERRY LIMITED (2013-07-09);;MALIKIE INNOVATIONS LIMITED (2023-05-11),https://lens.org/023-975-904-098-19X,Patent Application,yes,43,4,19,19,0,G01S13/755;;H03H9/0028;;H03H9/0042;;H03H9/6406;;H03H9/6406;;H03H9/0028;;G01S13/755;;H03H9/0042,H04B7/00;;G01S13/75;;H03H9/00;;H03H9/64;;H04M1/00;;H04Q7/20,455/41.2;;342/175;;367/140;;381/151;;455/426.1,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

An IDT produces a SAW when excited by a single electrical pulse and can be fabricated to embody a code, which code provides for a passive autocorrelation of a SAW input to the IDT and thereby lends itself to further application as a signal generator in a communication device. However, conventional SAW expanders and compressors typically have insertion losses greater than 20 dB, which can have a profound effect on an RF link budget in a communication system. Insertion losses are drastically reduced by using a single phase unidirectional transducer (SPUDT-type) instead of a conventional IDT as a SAW expander/compressor. A SPUDT-type reflects SAW components which are lost in conventional IDT designs so that a stronger SAW is directed toward a transmission element. In a receiver, a SPUDT-type directs a stronger SAW toward a compressor IDT. A communication system based on SPUDT-type techniques would be low-cost, low-power, small and simple alternative to known short range communications schemes, including for example the Bluetooth TM solution.

An IDT produces a SAW when excited by a single electrical pulse and can be fabricated to embody a code, which code provides for a passive autocorrelation of a SAW input to the IDT and thereby lends itself to further application as a signal generator in a communication device. However, conventional SAW expanders and compressors typically have insertion losses greater than 20 dB, which can have a profound effect on an RF link budget in a communication system. Insertion losses are drastically reduced by using a single phase unidirectional transducer (SPUDT-type) instead of a conventional IDT as a SAW expander/compressor. A SPUDT-type reflects SAW components which are lost in conventional IDT designs so that a stronger SAW is directed toward a transmission element. In a receiver, a SPUDT-type directs a stronger SAW toward a compressor IDT. A communication system based on SPUDT-type techniques would be low-cost, low-power, small and simple alternative to known short range communications schemes, including for example the Bluetooth TM solution.

However, conventional SAW expanders and compressors typically have insertion losses greater than 20 dB, which can have a profound effect on an RF link budget in a communication system. Insertion losses are drastically reduced by using a single phase unidirectional transducer (SPUDT-type) instead of a conventional IDT as a SAW expander/compressor. A SPUDT-type reflects SAW components which are lost in conventional IDT designs so that a stronger SAW is directed toward a transmission element. In a receiver, a SPUDT-type directs a stronger SAW toward a compressor IDT.

An IDT produces a SAW when excited by a single electrical pulse and can be fabricated to embody a code, which code provides for a passive autocorrelation of a SAW input to the IDT and thereby lends itself to further application as a signal generator in a communication device. However, internal dimensions of IDTs are inversely proportional to operating frequency, such that high frequency IDTs present significant manufacturing difficulties. Fabrication of IDTs for high frequency applications is simplified by exploiting a harmonic frequency SAW generated by IDTs. An IDT may therefore be designed according to fundamental frequency internal dimension criteria but can operate at a multiple of the fundamental frequency, thereby providing much higher frequency operation than conventional SAW systems. A communication system based on SAW harmonic techniques would be low-cost, low-power, small and simple alternative to known short range communications schemes, including for example the BIuetooth TM solution.

In addition, the packing of the settable material and maximum space between the faces are such that only a predetermined amount of liquid can be accommodated within the space and that amount is matched to the water required to set the cement.",CONCRETE CANVAS TECH LTD,CRAWFORD WILLIAM CAMPBELL;;BREWIN PETER ERIC,CONCRETE CANVAS TECHNOLOGY LTD (2011-08-30),https://lens.org/115-275-324-810-791,Patent Application,yes,4,2,63,65,0,B32B3/12;;B32B3/22;;B32B5/02;;B32B5/06;;B32B1/00;;D04B21/14;;E02B3/12;;E04C5/07;;D10B2403/021;;D10B2403/02421;;Y10T428/23;;Y10T428/13;;Y10T428/234;;Y10T428/24488;;Y10T428/232;;Y10T428/249954;;Y10T428/23914;;Y10T428/249968;;Y10T442/413;;Y10T428/249962;;Y10T428/23921;;Y02A50/00;;B05D7/24;;B32B5/06;;B32B5/26;;B32B13/14;;D04B21/14;;D06M11/83;;E02B3/12;;E04C5/07;;D10B2403/021;;D10B2403/02421;;B32B3/12;;D04B21/14;;B05D7/24;;B29C53/005;;B32B5/06;;B32B5/26;;B32B13/14;;E02B3/12;;E04C5/07;;Y10T428/23;;Y10T428/13;;Y10T428/234;;Y10T428/24488;;Y10T428/232;;Y10T428/249954;;Y10T428/23914;;Y10T428/249968;;Y10T442/413;;Y10T428/249962;;Y10T428/23921;;B32B3/02;;D04B21/14;;E02B3/12;;E04C5/07;;D10B2403/021;;D10B2403/02421;;B32B5/26;;B32B13/14;;B05D7/24;;B29C53/005;;B32B5/06;;B28B19/00;;B28B23/0006;;B32B5/026;;B32B2250/02;;B32B2250/20;;B32B2260/023;;B32B2260/044;;B32B2307/3065;;B32B2307/712;;B32B2307/7246;;B32B2307/7265;;B32B2419/00;;B32B2451/00;;B32B2556/00;;B32B2605/12;;C04B7/32;;C04B40/0067;;D06B1/12;;D06B3/10;;D06B2700/27;;D06M11/83;;D06M23/08;;D06M2200/30;;D10B2505/02;;D10B2505/12;;D10B2505/18;;E02B3/122;;E04B1/94;;E04G23/0281,D06M11/83;;B28B19/00;;B28B23/00;;B32B5/02;;B32B5/06;;B32B5/26;;C04B7/32;;C04B40/00;;D04B21/14;;D06B1/12;;D06B3/10;;D06M23/08;;E02B3/12;;E04B1/94;;E04C5/07;;E04G23/02,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

An IDT produces a SAW when excited by a single electrical pulse and can be fabricated to embody a code, which code provides for a passive autocorrelation of a SAW input to the IDT and thereby lends itself to further application as a signal generator in a communication device. However, internal dimensions of IDTs are inversely proportional to operating frequency, such that high frequency IDTs present significant manufacturing difficulties. Fabrication of IDTs for high frequency applications is simplified by exploiting a harmonic frequency SAW generated by IDTs. An IDT may therefore be designed according to fundamental frequency internal dimension criteria but can operate at a multiple of the fundamental frequency, thereby providing much higher frequency operation than conventional SAW systems. A communication system based on SAW harmonic techniques would be low-cost, low-power, small and simple alternative to known short range communications schemes, including for example the BIuetooth TM solution. Operation of a second harmonic SAW system at 2.4 GHz based on a fundamental frequency of 1.2 GHz is contemplated. <IMAGE>",RESEARCH IN MOTION LTD,EDMONSON PETER J;;CAMPBELL COLIN K,"BLACKBERRY LIMITED, WATERLOO, CA (2014-09-25)",https://lens.org/125-323-118-762-027,Granted Patent,yes,1,3,19,19,0,G01S13/755;;H03H9/0028;;H03H9/0042;;H03H9/6406;;H03H9/6406;;H03H9/0028;;G01S13/755;;H03H9/0042,H03H9/64;;G01S13/75;;H03H9/00,,2,0,,,"SAW C B ET AL: ""IMPROVED DESIGN OF SINGLE-PHASE INIDIRECTIONAL TRANSDUCERS FOR LOW-LOSS SAW FILTERS"" PROCEEDINGS OF THE ULTRASONICS SYMPOSIUM.

This method may be used in the treatment of many diseases and disorders which require the opening of the blood brain barrier and/or blood retinal barrier. Such methods generally involve the use of an RNAi-inducing agent, such as siRNA, miRNA, shRNA or an RNAi-inducing vector whose presence within a cell results in production of an siRNA or shRNA, targeting tight junction proteins to open the blood brain barrier and/or blood retinal barrier.

PRISMO UNIVERSAL Ltd. 28 Dec., 1967 [28 Dec., 1966], No. 57982/66. Heading G4D. [Also in Division E1] In a vehicle for spraying continuous or intermittent road marking lines, a rear spray gun 25 powered by a compressor 15 sprays reflective material (e.g. ballotini) from a pressurized container 17 on to a strip of hot thermoplastic material deposited by a spray gun 24 from a heated storage unit 16, the guns 24, 25 being switched on and off by a solenoid-operated valve, Fig. 3 (not shown), controlled by an electronic cup-and-bucket counter, Fig. 5 operated by pulses from a reed switch 35 adjacent a ring of magnets 34 driven by a retractable road-engaging wheel 33. The vehicle includes a rear operator's control panel 18. The road surface ahead of the marking line may be sprayed with a wider strip of adhesive either by a gun 23 on the front of the vehicle or by an ancillary vehicle. For an intermittent line the counter automatically maintains a selected mark/space pattern irrespective of vehicle speed, the pattern being selected by ganged rotary switches 70 which determine both the number of pulses during which the guns 24, 25 are spraying and the number during which they are not spraying.

The accuracy of a selected mark/space ratio can be checked by observing this light while a manual switch 98 is repeatedly closed to apply pulses to the counter, switches 72, 83 being provided to disconnect the reed switch and spray guns. The counter circuit also includes a manual operating switch 84 and manual re-setting switches 91 93 for the beginning of a line or space. The spray guns 24, 25 (which may be duplicated for a wider mark) are mounted on a castorwheel carriage 26 carried by links 28 and a transverse slide 31. A laterally-adjustable adhesive spray gun 23 and a road-cleaning air jet 22 are mounted on a horizontally-pivoted guide arm 11. The jet 22 may be replaced by a rotary brush or sponge roller. The reflective ballotini are sprayed in excess to protect the hot thermoplastic from vehicle tyres. In order to allow for nearside, centre or offside road marking the vehicle cab 14 has dual controls and alternative operator seats are provided adjacent the control panel 18. Within the unit 16 thermoplastic, e.g. as in Specification 1,190,746, is melted by circulating oil at 400 F., the hot oil also circulating around the gun 24 and its feed pipe, and through jacketed storage vessels in the unit. In a modified vehicle, Figs. 6, 7 (not shown), the melter unit is replaced by heated storage vessels having stirring means for molten thermoplastic delivered by an ancillary vehicle.",PRISMO UNIVERSAL LTD,HARDING JOHN;;CAMPBELL SIDNEY GLENROY;;PLACZEK PETER,,https://lens.org/114-158-630-579-410,Granted Patent,no,0,8,8,8,0,E01C23/166;;E01C23/222;;E01C23/222;;E01C23/166,E01C23/16;;E01C23/22;;E04F21/24,E1G GLX           GLX;;E1G G64A3         G64;;E1G G64B2         -;;E1G G64CX         G64;;E1G G64C2         -;;E1G G772          GLX;;E1G G781          GLX;;G4D DAX           AX;;G4D D1D11         -;;G4D D1D13         -;;G4D D431          AX;;G4D D6C1          D1B3;;G4D D6C2          D1B3;;G4D D6M3          D1B3;;G4D D6Y           D1B3,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

March 31, 1960 [April 1, 1959], No. 11062/59. Class 39 (4) In a heterogeneous nuclear reactor, water flows upwards through the core and acts as both coolant and moderator. The core is formed of vertical fuel and control rods supported at their ends, within the cylindrical pressure vessel, by an upper and a lower lattice which permit the coolant flow, each compartment of the lattice being charged with a fuel element or control rod. As shown, water flows into pressure vessel 1 through inlet 14 and part moves upwards through passages 18, 28, 52 and by apertures 19, 26 into compartments 51 of the upper core support 37. From 51, water flows through apertures 47 in plate 45 through the fuel element chambers 31 into the lower chamber 67. Further coolant from 14 flows downwardly through passage 72 and enters 67 through orifices 73. From 67, part of the coolant flows upwards through orifices 74 over the outside of the control rods 32, into chamber 95 and the remainder passes upwardly through the inner fuel element chambers 31 through tubes 80 to 95. The coolant discharges from 95 to the outlets 13. Each control rod 32 has a lower follow up section 34 of low neutron capture cross-section material and each fuel element chamber container 56 is substantially surrounded by the control rod ribs 33.

    A process and system for blocking unnecessary callbacks to empty paint methods of graphical user interface components is provided. The process initializes a platform-dependent peer class corresponding to a platform-independent class for the graphical user interface component and stores a value representing whether the platform-independent class extends a standard platform-independent class for the graphical user interface component. A platform-dependent paint method determines whether a callback to a paint method is necessary for processing of the paint event. The callback determination is performed by checking the stored value representing the extension of the standard graphics class for the component. If a callback is necessary, then the native paint method initiates a callback to the paint method of the platform-dependent peer object. The native paint method may be implemented in the C programming language, and the platform-dependent peer class and the platform-independent class may be implemented in the Java programming language.

The connector connects coolant system circulating to an electrical component thereby allowing the coolant to circulate through the electrical component. The connector is made up of two components, a component side connector and a pump side connector, and can be in three positions: disengaged, semi-engaged and fully-engaged. An electrical component can be drained of its coolant while the connector is shifted from the fully- engaged position, to the semi-engaged position and to the disengaged position. This can be accomplished without shutting down the negative pressure coolant system, thus allowing a particular electrical component to be disconnected without affecting the cooling efficiency of other electrical components connected to the system. Because the coolant is drained, it will not spill on the electrical component and cause damage.",CHILLDYNE INC,HARRINGTON STEVE;;DEANGELIS PETER C;;CAMPBELL WILLIAM C,,https://lens.org/043-961-320-103-299,Patent Application,yes,5,0,3,3,0,G06F1/20;;H05K7/20836;;G06F2200/201;;Y10T137/048;;Y10T137/9029;;Y10T137/87161;;Y10T137/87925;;H05K7/20281;;Y10T137/048;;Y10T137/9029;;Y10T137/87161;;Y10T137/87925;;G06F1/20;;H05K7/20836;;G06F2200/201;;H05K7/20272,G05D23/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Flow control means (28, 105) responsive to braking induced torque transmitted to the pressure plate (7) only allows coolant to be pumped during braking. The flow control means (28, 101) is provided in a projecting lug (17) of the pressure plate (7) and co-operates with an adjacent corresponding lug (19) on the housing (3) with which it is urged into engagement during braking. The flow control means can be a valve (28) in a cooling liquid supply line (21) between the reservoir (20) and the pump (P) which isolates the pump from the reservoir when no braking occurs, or it can be a switch (101) which only activates the pump during braking. A temperature sensitive flow valve (35), such as a bi-metallic strip (39) could also be incorporated.

As an optional optimization, where a threshold number of duplicate samples are observed during page-level sampling, the number of distinct values in the overall population data is presumed to be the number of distinct values in the sample data. Also, during estimation of distinct values of an overall population, a “Chao” estimator can optionally be utilized as a lower bound of the estimate. The resulting estimate is then used when scaling, which can take domain knowledge of the data being scaled into account in order to prevent scaled estimates from exceeding the limits of the domain. Also, a “sum of the parts” mathematical relationship can be taken into account during scaling that the sum of the scaled distinct values for each bin of an estimate histogram should total an estimate for the total distinct values of the entire population.",FRASER CAMPBELL BRYCE;;JOSE IAN;;ZABBACK PETER ALFRED;;MICROSOFT CORP,FRASER CAMPBELL BRYCE;;JOSE IAN;;ZABBACK PETER ALFRED,MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (2006-09-01),https://lens.org/111-854-704-205-252,Granted Patent,yes,6,10,4,4,0,G06F17/18;;G06F17/18;;G06F16/24545;;G06F16/24545,G06F17/30,707/713;;702/180,3,0,,,"OA dated Mar. 6, 2009 for U.S. Appl.

The connector connects coolant system circulating to an electrical component thereby allowing the coolant to circulate through the electrical component. The connector is made up of two components, a component side connector and a pump side connector, and can be in three positions: disengaged, semi-engaged and fully-engaged. An electrical component can be drained of its coolant while the connector is shifted from the fully-engaged position, to the semi-engaged position and to the disengaged position. This can be accomplished without shutting down the negative pressure coolant system, thus allowing a particular electrical component to be disconnected without affecting the cooling efficiency of other electrical components connected to the system.

The data processing apparatus comprises of plurality of memory units 24, 34 for storing data values, a processor core 10 for issuing an access request specifying an access to be made to the memory units in relation to a data value, and a memory controller (MMU) 70 for performing the access specified by the access request. Attribute generation logic (200, Fig 2) is provided in the MMU for determining from the access request one or more predetermined attributes verifying which of the memory units should be used when performing the access. However, the memory controller 70 does not wait until such determination has been performed by the attribute generation logic (200) before beginning the access. Instead, prediction logic (210) in the MMU is arranged to predict the one or more predetermined attributes, and clock generation logic is responsive to the predictive predetermined attributes from the prediction logic to select which one of the memory units is to be clocked during performance of the access, and to issue a clock signal to that memory unit. Checking logic (220) in the MMU is then provided to determine whether the predetermined attributes generated by the attribute generation logic agree with the predicted predetermined attributes, and if not, to reinitiate the access, in which event the clock generation logic is arranged to reselect one of the memory units using the predetermined attributes as determined by the attribute generation logic. This approach enables high speed processing of access requests, whilst achieving significant power savings over prior art systems where multiple memory units are clocked speculatively in parallel.",ADVANCED RISC MACH LTD,MIDDLETON PETER GUY;;BULL DAVID MICHAEL;;CAMPBELL GARY,,https://lens.org/117-964-838-785-374,Patent Application,no,0,9,7,7,0,G06F12/0215;;G06F12/0888;;Y02D10/00;;G06F12/0888;;G06F12/0215;;Y02D10/00,G06F12/02;;G06F12/06;;G06F12/08;;G06F12/0888;;G06F12/10,G4A AMX           MX,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The inner end of the pull-rod (42) is provided with an eye (50) of which the inner side of the outermost end has a rocking and sliding engagement with a complementary arcuate face defining a notch (49) in the innermost edge of the longer arm (43) of the lever (41). The coupling between the pull-rod (42) and the lever (41) enables the pull-rod (42) to adopt a substantially radial alignment with the brake centre of rotation, even when brake lining wear progressively increases the brake forward to reverse articulation. The lever (41) is pivotally mounted on one of the pressure plates (5) by means of a pivot pin (45), and has a cranked nose (47) which is received within the groove in the other pressure plate (6). In order to prevent the lever (41) from twisting when the brake is applied, the lever reacts against reaction faces (63 and 64) of which the face (63) comprises a wall defining the outer side of the groove (60). and the face (64) comprises a region on the pressure plate (5) on the radially outermost side of the pin (45).",LUCAS IND PLC,PRICE ANTHONY GEORGE;;CAMPBELL ROY;;GREEN ANDREW PETER,,https://lens.org/148-658-356-296-956,Patent Application,yes,0,0,5,8,0,F16D55/14;;F16D55/14;;F16D2125/36;;F16D2125/36,F16D55/14;;F16D65/14,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

    The present invention relates to a technique for accessing memory units in a data processing apparatus. The data processing apparatus comprises of plurality of memory units for storing data values, a processor core for issuing an access request specifying an access to be made to the memory units in relation to a data value, and a memory controller for performing the access specified by the access request. Attribute generation logic is provided for determining from the access request one or more predetermined attributes verifying which of the memory units should be used when performing the access. However, the memory controller does not wait until such determination has been performed by the attribute generation logic before beginning the access. Instead, prediction logic is arranged to predict the one or more predetermined attributes, and clock generation logic is responsive to the predictive predetermined attributes from the prediction logic to select which one of the memory units is to be clocked during performance of the access, and to issue a clock signal to that memory unit. Checking logic is then provided to determine whether the predetermined attributes generated by the attribute generation logic agree with the predicted predetermined attributes, and if not, to reinitiate the access, in which event the clock generation logic is arranged to reselect one of the memory units using the predetermined attributes as determined by the attribute generation logic. This approach enables high speed processing of access requests, whilst achieving significant power savings over prior art systems where multiple memory units are clocked speculatively in parallel.

As an optional optimization, where a threshold number of duplicate samples are observed during page-level sampling, the number of distinct values in the overall population data is presumed to be the number of distinct values in the sample data. Also, during estimation of distinct values of an overall population, a “Chao” estimator can optionally be utilized as a lower bound of the estimate. The resulting estimate is then used when scaling, which can take domain knowledge of the data being scaled into account in order to prevent scaled estimates from exceeding the limits of the domain. Also, a “sum of the parts” mathematical relationship can be taken into account during scaling that the sum of the scaled distinct values for each bin of an estimate histogram should total an estimate for the total distinct values of the entire population.",MICROSOFT CORP,FRASER CAMPBELL BRYCE;;JOSE IAN;;ZABBACK PETER ALFRED,MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (2006-09-01),https://lens.org/179-454-689-669-933,Patent Application,yes,6,6,4,4,0,G06F17/18;;G06F17/18;;G06F16/24545;;G06F16/24545,G06F15/18;;G06F17/30,707/713;;706/12;;X707E17017,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

To attenuate the adverse side effect of a transient burning sensation caused by capsaicin-induced neuronal excitation, the methods utilize a cooling article, such as a material wrap cooled via a circulating fluid, to reduce the temperature of tissue to be exposed to capsaicin to within a certain range for certain durations of time, optionally in combination with administering a local anesthetic agent, resulting in the substantial reduction or even elimination of transient burning sensation caused by capsaicin.",CENTREXION THERAPEUTICS CORP,CAMPBELL JAMES N;;HANSON PETER D;;STEVENS RANDALL,CENTREXION THERAPEUTICS CORPORATION (2018-09-11),https://lens.org/160-908-924-081-720,Granted Patent,yes,83,2,16,16,0,A61K31/165;;A61K31/167;;A61P29/02;;A61P19/02;;A61P19/02;;A61F7/10;;A61F2007/0042;;A61K9/0014;;A61K9/0019;;A61K31/167,A61K31/16;;A61F7/00;;A61F7/10;;A61F13/00;;A61K9/00;;A61K31/167;;A61P19/02,,36,22,027-000-145-924-248;;071-298-143-881-934;;028-861-728-253-854;;116-472-370-374-424;;030-166-020-539-045;;048-698-603-189-068;;027-000-145-924-248;;004-371-618-791-368;;156-783-946-162-192;;110-699-115-571-605;;016-270-180-268-136;;112-958-680-524-410;;000-746-510-207-45X;;017-915-287-305-760;;107-291-813-665-732;;034-021-606-439-074;;055-948-872-985-671;;096-817-747-777-694;;014-070-601-071-747;;037-262-156-614-504;;006-354-368-155-956;;020-723-951-164-559,10.1111/j.1365-2125.2009.03489.x;;pmc2780276;;19843054;;10.3390/molecules21080966;;27455231;;pmc6272969;;10.1016/j.jpain.2005.01.153;;21117501;;10.1055/s-0031-1296327;;25342957;;10.1186/1745-9974-10-6;;pmc4194457;;22188587;;10.1021/jp211172f;;10.1111/j.1365-2125.2009.03489.x;;pmc2780276;;19843054;;12226852;;10.1002/jps.10216;;10.1016/j.jpain.2017.02.356;;28637786;;10.1152/ajprenal.00097.2017;;pmc5625111;;27356469;;10.1038/srep28621;;pmc4928060;;23933232;;10.1016/j.pain.2013.08.001;;18505583;;10.1186/1745-9974-4-3;;pmc2435105;;10.1172/jci32751;;18172555;;pmc2157564;;18240098;;10.1136/annrheumdis-2017-eular.5309;;10.1271/bbb1961.55.873;;15005134;;10.1065/espr2003.12.180;;10.1016/j.brainresrev.2008.12.006;;19150372;;25246806;;10.2147/jpr.s66956;;pmc4166214;;25853954;;10.3109/13880209.2015.1021816;;10.1152/jn.1991.66.1.190;;1919666,"Akesson in “A comparison of two formulations of intradermal capsaicin as models of neuropathic pain in healthy volunteers” (2007) Master Thesis in Pharmacy; The University of Adelaide Australia.;;Basith et al., “Harnessing the Therapeutic Potential of Capsaicin and its Analogues in Pain and Other Diseases,” Molecules, pp. 1-28, (2016).;;Botz in “The role of sensory neuropeptides in mouse models of neuropathy and immune arthritis” (year 2015) University PECS, Medical School.;;Cantillon et al.

The inner end of the pull-rod (42) is provided with an eye (50) of which the inner side of the outermost end has a rocking and sliding engagement with a complementary arcuate face defining a notch (49) in the innermost edge of the longer arm (43) of the lever (41). The coupling between the pull-rod (42) and the lever (41) enables the pull-rod (42) to adopt a substantially radial alignment with the brake centre of rotation, even when brake lining wear progressively increases the brake forward to reverse articulation. The lever (41) is pivotally mounted on one of the pressure plates (5) by means of a pivot pin (45), and has a cranked nose (47) which is received within the groove in the other pressure plate (6).
