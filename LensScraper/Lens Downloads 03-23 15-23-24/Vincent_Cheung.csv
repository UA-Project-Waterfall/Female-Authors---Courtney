Sufficient energy is applied to the gas in at least the first region to excite a proportion of the gaseous component able to form plasma.",NOVELLUS SYSTEMS INC,FAIR JAMES A;;DECAUX VINCENT;;GUHA ANIRBAN;;CHEUNG DAVID;;KELLER JOHN;;JAGUSCH PETER,NOVELLUS SYSTEMS INC (2007-01-02),https://lens.org/127-735-929-521-087,Patent Application,yes,7,121,1,1,0,H01J37/32357;;H01J37/32458;;H05H1/46;;H05H1/46;;H01J37/32357;;H01J37/32458,H05H1/00,204/164,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
