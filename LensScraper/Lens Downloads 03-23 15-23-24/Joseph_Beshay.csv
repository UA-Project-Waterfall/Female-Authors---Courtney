The networked transport layer socket capability, for transport layer connection of a communication device attached to a network access device, moves the transport layer connection endpoint of the transport layer connection of the communication device (which also may be referred to as a client transport layer socket of the transport layer connection of the communication device) from the communication device into the network access device. The application client at the application layer of the communication device, rather than communicating with the client transport layer socket of the transport layer of the communication device internally within the communication device, communicates with the client transport layer socket of the transport layer of the communication device, which is provided within the network access device for the communication device, via a communication path between the communication device and the network access device.",FRANCINI ANDREA;;BESHAY JOSEPH D;;ALCATEL LUCENT,FRANCINI ANDREA;;BESHAY JOSEPH D,ALCATEL LUCENT (2016-12-06),https://lens.org/163-994-407-871-030,Patent Application,yes,8,0,1,1,0,H04L69/161;;H04L69/161;;H04L41/02,H04L29/06;;H04L12/24,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
