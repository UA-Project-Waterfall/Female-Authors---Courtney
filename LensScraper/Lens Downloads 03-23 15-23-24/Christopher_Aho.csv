Cam surfaces are formed in an inner wall of the central cavity. A retainer secured within the central cavity has an outward-facing slot. A jaw for each of the cam surfaces has a curved outer side in contact with one of the cam surfaces and a drive surface on an inner side for engaging one of the drive flanks of the nut. A foot extends inward from a lower end of each of the jaws into the slot to retain the jaws within the central cavity. Rotating the tool body relative to the jaws moves the drive surfaces of the jaws from a retracted position to a gripping position in engagement with the drive flanks of the nut.,TOOLTECH LLC,MERRICK JAKE;;TAYLOR LUCAS;;AHO CHRISTOPHER,TOOLTECH LLC (2021-08-04),https://lens.org/010-090-288-923-132,Granted Patent,yes,10,0,2,2,0,B25B13/18;;B25B13/06;;B25B13/44;;B23B31/1261;;B25B13/44;;B23B31/1612,B23B31/171;;B25B13/44,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

A recess extends through the cam surfaces. Jaws have outer sides in engagement with one of the cam surfaces and inner sides containing teeth. An outward protruding rib on the outer side of each of the jaws inserts into the recess. Rotation of the body in a first direction causes the cam surfaces to slide in the first direction along the outer sides of the jaws, pushing the jaws to a gripping position. Rotation of the body in a second direction causes the cam surfaces to slide in the second direction along the outer sides of the jaws, enabling the jaws to move to a retracted position.",TOOLTECH LLC,MERRICK JAKE;;TAYLOR LUCAS;;AHO CHRISTOPHER,TOOLTECH LLC (2021-04-08),https://lens.org/147-027-017-661-405,Patent Application,yes,1,0,2,2,0,B25B23/103;;B25B13/28;;B25B13/5008;;B25B23/103,B25B23/10;;B25B13/50,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
