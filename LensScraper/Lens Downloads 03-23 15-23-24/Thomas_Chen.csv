   An individual-well adaptive method of body bias control that mitigates the effects of D2D and WD process variations is shown. It is assumed that p-type transistors are grouped in sections. The bodies of all the p-type transistors within a section are connected to a single n-well. This section size can be small enough to provide fine-granular adjustments to the circuit without having any impact on area overhead. With a small amount of additional circuitry and routing, individual well biases can be intelligently adjusted resulting in closely controlled chip power and performance. Experimental results show that binning yields as low as 17% can be improved to greater than 90% using the proposed method.

A client application used to access a calendar system can also include integrated user interface controls for scheduling rides from a transportation service. When a ride is confirmed, the application can also request (e.g.,key card) access to a building at the ride's destination. Integrating transportation services and facility access services though a calendar system reduces context switching between different applications. Reduced context switching streamlines scheduling of transportation for events (e.g., corporate meetings), which may result in individuals requesting transportation to an event along with (or atleast closer in time to) the scheduling the event. The earlier in time a transportation service receives transportation requests, the better the transportation service can optimize resource allocation to satisfy transportation requests.",FORD GLOBAL TECH LLC,MIKULSKI THOMAS;;CHEN YIFAN,,https://lens.org/098-948-997-440-974,Patent Application,no,0,0,4,4,0,G06Q10/025;;G06F16/2428;;G06F16/24575;;G06Q10/02;;G06Q10/1095;;G06Q50/40,G06Q10/02,,0,0,,,,PENDING

    A clock-recovery system is used to align a clock-phase with the RGB-signals. A frequency-synthesizing loop is applied for receiving a reference clock signal (CKREF) to generate a synthesized frequency. A fine-tuned frequency-synthesizing loop then receives a horizontal synchronization signal (HSYNC) to fine-tune the synthesized frequency into a fine-tuned synthesized frequency. A phase divider subdivides the fine-tuned synthesized frequency into a multiple phase segments for inputting to a multiplex controller. An analog sensor, receives and senses the RGB signals for generating encoded sensing data corresponding to voltage transitions of the RGB signals. A transition detector then applies the encoded sensing data for generating transition-detection data. A threshold triggering circuit compares the transition-detection data with a threshold data and triggering a RGB-phase data upon detecting the threshold data is exceeded by the transition detection data. A phase sampling detector applies the RGB-phase data for selecting a clock-alignment phase-segment from one of the multiple phase segments received from the multiplex controller for aligning the clock-phase. A digital phase-lock loop (PLL) includes a phase shift-direction detector (PD) receives the RGB-phase data from the threshold triggering circuit and the clock-alignment phase-segment from the multiplex controller for generating a dynamic phase-shift difference. The digital PLL further includes a digital filter to receive the dynamic phase-shift difference from the PD for generating a phase-segment-shift signal for outputting to the multiplex controller for shifting the clock-alignment phase-segment to dynamically align the clock-phase.

Involved is a method to pump the condensate into one condensate receiver located at the suction side of the condensate feed pump, and to bleed high pressure vapor from the vapor generator into the condensate receiver for imposing a pressure head upon the condensate therein to be approximately the same as that in the generator, and thus the pressure difference between the suction side and the discharge side of the pump is drastically reduced while pumping the condensate into the generator, with the result that the energy consumption of the pump is also drastically reduced. The receiver is full of high pressure vapor while the condensate therein is drained by the pump, and the high pressure vapor means energy. Further new methods are involved to reduce the vapor pressure in the receiver by returning the vapor to the system or to utilize it, as disclosed in the application. Generally speaking, at least two closed receivers operated in series are required for the method of restoring the vapor in the receivers to the generator after the condensate is pumped into the generator. The invented receivers are also designed for condensate healing with almost no energy consumption.",CHEN THOMAS Y C,CHEN THOMAS Y C,,https://lens.org/083-632-333-925-367,Granted Patent,no,0,0,7,9,0,F22D11/06;;F22D11/06;;F22D11/00;;F22D11/00,F22B35/00;;F22D5/30;;F22D5/34;;F22D11/00;;F22D11/06,122-23,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A client application used to access a calendar system can also include integrated user interface controls for scheduling rides from a transportation service. When a ride is confirmed, the application can also request (e.g., key card) access to a building at the ride's destination. Integrating transportation services and facility access services though a calendar system reduces context switching between different applications. Reduced context switching streamlines scheduling of transportation for events (e.g., corporate meetings), which may result in individuals requesting transportation to an event along with (or at least closer in time to) the scheduling the event.

    A method of estimating pilot signal phase embedded in a wideband digital signal modulating a RF signal that is down converted to an intermediate frequency and digitized includes the steps of summing a block of the signal samples for removing the modulation data and generating data values representative of vector locations of the pilot signal with each data value representing an angular rotation of the pilot signal vector, and calculating the phase of the pilot signal by determining the arc tangent of the data values. The method produces a computationally efficient narrow band filter generated at the pilot signal frequency by simple addition of the digital data values. The method is usable in a software based 8-VSB digital television demodulation system.

A high-pass filtering process and a low-pass filtering process are performed to the input image pixel to obtain border and plain components which are multiplied by the first gain and second gain, respectively. The gained border component and plain component are summed and added to the original pixel to obtain a new pixel.

    A method of estimating symbol timing phase and rate offsets of a sampled digitally modulated signal having repetitive symbol sync sequences includes the steps of estimating symbol sync sequence locations in a block of signal samples using a cross-correlation with a reference pattern of ideal symbol sync sequences. Signal samples within subranges defining the symbol sync sequences in the block of signal samples are filtered for removing intersymbol interference. An iterative process of cross-correlation of the filtered signal samples within the subranges using the reference pattern of ideal symbol sync sequences and an ideal symbol sync correction pattern generates timing phase and rate offset values that are used to derive filter coefficients for resampling the filtered signal samples within the subranges using an interpolating filter. The rate offset value is derived using a linear model and performing an optimal estimation. The iterative cross-correlation and resampling process continues until the rate of change of timing phase and rate offset values are minimized. The timing phase and rate offset values are provided to a resampling FIR filter for generating properly synchronized signal samples that are time aligned to symbol-spaced boundaries.

The front side of the first sheet is toward opposite directions when it passes through the first passageway at the first and second times. When the first sheet is fed to the third passageway, a second sheet is fed to the first passageway.

    Nuclear magnetic resonance measurement of a medium are made using a tool with a static magnetic field having a gradient. The nuclear spins of the medium are magnetically polarized using the static magnetic field. Data are acquired from at least three sensitive volumes of the medium using an interleaved sequence of pulses at three different non-overlapping frequencies. At each frequency, a number of sub-sequences of a saturation pulse, a recovery pulse and at least one refocusing pulse are used. The saturation times between the saturation pulse and the recovery pulse for the sub-sequences are selected from a distribution of values between a minimum time to a maximum time to enable determination of T ₁ and T ₂ spectra over a wide range of values. Repetitions of sub-sequences having the same saturation at one or more frequencies may be carried out with phase alternation of the recovery pulse phases.

    A bond coating is applied between a ceramic matrix composite and a insulative and abradable top coat layer. The bond coating is a slurry layer of fine particles of silicon nitride and silicon carbide suspended in a colloidal silica or zircon binder. The ratio of these materials in the bond coating should match the ratio of these in the CMC. If the CMC is SiC fibers in a SiC matrix, the slurry should be composed of SiC particles with a colloidal silica binder. High surface roughness is achieved by entrapping coarse ceramic particles into the wet bond coating slurry. Thereafter the product is heat treated to maximize bond strength and verify oxidation resistance.

    Nuclear magnetic resonance measurement of a medium are made using a tool with a static magnetic field having a gradient. The nuclear spins of the medium are magnetically polarized using the static magnetic field. Data are acquired from at least three sensitive volumes of the medium using an interleaved sequence of pulses at three different non-overlapping frequencies. At each frequency, a number of sub-sequences of a saturation pulse, a recovery pulse and at least one refocusing pulse are used. The saturation times between the saturation pulse and the recovery pulse for the sub-sequences are selected from a distribution of values between a minimum time to a maximum time to enable determination of T ₁ and T ₂ spectra over a wide range of values. Repetitions of sub-sequences having the same saturation at one or more frequencies may be carried out with phase alternation of the recovery pulse phases.
