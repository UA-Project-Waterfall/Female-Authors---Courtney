A field emission display (FED) includes emitter sites formed on a baseplate; a grid for controlling electron emission from the emitter sites; a display screen for collecting electrons to form an image and a power supply. In order to reduce emission to grid during turn on, the display screen is enabled by the power supply prior to enabling of the emitter sites. An anode-baseplate voltage differential is thus established prior to electron emission. For turn on, the method includes varying the capacitances of the control circuits for the display screen and grid such that a time constant (RC) for the grid is larger than a time constant (RC) for the display screen. Alternately the method of the invention can be implemented during turn on using software, using time delay circuit components, or using an emitter site control circuit to control electron flow to the emitter sites. During turn off, the electron emission and anode-baseplate voltage differential are eliminated while a path to ground is provided for the grid.",MICRON DISPLAY TECH INC,CATHEY JR DAVID A;;LEWIS WILLIAM;;HUSH GLEN E;;HOWELL STEVEN,MICRON TECHNOLOGY INC (1997-09-17);;MICRON DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY INC (1995-08-02),https://lens.org/167-238-571-916-626,Granted Patent,yes,20,22,1,6,0,G09G3/22;;G09G3/22;;G09G2300/08;;G09G2300/08;;G09G2330/026;;G09G2330/026;;H01J3/022;;H01J3/022;;H01J2329/00;;H01J2329/00,G09G3/22;;H01J3/02,345/74;;313/495,3,1,075-710-415-872-191,10.1109/vtsa.1995.524648,"Harry Mileaf, Electronics One Seven, 1978, pp. 1 139 to 1 140.;;Notes on Using the Spindt type Field Emission Cathode, Capp Spindt, SRI Intrnational, Menlo Park, CA, Oct., 1976.;;Field Emission Displays , David A.
