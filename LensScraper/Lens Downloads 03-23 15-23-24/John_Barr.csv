The liquid to be measured is conducted through a pipe c<2> passing through the casing and drum, the end of the pipe being bent upwards so as to open above the mercury. When the forward end A<3> of a vane dips into the mercury, which acts as a valve, a closed space is formed into which the liquid passes and thereby raises the vane and causes the same to revolve.

Reducing-valves.-In a reducing-valve, the main valve C is operated by a piston D<1> the top of which is put alternately into communication with the inlet and discharge passages A<1>, A<2> by a valve H controlled by a spring- weighted diaphragm J' open to the fluid pressure on the discharge side only, through a passage L. In operation, pressure on the inlet side A<1> is communicated through the passages K<1>, K', the inlet port H<2> in the valve H, and the hollow screws K<3> to the piston chamber D, so that the valve C is kept closed on its seating B<1> when the pressure in the outlet passage A<2> is unduly high. If this pressure falls unduly, it ceases to hold up the diaphragm, which is then forced down by the spring J<5>, thereby opening the valve H.

Dec. 3, 1959 [Dec. 4, 1958; May 12, 1959], Nos. 39198/58 and 16236/59. Heading FIT. A turbine comprises a casing and a hollow rotor disposed therein, fluid under pressure being supplied to the space within the rotor and discharging thereform through nozzles formed in the rotor, the nozzles being so shaped that the rotor is caused to rotate by the reaction of the issuing fluid jets. The supply of pressure fluid to the rotor nozzles is controlled by a device which is urged towards its cut-off position in response to the speed of rotation of the rotor, the control device being loaded in the opening direction by pressure derived from the working fluid. The turbine may be operated by a gas, for example air, or by a liquid, for example oil, and is particularly suitable for portable use for example for driving portable tools. The turbine shown in Figs. 1 and 2 comprises a hollow rotor formed by a cup-shaped member 1 and a cover plate 2, fluid discharge nozzles 3 being formed in the side wall of the cup member 1. The rotor is mounted on a shaft 4 having a blind bore 7 to which fluid under pressure is supplied, the fluid passing into the hollow rotor through radial bores 10 in the shaft. The rotor shaft is rotatably supported within a casing 6 by means of bearings 5, one on either side of the rotor. A driving shaft 12 is also rotatably mounted in the casing in a bearing 11 and is connected to the rotor shaft by a universal joint 13. The supply of fluid into the rotor is controlled by means of a sleeve valve 26 co-operating with the bores 10, the sleeve 26 being moved towards the closing position by means of the centrifugal governor device 14, the centrifugal force being opposed by the pressure of the working fluid acting on the face 28. The sleeve 26 is provided with an annular recess 27 to which fluid flows from the openings 10, the pressure of the fluid then acting on the face 28 of the sleeve so as to oppose closing movement of the sleeve. The face 28 is shaped so that as the rim 32 approaches the face of the rotor, the fluid supply acting on the face 28 is restricted so that the centrifugal load on the sleeve can effect a positive closing action. The side wall of the rotor is also formed with hollow plug members 17 which have a weakened section at 18 so that in the event of excessive speed, the end portion of the plug becomes detached and fluid by-passes the reaction nozzles 3. The bores in which the plugs are mounted may be directed so that a retarding torque is produced. In Fig 3, a ball is disposed within a radial passage 20 in the rotor and acts as a valve to control flow of fluid from the openings 10 through the passage 21 to the nozzles 3. Centrifugal force tends to move the ball outwardly against the pressure of the fluid, the ball cutting off the supply of fluid at a predetermined speed of rotation. The passage 20 is vented to atmosphere through duct 25. Plug members 23 are utilized in the rotor shown in Fig. 4 in place of the ball 19 shown in Fig. 3, the plugs 23 controlling flow of fluid through passages 21 which lead to transverse passages 24 and thence to chambers which commiuncate with the reaction nozzles 3. The radial movement of the plugs 23 is limited so that the opening 21 is never completely closed, whereby pressure fluid always acts on the plug so as to oppose radially outward movement thereof due to centrifugal force.",TURBOMACHINES LTD,BARR JOHN CHARLES,,https://lens.org/157-425-449-031-358,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,F01B25/00,F01B25/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In Figs. 1a, 1b, 1c, the rotor 10 is formed with slots 17 having undercut recesses 16. The slot is formed by milling out an arcuate groove of radius 19 from the centre 20. The slot is formed with a taper increasing radius, the blade root being correspondingly shaped so that the blade becomes tightly locked during operation by means of centrifugal force. In a second embodiment, each blade root is formed with a projection at its radially inner end, the projection engaging a corresponding slot in the rotor hub to 'constitute a locking means against outward displacement. In a third embodiment, the invention is shown applied in the case of a rotor with skewed blades the arc upon which any blade root portion and the corresponding slot in the rotor hub are formed lying in a plane intersecting an axial plane of the rotor hub. In Fig. 4, blades 38 are attached to a single-sided rotor hub 37 and are locked against movement in both directions by flanges on the disc 44 and by a disc 43. Coolant fluid is supplied through a bore 45 in the shaft 33 and passes to the interior of the blades through passages 46, the fluid escaping through apertures 47 at the radially outer ends of the blades.

POWER JETS (RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT), Ltd. Aug. 29, 1952 [Sept. 28, 1951], No. 22753/51. Class 110(3) A combined heat and power supply system comprising an air compressor which discharges through a heater to a gas turbine delivering useful power and a steam raising boiler having a combustion chamber to which combustion supporting gas is supplied from the turbine exhaust, the exhaust gases of the boiler being used to supply at least in part the heat required at normal load in the heater, has a by-pass around the turbine and a further combustion chamber supplying additional heat to the heater fed with combustion supporting gas by the turbine arranged so that the steam and power requirements may be varied independently. Air supplied by a compressor 2 is heated in a heater 3 and then expanded in a turbine 4 driving the compressor. The exhaust from the turbine 4 is passed to a boiler 6 where it is used to support'the combustion of fuel fed through the pipe 7. The exhaust gases from the boiler pass through the heater 3 and the feed water heater 8 to atmosphere. Water is supplied to the boiler 6 from a pipe 10 and the resulting steam is used in a turbine 11 which assists the turbine 4 to drive the compressor 1 and generator 14. The exhaust steam is used in a process shown at 12 from which wet steam or water is recovered and returned via a condenser, where necessary, to the feed water heater 8. Make up feed water is supplied by a compressor driven evaporating still comprising a compressor 15, an evaporating chamber 16 and a heating coil 17. The compressor 15 maintains a low pressure in the chamber 16 and if this chamber is first heated, vapour is formed which is drawn off by the compressor. This vapour is further heated and compressed by the compressor 15 and discharged through the coil 17. The work put in by the compressor 15 maintains the operation of the system. The condensate may be led away or passed into the feed pipe 10. If the demand for steam falls when the demand for electricity is maintained, the fuel supply to the burners 7 is reduced and at the same time a combustion chamber in either of the positions 19, 20 is started up. If the demand for power falls, the turbine 4 may be bypassed by opening the valve 22. In a modification, a combustion chamber 24 which may be put into or taken out of operation is placed between the heater 3 and turbine 4. In another modification, the compressor is arranged in two stages with an intercooler between them and the compressor driving turbine is arranged in two stages with a reheater between them. The steam from the boiler may not necessarily be used in a turbine.",POWER JETS RES & DEV LTD,BARR JOHN CHARLES,,https://lens.org/124-232-571-452-158,Granted Patent,no,0,3,3,3,0,F01K17/04;;F01K23/06;;Y02E20/14;;Y02P80/15,F01K17/04;;F01K23/06,F1G G7A           G7B;;F1G G9            GZ;;F1Q Q8A1B         Q8A;;F1Q Q8A3          Q8A;;F1Q Q8A6A         Q8A,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

RANK ORGANISATION Ltd. 20 Dec., 1966 [8 Nov., 1965], No. 47341/65. Heading H4F. In a television system in which the output of a camera is applied to a cathode-ray tube picture reproducer, such as a monitor or viewfinder, means are provided to modulate the intensity of the electron beam as it scans at least one line of the raster so as to produce a visual indication at a distance from the beginning of the line which is representative of a quantity to be indicated, such as the zoom or focus settings of the camera lens. In Fig. 1 the quantity to be indicated is represented by a potential from potentiometer 30 which is compared in circuit 30 with line-frequency sawtooth signals K from generator 38 and results in pulses E of duration determined by the potential. The pulses are applied to a gate 37 which is opened for a small number of lines (two as illustrated) in a period immediately following field flyback whereby the transmitted pulses B, which are used as bright-up pulses for the picture reproducer, result in the production of a bright line which is located above the top of the picture area. The line has a length determined by the magnitude of the quantity to be indicated whereby the position of the brightness transition represents the quantity. A signal to control gate 37 is produced in response to each field synchronizing pulse F which triggers a bi-stable circuit 31 to open a gate 32 and allows line synchronizing pulses L to pass to a counter 33. The count N is chosen so as not to be completed until after completion of field flyback. The output from the counter resets bi-stable circuit 35 and triggers a second bistable circuit 34. This controls a gate 36 through which the line synchronizing pulses pass to a second counter 35 having a count M corresponding to the number of lines in which the quantity to be indicated is to be displayed. At the completion of the count bi-stable circuit 34 is reset. The output D from circuit 34 comprises the control signal for gate 37. The total N + M is selected to be less than the number of lines during field suppression so that the displayed quantity is located outside the picture display area. A second quantity is displayed by providing a further combination of bi-stable, counter and comparison circuits. A differentiation circuit may modify waveform B to provide a moving spot indication instead of a variable-length line. Where two indications are provided one may be a line and the other a spot to prevent confusion. In a modified arrangement, Figs. 3 and 4 (not shown), sawtooth generator 38 is triggered by the line synchronizing pulses at the output of gate 36 and gate 37 is dispensed with. Reference is made to an arrangement in which the indication is produced below the picture area.",RANK ORGANISATION LTD,BARR JOHN DENZIL,,https://lens.org/004-088-618-870-687,Granted Patent,no,0,0,4,4,0,H04N5/445;;H04N23/63;;H04N5/445,H04N5/232;;H04N5/445,H4F FBC           BC;;H4F FD2B          44;;H4F FD26M         44;;H4F FD26X         44;;H4F FD27A2        44;;H4F FD27T2        44;;H4F FD88          44,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

SPERRY GYROSCOPE CO., Ltd. Oct. 9, 1953 [Oct. 24, 1952], No. 26743/52. Class 40(1) [Also in Group XXXV] In an amplifier system, e.g. for a servo - system, in which an A.C. feedback signal comprising a predetermined time function of the amplifier output is derived by resistive and inductive elements from the amplifier D.C. output, if the output is A.C., from a D.C. derived from this A.C. output, this D.C. is fed to a magnetic modulator to produce a modulated A.C. feedback signal with a carrier frequency equal to that of the amplifier input and having a magnitude and phase sense corresponding to the magnitude and polarity of the D.C. signal. Both resistive and inductive elements are windings on the modulator, and the time function preferably includes the first integral and differential of the amplifier output First embodiment, Fig. 1. As shown, the usual A.C. error signal is applied to the input 11-12 of an amplifier A, the D.C. output of which, corresponding in magnitude and polarity to the magnitude and phase sense of the error signal, is fed to the servomotor M in series with the control windings 1, 1<SP>1</SP> of a magnetic modulator 15. The windings 1-1<SP>1</SP> mounted on the outer limbs 17, 18 of the core 16 produce opposing fluxes # 1 , #<SP>1</SP> 1 , in the centre limb 19. Series connected excitation and slug windings 2-2<SP>1</SP> on the outer limbs are energized over a transformer 3 at the carrier frequency to produce opposed fluxes # 2 , # 2 <SP>1</SP>, in the centre limb 19, the slug action causing the fluxes in the outer limbs to vary according to the integral of the D.C. control current. The modulator output coil 4 carries a D.C. bias derived from a high impedance source over a resistor 5 which biases the outer limbs to non-linear parts of their magnetization curves. The difference in the A.C. fluxes in the outer limbs is arranged to be proportional to the difference in their permeabilities and is equal to the A.C. flux in the centre limb which induces an A.C. signal in the output winding 4 of carrier frequency modulated according to the integral of the D.C. control current. The out-' put winding 4 also functions as the secondary of the transformer injecting the error signal into the amplifier A, the primary 6 in this case also being provided on the centre limb of the core 16. Second embodiment; Fig. 2. To add an integral component of the error signal to the motor control circuit, the inverse, i.e. the first derivative component, is added to the negative feed back circuit by using a transformer in lieu of a differentiating network and combining it with the magnetic modulator. A coil 26 on an E-shaped core 21 is excited from a low impedance source at carrier frequency, and a slug winding 27 is wound round the three cores 21-22-23 such that equal magnetizing forces at carrier frequency are exerted on the cores 22-23 which are biased by the output and D.C. bias windings 24, 25, to non-linear parts of their magnetization curves. The windings are energized so that when the carrier frequency flux assists the biasing flux in one core 22-23 the corresponding fluxes are opposed in the other core. The core material and bias flux are chosen so that the resultant output voltage produced by the series differentially connected coils 24-25 is proportional to the current in the slug winding. The amplifier output is series connected with the motor M and a control winding 28 the current in which determines slug winding current and therefore the carrier frequency output of windings 24-25. The transfer function relating carrier output to D.C. control current is, as shown in the. Specification, such that the output contains both integral and differential components of the error signal. As in the Fig. 1 embodiment, the device may be used as the input transformer for applying the error signal to the amplifier by providing primary windings 29-30 on the cores 22-23.",SPERRY GYROSCOPE CO LTD,BARR JOHN DENZIL,,https://lens.org/100-851-866-910-568,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G05F1/325,G05F1/325,G1N NAHH          AHHB;;G1N NAHHB         AHHB;;G1N N1E           AHHB;;G1N N3S1C         AHHB;;G1N N3S14         AHHB,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Lens mounts; automatic speed control. RANK ORGANISATION Ltd. Oct. 17, 1966 [Oct.15, 1965], No.43872/65. Headings G2J and G3R. [Also in Division H2] In focusing a television or other camera in which a driven element F2, Fig. 1, which moves the relevant lenses is controlled by a normally hand operated primary demand element A, in order to facilitate a rapid refocusing when the object distance is suddenly changed, an auxiliary demand element is provided which has been preset corresponding to the required new object distance and an electrical switch or mechanical device allows a changeover of control from the primary to the auxiliary demand element. As shown. Fig. 5, the primary demand element controls a tachogenerator B whose output is fed to a servo-device comprising a reversible electric motor G and tachogenerator G1 whose shafts G2, G3, are coupled together and drive through reduction gearing G4, the driven element F2. If the objective is of the zoom type, a potentiometer N is included whose tapping N1 is controlled by the zoom control member, as in Specification No. 1, 080, 011 so that the effective transmission ratio between the movements of the primary demand and driven elements depends on the position of the zoom control member. To effect rapid refocusing, a push button switch K is depressed and this places the electric motor G, under the control of the outputs of two equal potentiometers L, L1, energized from a D.C. source and connected in opposite senses, the tapping of potentiometer L being dependant on the position of a hand knob L4 forming the auxiliary demand element which has been previously preset, and the tapping of potentiometer L1 being dependant on the position of driven element F2, so that directly the driven element F2 reaches the new desired position, the outputs of potentiometers L, L1 cancel out and motor G stops. To prevent overshooting, a small damping voltage is applied through a high resistance J2 from the tachogenerator G1. In a modification, Fig. 3 (not shown), a plurality of auxiliary control circuits are provided, each with their own push button. To prevent the driven element F2 from moving at high speed against an end stop, a device may be incorporated as in Specification No. 1,080, 591 in which potentiometer 0 has its tapping 01 controlled by the position of the element F2 so that as the latter approaches either limiting position its speed is reduced. In a further form the speed of the reversible motor is determined, when the primary control device is in operation by the frequency of pulses generated by a pulse generator in accordance at least in part, with the speed of operation of the primary demand element. In a modification, Fig.6 (not shown), a handwheel (30) drives a shaft (32) connected to the lens focusing mechanism. When the handwheel (30) is released and a lever (40) moved so that a cam follower (38) thereon engages a heart-shaped cam (36), the shaft (32) and thus the lens focusing mechanism is moved to a position determined by the cam follower (38) reaching the re-entrant portion of the cam (36). The desired cam position is set initially either by a scale or by holding it in position by lever (40) whilst focusing by handwheel (30), a slipping clutch correction 34 between the cam (36) and shaft (32) allowing this. In further forms, stops are used instead of cams and two or more pre-set devices may be employed.",RANK ORGANISATION LTD,BARR JOHN DENZIL,,https://lens.org/175-902-226-879-548,Granted Patent,no,0,3,4,4,0,G03B17/14;;G03B17/14;;G02B27/40;;G02B27/40;;G03B3/02;;G03B3/02;;G03B13/20;;G03B13/20;;G03B19/18;;G03B19/18,G02B27/40;;G03B3/02;;G03B13/20;;G03B17/14;;G03B19/18,G2J J23C          J23;;G3N NDX           DX;;G3N NGE3AA        GE3AA;;G3N N275          DX;;G3N N275          GE3AA;;G3R R110C         R33D;;G3R R112A         -;;G3R R112C         -;;G3R R33D2R        R33D;;G3R R4            -;;H2J J2C           -;;H2J J2GX          -;;H2J J2JX          J2G3;;H2J J5            -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The electromagnet A is intermittently excited when the gas holder is rising and attracting its armature A', which is carried by a lever A<2> and is normally held by a counterweight A against an adjustable rubber-padded stop, rocks the spindle D. The lever A<3> carried by the spindle is thus caused to bring its driving-pawl F into contact with the wheel H, and turn the spindle N to the left. When the gas holder falls, the magnet B is intermittently excited and acts in a similar manner through corresponding mechanism B', B<2>, B<4>, E, B<3>, and G to turn the wheel J, and so the spindle N to the right. The spindle is geared to a pointer on a dial, and the recording-mechanism is actuated as described in the prior Specification or otherwise. The teeth of the wheels H, J are of the peculiar shape shown in Fig. 5, and point in opposite directions. The pawls F and G are counterweighted at R to hold them in proper position for action against a stop Q, and the acting surface is a friction roller S.

Bucket pumps; barrels and cylinders; valves.- Relates to pumps intended, more especially, for mines, deep wells, &c., and consists of means whereby the valves and their casing, alone or together with the barrel, may be drawn up through the rising main, for repair &c. For this purpose the barrel is of smaller diameter than the rising main, and is supported therein by means of a shoulder at its lower end, or, as shown in Figs. 4 and 5, by a flange at its upper end. A number of different methods of raising the barrel are described. In one, a projection on the lower end of the pump rod engages with a socket in the bottom of the barrel after the manner of a bayonet joint, or with a bridge-piece in the barrel ; or the bucket may engage a projecting ring at the top of the barrel ; or means separate from the bucket may be used. Figs. 4 and 5 show two embodiments of the invention. In one, Fig. 4, the bucket consists of a hollow piston H with an upper and a lower trunk H<1>, H<2>. At top and bottom of the barrel are valves K, K<1>, and in the trunks H<1>, H<2> are valves J<3>, J<4>, and outlets J' in the trunk H<1>. The barrel is raised by the engagement of the piston H with the ring L. In Fig. 5, the barrel is divided by a diaphragm L<3> into two parts, the two corresponding pistons being carried by a common rod. Round the barrel is an annular space opening into the rising main and communicating with the barrel by non-return valves N<3>, N<4>, N<5> ; N, N<1>, N<2> are the auction valves. The barrel is raised by the engagement of the sleeve P with the ring A<3>. In a modification, a bucket carrying both suction and delivery valves, as described in Specification No. 3248, A.D. 1898, is used. Another modification is adapted for use with oppositely-reciprocating buckets, as described in Specification No. 17,518, A.D. 1900. In another modification, a bucket of ordinary construction is used with a barrel having a downward extension in which are fitted suction valves.",ASHLEY HERBERT;;BARR JOHN,ASHLEY HERBERT;;BARR JOHN,,https://lens.org/199-186-595-500-253,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Bucket pumps; plunger pumps; pump counterbalances; delivery column, balancing.-Consistsof a construction in which the pump is double-acting with a single bucket, and balanced at all levels of the water in the well or hole. Fig. 1 shows the application to a pump having a bucket D in which the suction valves E are carried on a portion D<1> of the bucket of reduced diameter, G<1>, G<2> being the delivery valves. The bucket-rod H is hollow and open at the top, and at its lower end communicates by a passage H<1> with the annular space between the barrel A and the reduced part D<1> of the bucket. The water thus stands in the rod H at the same level as in the well and rising main C. The rod H occupies about half the area of the rising main C, and acts as a plunger, so that the pump delivers on the down-stroke as well as on the upstroke. In a modification, a double cup K, Fig. 2, containing a ball valve K', is fitted above the passage H<1>, so that, should the water level in the well be below the bucket D, the valve K<2> will prevent air from being drawn through the rod H. Two adaptations of the invention to a bucket of ordinary construction are described. In one, the communication between the hollow rod H and the space below the bucket, by way of a passage similar to H', is controlled by ports in an extension of the delivery valve, so arranged that the passage H<1> is only open when the delivery valve is closed. In the second case, the bolt connecting the rod H and bucket is hollow, and slides over a central tube, the open lower end of which is always below the level of the water in the well.",ASHLEY HERBERT;;BARR JOHN,ASHLEY HERBERT;;BARR JOHN,,https://lens.org/105-123-197-401-681,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Barr, J., and Wilkinson, J. P. May 25. Sewage, treating; bacteriological processes; filtering; tanks.-Relates to apparatus for periodically and automatically supplying and discharging chambers or receptacles, particularly applicable to bacteria beds, filters, or tanks for sewage, as well as for supplying and discharging cisterns used for flushing trough-closets, drains, and the like. When applied to bacteria beds and the like which are connected with a main channel A, each bed has a small chamber A' containing a supply valve B in the form of a tank, which is preferably counterweighted and provided with guides B<5>. In the bottom of the valve B is an auxiliary valve C, which is connected by a cord C<1> and pulleys C<2>, C<3> with the armature of an electromagnet C<3> connected with a central station. When the electric circuit is completed, the electromagnet opens the valve C, and the valve B empties through it and floats off its seat so as to admit the liquid to the passage A<5> which leads to the bacteria bed, filter, tank, or other receptacle H. The armature is maintained in its lower position by a catch and the valve C is thus kept open until the receptacle is filled. When the receptacle is full, the catch holding the armature is liberated by mechanism operated by a rod F<4> rising from a float in a small chamber F<2>. The valve C thereupon closes, and the valve B fills through a small hole B<3>, and settles upon its seat, thereby cutting off the supply of liquid to the receptacle. A pipe J connecting the receptacle H with a chamber L is fitted with a cock K so that the time necessary to fill this chamber may be regulated. When the chamber is filled, an automatic siphon M admits a rush of liquid by the pipe N into a balance tank 0 suspended from a lever E<4> which carries a valve E<5>. This valve is thereby opened, and the liquid in the receptacle H is admitted to the discharge passages R, R. The valve E<5> is maintained in its raised position by a pin E<3> on the lever E<4> engaging a catch E<2> on a lever E'. When the electromagnet is again put in circuit for refilling the receptacle, the lever E<1> is depressed by a lever D<1> connected with the armature, the pin E<3> is thereupon liberated from the catch E<2>, and the valve E<5> drops on to its seat, the water in the balance tank O having previously run out through a small hole S. Instead of completing the electric circuit from a central station, the circuits may be arranged so that on the descent of the valve B, a rod connected therewith operates a lever which makes a contact for the electromagnet actuating the valves for filling the next bed of the series. The electromagnets and armatures may be replaced by cords or wires, which run from the central station, or connect the valves of one receptacle with those of the next.",BARR JOHN;;WILKINSON JAMES PICKLES,BARR JOHN;;WILKINSON JAMES PICKLES,,https://lens.org/065-233-425-142-959,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Alternatively, the average equivalent cone angle, measured o v e r the whole length of the diffuser passage, is of not greater divergence than 12 degrees in the median direction of flow. The walls 17 of the diffuser 15 may be frustoconical or, as shown, may be curved. The curvature may be such as to maintain the equivalent cone angle at a value which is substantially constant throughout the length of the diffuser passage. Vanes 16 may be provided beyond the diffuser. In the case of frusto-conical walls, the average equivalent cone angle may be maintained at a predetermined value over a finite length, with a slightly different value over a. succeeding finite length.

RANK ORGANISATION Ltd. 27 Nov., 1968 [14 Dec., 1967], No. 56897/67. Heading H4D. [Also in Division G2] Specification describes an automatic focusing system for a television camera 1, Fig. 1, comprising a focus modulator 8 for cyclically modulating the focus setting of the camera, a highpass filter 10 for filtering the video output signal of the camera, phase sensitive detector means 12 synchronized to the focus modulation frequency and responsive to the filter output to provide a focus error signal indicative of the sense and magnitude of the departure of the focus setting from a sharp focus setting, and servo means 3, 4 effective to adjust the camera-focus setting in response to said focus error signal and in a sense to reduce the magnitude of said error signal. The focus modulator 8 comprises similar optical prisms 8a and 8b or ""male and female"" prisms 8c, and 8d, Fig. 2, vibrated in opposite directions perpendicular to the optical axis at half frame (or line) frequency. This will result in a variations of the optical path length giving alternate frames (or lines) of the television different degrees of focus and video signals having different high frequency contents. The scene viewed by the camera is displayed on monitor 7 and means 5, 6 and 9 are provided to select a part of said scene to be brought into focus and indicate said part on the monitor, as for example enclosed by a luminous rectangle. Gating signal generator 5 comprises means under the control of joy-stick 6 generating voltage S representative of the co-ordinates of the selected part and comparison means receiving and comparing said voltages and the corresponding scan signals and generating a gating signal when equality is detected. The gating signal is used to open gate 9 and pass the selected video signal to a high frequency filter 11. The output of the filter is detected at 11 to produce an alternating waveform at half frame (or line) frequency and having maximum and minimum valves representing by their absolute valves the degree of focussing in the alternate focus (or lines) and by their signs the respective direction of the out of focus. Said waveform is then synchronously demodulated in phase sensitive demodulator 12 and the output thereof used to readjust the focus by means of servo drive 4 and focusing means 3.",RANK ORGANISATION LTD,BARR JOHN DENZIL;;PLUMMER DEXTER ROBERT,,https://lens.org/083-127-947-567-077,Granted Patent,no,0,1,5,5,0,H04N23/673;;H04N23/673,H04N5/232,G2J JB7G          -;;G3R RA273         BC27;;G3R RA382         BC27;;G3R RA43          BC27;;G3R RBC27         BC27;;H4D DLAE          LAE;;H4D D244          L;;H4D D244          LAE;;H4D D259          L;;H4D D259          LAE;;H4D D27X          L;;H4D D27X          LAE;;H4D D711          L;;H4D D711          LAE;;H4D D771          L;;H4D D771          LAE;;H4D D782          L;;H4D D782          LAE,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Grip D rotates in bearing D 3 in bracket D 4 detachably fixed to the handle C through a short bracket E by means of a clamping chain E 2 . Ring G is spring-urged to a zero position and controls the setting of the tapping J 3 on a potentiometer J which provides a current whose magnitude and direction decides the direction and speed of an electric reversible motor K which moves elements B 2 of the zoom lens through ring B 4' The potentiometer output is fed to an amplifier L with the opposing voltage output of a tacho-generator K 1 mounted on a common shaft K 2 with motor K, and the amplified difference drives motor K, the system thereby constituting a speed-controlling servodevice which quickly brings the motor to rest when contact J 3 is returned to zero by ring G. The potentiometer may or may not be carried in the hand-grip. The spring return means for ring G comprises two springs acting in opposite directions keyed between a barrel H 4 and two sleeves, H 2 and H 3 respectively, which surround and are keyed to spindles H and H 1 , Stops limit the rotation of ring G which is keyed to spindle H 1 , while grip D is keyed to spindle H.",RANK PRECISION IND LTD,BARR JOHN DENZIL;;CLIFFORD RICHARD FRANK,,https://lens.org/057-806-445-670-674,Granted Patent,no,0,3,4,4,0,G03B17/14;;G05D3/1409;;G03B17/565;;G03B17/14;;G05D3/1409;;G03B17/565,G03B17/14;;G03B17/56;;G05D3/14;;H04N5/225,G2J J23C          J23;;H4F FD27A2        4-;;H4F FD27T2        4-;;H4F FD85          4-,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

RANK ORGANISATION Ltd. May 13, 1968 [May 18, 1967], No.23236/67. Heading G1N. [Also in Division G2] The three-dimensional movements of a television camera mounted on a stand are measured electrically and fed to actuators to control the camera to keep a fixed subject in focus during movement of the camera assembly. As shown Fig. 1, the camera 18 and lens unit 22 are mounted on a trolley 2 having three wheels 4 whose angular direction is determined by steering bar 12 coupled to the wheels via shaft 14, sprocket 10 and chain 6. The forward velocity V of the assembly is measured by a tachogenerator 30 coupled to a wheel 4; the angle # between the direction of motion of the trolley and the horizontal projection of the line of sight is measured by a potentiometer 34 mounted on shaft 14; the angle # between the line of sight and the horizontal is measured by a potentiometer 36. To compensate for panning movement of the assembly, a signal( V sin # / D(F) cos #) is derived, where D(F) is the distance between the camera and the subject, derived from a potentiometer 32 whose slider is coupled to the lens unit 22 and is thus dependent on the focus setting of the lens in accordance with the distance between the camera and the subject. This signal may be augmented at 51 Fig. 5 by an arbitrary pan demand signal from unit 50, and the combined signal fed to a pan servomotor 52. To compensate for tilting movement of the camera, a signal incorporating h, the rate of increase in height of the camera, is derived, h being measured by a tachogenerator 40 Fig. 2 (not shown) coupled between the trolley 2 and the camera 18. This signal may similarly be augmented by a tilt demand signal, and fed to the tilt servomotor 54. Similarly signals for correcting the focus or maintaining a constant zoom setting as a result of camera displacement are obtained by appropriate combinations of the signals from the above transducers Figs. 3, 4 (not shown).",RANK ORGANISATION LTD,PLUMMER DEXTER ROBERT;;BARR JOHN DENZIL,,https://lens.org/177-385-194-851-267,Granted Patent,no,0,5,8,8,0,G03B17/561;;H04N23/6815;;H04N23/68;;H04N23/6812;;G03B17/561;;H04N23/68;;H04N23/6812;;H04N23/6815,G03B17/56;;H04N5/232,G1N N1A3A         NA;;G1N N1A3B         NA;;G1N N1D7          NA;;G1N N1D8          NA;;G1N N3S1A         NA;;G1N N4A           NA;;G1N N7N           NA;;G1N N7T1A         NA;;G2J JRB           JRB;;G2J JRB1          JRB1;;G2J J26           -;;G3N NEX           EX;;G3N NE2A          BG;;G3N NGE1A         GE1A;;G3N N251          BG;;G3N N251          BH;;G3N N275          BG;;G3N N275          EX;;G3N N275          GE1A;;G3N N287          BH;;G3N N351          BG,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Postal letters and like flat articles are fed singly to a position in front of a sorter by a pair of oppositely rotatable single-turn helices 12 and a smaller pair of helices 17. The letters are fed to the helices by a horizontal belt conveyer 21, preferably comprising three narrow spaced belts, inclined similarly constructed belt conveyers 22, 23, 24 driven at progressively increasing speeds, a suction head 25, opposed pairs of endless tapes 27 and a plate 15. Rollers 20 in the same plane as the shafts of the helices 17 are driven continuously to urge the letters towards a central position. The height of the stack of letters on the conveyer 24 is maintained between upper and lower limits, between which limits the suction head 25 removes the top letter from the stack. The limits are maintained by a pivoted feeler 30 which is moved by a rotary cam 35. When the feeler is in the lowest position, it closes contacts 33 in the circuit of the motor 34 which drives the conveyers.

Automatic speed control; zoom lenses. RANK ORGANISATION Ltd. Oct. 12, 1966 [Sept.3, 1965], No.37663/65. Headings G2J and G3R. The zoom mechanism 10 of a television camera is driven by motor 18 associated with tachometer generator 17 and amplifier 19, the zoom rate being controlled by potentiometer 29 which is set manually. A focus portion 11, which allows the lens to be adjusted independently of the zoom setting, is actuated by mechanism 12 which is controlled by hand wheel 13 of demand unit 14. A tachometer generator 31 is driven by the mechanism 12 to provide an electrical signal which is added to the zoom rate signal from potentiometer 29, thus compensating for the effect of focus adjustment upon the magnification. The signal from the generator 31 may be attenuated by a potentiometer coupled to the zoom mechanism. If the zoom mechanism is controlled by a positional servo, the positional demand signal is modified by a signal from the focusing system. The positional servo comprises demand and reset potentiometers, and the modifying signal is derived from a further potentiometer. Both rate and positional servo operation may be combined in one zoom lens arrangement, with a switch for selecting either of the two modes of operation, Fig. 6 (not shown). The tachometer generator 31 may have one of its terminals earthed, the other terminal feeding a signal in parallel with the zoom demand signal by way of a fixed resistor, or a rheostat which is driven by the zoom mechanism. The focus rate signal may be obtained by differentiating the output of a potentiometer driven by the mechanism 12. A hand-driven tachometer generator may be used as the demand unit for the focus servo, a modified signal from this generator being injected into the zoom rate control system. This modification can be effected by a fixed resistor, or a rheostat having its wiper driven from the zoom mechanism. In other arrangements for positional control of zoom, in which compensation is afforded by modifying the zoom error signal by a further signal obtained from the focus mechanism, the reset resistor of the zoom position servo is divided and the focus position signal is fed into the zoom reset path. Two rheostats may be placed in series with the reset potentiometer on the zoom system, both rheostats being driven from the focus mechanism. A potentiometer may be connected across the reset resistor of the zoom positional servo, the potentiometer being driven from the focus mechanism with its wiper connected to both of its end terminals through diodes and resistors.",RANK ORGANISATION LTD,BARR JOHN DENZIL;;PLUMMER DEXTER ROBERT,,https://lens.org/017-746-507-758-848,Granted Patent,no,0,5,4,4,0,G03B3/02;;G05D3/1445;;G05D3/1472;;H04N23/67;;G05D3/1472;;G03B3/02;;G05D3/1445;;H04N23/67,G03B3/02;;G05D3/14;;H04N5/232,G2J J23C          J23;;G3N NE2B          E2B;;G3N NGE2          GE2;;G3N N275          E2B;;G3N N275          GE2;;G3R R110C         RZ/3;;G3R R31X          -;;G3R R33D2R        RZ/3;;G3R R4            -;;G3R R68           -;;G3R R8W           -;;G3R R9B           -;;G3R R9H           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Lens mounts; automatic speed control. RANK PRECISION INDUSTRIES Ltd., [trading as THE RANK ORGANISATION RANK TAYLOR HOBSON DIVISION]. Jan. 15, 1964 [Jan. 18, 1963], No.2281/63. Headings G2J and G3R. [Also in Division H2] In a zoom type objective the depth of focus varies appreciably with variation of focal length and accordingly the zoom control element is arranged to vary the effective transmission ratio, either continuously or in steps, between the focusing control element and the part of the objective controlled thereby to facilitate focusing. As shown applied to a television or other camera D, Fig. 1 the part F2 of the objective is moved for focusing by rotating a front part F1 by gearing H which is connected by a variable transmission to a hand wheel A. In the arrangement of Fig. 2, rotation of the hand wheel A causes rotation of a tacho-generator B, through gearing A1, the electrical output being amplified at J and fed to a reversible electric motor G whose output shaft G3 drives the gearing H and also the input shaft G2 of a second tacho-generator G1 whose output is fed through a potentiometer K as an opposition voltage to that from the first tacho-generator B. The front part F2 thus moves at a speed proportional to the speed of hand wheel A, the proportionality varying according to the position of potentiometer K which is controlled by the zoom control element through gearing L, L1. Alternatively the potentiometer (K) may be used as a potential divider acting to vary the attenuation in inverse proportions of the output voltages of tacho-generators (B) and (G1 Fig. 3 (not shown). The potentiometer may form part of a push-pull circuit in the amplifier J or be replaced by a variable reactance device in an alternating-current system. In another form, Fig. 5 (not shown) the reversible direct-current electric motor (G) is connected in one arm of a bridge circuit and arranged so that the feedback to the amplifier (J1) represents the back E.M.F. of the motor (G) and thus its speed, the potentiometer being incorporated as a two part potential divider (K1) (K2) between the outputs of the tacho-generator (B) and the feedback voltage of the bridge circuit. In another arrangement the output voltages from the first tacho-generator and from the feedback device may be separately amplified and used to provide two separate controlling currents for the motor, which may be of constant armature current type, having two control field windings. In a further embodiment, Fig. 6 (not shown) the hand wheel A is replaced by a lever (N) which controls a potentiometer (P) and is spring urged at (N1) to a central position in which the output of the potentiometer (P) is zero. On moving the lever to either side of zero, the motor (G) Fig. 7 (not shown), is rotated at a speed proportional to the movement of the lever and in a direction corresponding to the sense of movement of the lever. On returning the lever to the central zero position, the motor (G) stops substantially immediately. The potentiometer (K), under the control of the zoom control element, may be arranged in various ways as in the embodiments wherein a hand wheel A was used. In further embodiments the transmission ratio may be altered by a variable speed gear, Fig. 9 (not shown). The hand wheel (A) drives the cone (R1) which, through intermediate part (R) drives cone (R2) coupled through gearing (H1), (H), to the part (F2) of the objective which is movable for focussing, the position of part (R) being controlled by the zoom control element (L2). In another arrangement hydraulic transmission is used, the sensitivity being controlled by a swash plate the angle of which is varied by the zoom control element. Alternatively a pump (S), Fig. 10 (not shown) under the control of a focusing control element operates the pistons (S3) of a number of cylinders (S2) in parallel, the pistons (S3) being linked together to a member (H2) driving the focusing part (F2) of the objective. The zoom control element drives through gearing (L3), a cam (T1) which operates valves (T) in succession to cutout the effect of cylinders (S2) one after another so that the transmission ratio is varied in steps.",RANK PRECISION IND LTD,BARR JOHN DENZIL;;PLUMMER DEXTER ROBERT,,https://lens.org/177-723-304-979-341,Granted Patent,no,0,2,6,6,0,G02B7/08;;G02B7/10;;G02B27/40;;G03B17/14;;G05D3/14;;G05D3/1409;;G05D3/1409;;G03B17/14;;G02B27/40;;G02B7/10;;G05D3/14;;G02B7/08,G02B7/08;;G02B7/10;;G02B15/14;;G02B27/40;;G03B17/14;;G05D3/14,G2J J23C          J23;;G3N NDA           DA;;G3N NDB           F2;;G3N NE2X          E2X;;G3N NGDA          GDA;;G3N NGE2          GE2;;G3N N251          BH;;G3N N251          F2;;G3N N275          BH;;G3N N275          E2X;;G3N N275          F2;;G3N N275          GDA;;G3N N275          GE2;;G3N N351          F2;;G3R R110C         R33D;;G3R R112A         -;;G3R R112C         -;;G3R R33D2Q        R33D;;G3R R33D2R        R33D;;G3R R4            -;;G3R R68           -;;H2J J1B           -;;H2J J1D2          -;;H2J J1H2C         -;;H2J J1U           -;;H2J J2B2A         -;;H2J J2C           -;;H2J J2F1          -;;H2J J2GX          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

This requires heating and cooling equipment that adds size, weight, cost and complexity to the laser design. For military lasers that must operate over a large temperature range but still must be carried by a soldier, the weight and cost issues are severe. The invention makes use of multiple wavelengths, Bragg grating reflectors, to force a diode laser to operate at discrete wavelengths matched to the desired absorption wavelengths of the solid state laser material. The multiple discrete wavelengths are chosen to span a range of temperatures larger than that which can be accommodated by a single wavelength grating. Thus, as the diode temperature varies, the pump wavelength will switch among preselected wavelengths to assure consistent and efficient pumping over a predetermined temperature range.",US DEPT OF THE ARMY,BARR DALLAS N;;NETTLETON JOHN E,ARMY UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AS REPRESENTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE (2005-07-14),https://lens.org/169-024-331-343-493,Patent Application,yes,2,4,1,1,0,H01S3/0602;;H01S3/09415;;H01S3/1611;;H01S3/1643;;H01S3/1653;;H01S5/1215;;H01S5/141;;H01S3/09415;;H01S3/1611;;H01S3/1643;;H01S3/1653;;H01S5/1215;;H01S3/0602;;H01S5/141,H01S3/091;;H01S3/08;;H01S3/092;;H01S3/094,372/75;;372/70;;372/102,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Lens focus control automatic speed control. RANK ORGANISATION Ltd. July 15, 1968 Aug.7, 1967], No.36122/67. Headings G2J and G3R. In a television or motion picture camera 7, Fig.1, the depth of field varies with aperture setting and accordingly a variable transmission is interposed between a focus demand 2 and a focus control 8, 10, 12, the variable transmission being coupled to the aperture setting, and in a zoom objective, also coupled to the focal length adjusting mechanism. As shown, a manually operated handwheel 2 is coupled through step-up gearing 3 to a tachogenerator 6 accommodated in housing 9 on the side of the camera 7. The output of tachogenerator 6 is fed into an electrical servo device 11 comprising a motor 8 whose output shaft is directly coupled to a second tachogenerator 14 and coupled through gearing 12 to the focus adjusting portion 10. The difference between the outputs of tachogenerators 6, 14 is fed to an amplifier (16), Fig. 2 (not shown) whose output controls motor 8, there being potentiometers 18, 20 controlled by gearing 22, 26 respectively coupled to the iris setting and focal length adjusting mechanisms, which may be arranged in circuit with tachogenerators 6, 14 and amplifier (16) in various arrangements Figs. 2-4 and 6 (not shown). Alternatively the iris and focal length settings may control the gain of amplifier Figs. 7 and 8, (not shown). In a mechanical embodiment, Fig. 5, rotation of focus demand handle 50 and thus of cylinder 52 causes rotation of wheel 54 and its attached cylinder 60 whose extent of longitudinal movement and thus of focus control 64, 66 depends on the skew angle of rollers 80 controlled by the setting of iris 70 and zoom element 68.",RANK ORGANISATION LTD,BARR JOHN DENZIL;;PLUMMER DEXTER ROBERT,,https://lens.org/072-274-518-456-839,Granted Patent,no,0,0,5,5,0,G02B7/08;;G03B17/14;;G03B17/42;;G05D3/14;;G05D3/1409;;G03B17/565;;G05D3/1409;;G02B7/08;;G03B17/14;;G03B17/42;;G05D3/14;;G03B17/565,G02B7/08;;G03B17/14;;G03B17/42;;G03B17/56;;G05D3/14,G2J J22           -;;G2J J23C          J23;;G3N NDA           DA;;G3N NGDA          GDA;;G3N N275          GDA;;G3R R110C         R33D;;G3R R112A         -;;G3R R33D2R        R33D;;G3R R4            -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Gas turbine plant; centrifugal compressors. POWER JETS (RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT), Ltd. Oct. 19, 1954 [Oct. 20, 1953], No. 28989/53. Classes 110 (1) and 110 (3). An air compressing plant comprises a first compressor, the air from which is heated and passed to a turbine driving the compressor, the exhaust of the turbine being led to a second turbine driving a second compressor arranged to accept air from the first compressor and deliver it to an outlet. In the arrangement shown, Fig. 1, an air compressor 10 discharges into a combustion chamber 13 feeding a turbine 11 which drives the compressor. The exhaust of the turbine 11 is supplied to a turbine 18 which drives a compressor 14 supplied with air from the compressor 10. The compressor 14 discharges through a receiver 15 to a duct 16 leading to the point of use. The compressor 14 may be driven by the high-pressure turbine and the compressor 10 by the low-pressure turbine. The receiver 15 has a by-pass duct 20 controlled by a relief valve 21 regulated by a flow detecting device 23. The flow detecting device and relief valve 21 may be as described in Specification 612,414. Temporary reduction of flow may be obtained by hand operation of the valve 24. A governor 25 controlling the fuel supply to the combustion chamber 13 prevents overspeeding. For idling conditions the fuel supply to the combustion chamber is controlled by a second manual control (not shown). The whole of the compressing plant may be mounted on the receiver 15 so that it may float in water. The receiver may also be formed by the space between an outer casing and the main components of the plant. The compressor 10, Fig. 2, discharges into the duct 27 feeding the combustion chamber 13 which discharges through a scroll 28 to the turbines 11, 18 arranged in series and driving the compressors 10, 14, respectively. Part of the air from the compressor 10 passes through the duct 30 to the compressor 14 which discharges into the receiver 15. The receiver 15, which is in the form of a flat hollow slab, supports the compressing plant by the members 31. The Provisional Specification describes an arrangement in which a single turbine drives both compressors. In another arrangement the air is taken off to the user from the gas turbine plant compressor without further compression. In a further arrangement the air for the combustion chamber is bled off from a stage of a compressor which discharges direct to a user. Arrangements in which the compressor supplying the user is independent of the gas turbine compressor are also described.

The bias unit comprises a number of hydraulic actuators spaced apart around the periphery of the unit, each having a movable thrust member which is displaceable outwardly for engagement with the formation. Each actuator can be connected, through a rotatable control valve, to a source of drilling fluid under pressure, the control valve comprising a first part, rotatable with the instrument carrier, which co-operates with a second part which is rotatable with the bias unit. Means are provided to roll stabilise the instrument carrier so that relative rotation between the bias unit and instrument carrier, as the bias unit rotates, causes the valve to operate the actuators in synchronism with rotation of the bias unit so as to apply a lateral bias thereto. In order to neutralise or reduce the net bias applied to the bias unit the instrument carrier may be rotated in various modes instead of being roll stabilised, e.g. it may be rotated at a constant slow speed relative to the bias unit, or at a significantly faster rate so that the actuators do not have time to operate fully. The angular velocity of the carrier may also be varied during its rotation, according to various formulae, in order to vary the net bias. The net bias may also be varied by alternating different modes of carrier rotation.",BARR JOHN D;;CLEGG JOHN M;;MOTION WILLIAM C,BARR JOHN D;;CLEGG JOHN M;;MOTION WILLIAM C,,https://lens.org/167-663-093-365-651,Patent Application,no,0,0,17,20,0,E21B7/06;;E21B7/06;;E21B7/068;;E21B7/068,E21B7/06,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Electronic counters. RANK ORGANISATION Ltd. 23 June, 1967 [23 March, 1966], No. 12827/66. Heading G4A. Apparatus for converting from one scale of measurement to another comprises a counter 2 responsive to input pulses and a branch circuit 18 responsive to the same input pulses to delete or repeat a certain proportion before they can be applied to the counter 2. As applied to a helium neon laser interferometer, such as described in Specification 1,126,744, which produces a train of pulses representative of the movement of a target, the wavelength of the laser light has to be converted into inches. By losing one pulse in 291 and dividing by 8,000 a very close approximation is achieved. In the branch circuit as counter 18 passes through 291 in forward or reverse direction so one or other NAND gate 21 or 22 operates to close AND gate 16 to an input pulse. The modified count is registered on binary stages 10-12 and decimal stages 13, 14. Conversion to centimeters may be arranged (Fig. 2, not shown) by emitting the first binary divider 10 and having two additive branch circuits feeding in via delay lines to add one pulse in four and one in fifty, respectively.

March 17, 1964, No. 11223/64. Heading F2B. A shaft seal comprises a metal wear ring 13 which is engaged by a flexible lip 35 of an elastomeric sealing member 34 and is mounted on an elastomeric sleeve 21 which is reinforced at one end by a metal ring 20 bonded thereto and has a lip 25 at its other end that detachably locks the ring 13 on the sleeve. The member 34 is bonded to a flange 32 of an inner case 30 clamped by a spun-over end 42 in an outer case 40 having an offset radial flange 46. A garter spring 36 may be provided to increase the contact pressure of the lip 35 on the surface 16 of the ring 13. When the seal is installed on the shaft to be sealed, the sleeve 21 is compressed between the shaft and the ring 13 and the case 40 is press fitted in a bore in the shaft housing. The radial flange 18 of the ring 13 acts as an oil flinger. In a modification, Fig. 5 (not shown), the sleeve 21 has an integral projection on its bore to fill a keyway in the shaft.

Fuel elements. UNITED KINGDOM ATOMIC ENERGY AUTHORITY. April 7, 1964 [April 8, 1963], No. 13995/63. Heading G6C. A nuclear fuel element comprises an outer container enclosing an annular fuel body and resilient means for urging into intimate contact the surfaces of the fuel and container, to improve heat transfer therebetween. The outer container 18 is of graphite; seven such tubes are mounted between an upper graphite grid 16 and a lower grid 17 to form a fuel assembly. Coolant gas enters the container 18 through a vent 22 in its upper metal cap 19, and passes through reactive graphite 24 and an orifice 25 to the fuel, and thence through porous material 34, 35 to a small bore pipe. The fuel is in the form of annular rings, each ring formed by a number of segments and urged radially outward by a helical graphite member 26c or by a tubular spine 26a having a longitudinal split 26b. The fuel assembly is provided with a ring of electrical contacts 39, e.g. for thermocouple leads. A gas cooled reactor in which the fuel elements described can be used is helium cooled and utilizes a reflector of graphite blocks which are cooled by incoming coolant; moderation is by the graphite fuel element casings. Capillary tubes for each fuel element of each fuel assembly pass through coupling, pressure measuring and filtering devices and thence to the reactor coolant inlet; by this means the integrity of the fuel tubes may be monitored since a failure in a fuel tube will give rise to a marked purge line pressure increase.",ATOMIC ENERGY AUTHORITY UK,BARR PETER;;GOUGH JOHN RICH ARD COX,,https://lens.org/158-873-879-725-486,Granted Patent,no,0,0,8,8,0,G21C3/04;;G21C1/12;;G21C3/041;;G21C3/16;;G21C3/18;;G21C3/3213;;Y02E30/30,G21C1/12;;G21C3/04;;G21C3/16;;G21C3/18;;G21C3/32,G6C CUEE          CUEE;;G6C CUR           CUR;;G6C C324          NA;;G6C C39Y          CUEE;;G6C C39Y          CUR;;G6C C394          CUEE;;G6C C394          CUR;;G6C C47Y          CUEE;;G6C C47Y          CUR;;G6C C472          NA;;G6C C70Y          CUEE;;G6C C70Y          CUR;;G6C C700          NA;;G6C C701          CUEE;;G6C C701          CUR;;G6C C707          CUEE;;G6C C707          CUR;;G6C C712          NA;;G6C C714          CUEE;;G6C C714          CUR;;G6C C716          NA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
