Barnett, A. D. Feb. 9. Coupling ; switches.-In an electric distributor for internal-combustion engines, a rotating member carries a contact-plate, and a stationary enclosing cylinder has holes Bored radially through it holding pairs of balls or rollers pressed apart by springs. These springs complete the circuit at intervals with fixed contacts on an enclosing cylinder. The invention is shown applied to a four-cylinder engine, and also embodies a primary current interrupter on the same principle. Figs. 2 and 3 are sections on A-A and B-B respectively in Fig. 1. An insulating-cylinder 1, surrounded by an insulating-cup 3 carrying the contact-plate 4; is screwed to the shaft 1, driven from the engine. The cup 3 is adjustably fixed by means of a washer 18 having holes 20 and studs 21. A fixed insulating-cylinder 11 has contacts 8 on its inner surface connected to the engine sparking-plugs. A stationary ring member 5 has holes drilled radially therein carrying balls 6 pressed outwardly by springs 7. These conduct the current between plates 4, 8. A lever 17 fixed to the member 5 permits adjustment of the time of ignition by angular movement of this member. A bar 10, crossing the point of the rotating member at a little distance from it, preferably conducts the current to the bar 4, by a lead 9 terminating opposite the pin 13 in the bar 10, the current jumping across the gap. A glass cover 12 is provided. The top face of the cup member 3 also has a contact plate or plates 16, earthed to the shaft and making contacts by way of a second set of balls and springs in the member 5 with a ring 14, connected to the primary of the induction coil and carried on the enclosing insulating-cylinder 11.",BARNETT ALGERNON DAVID,BARNETT ALGERNON DAVID,,https://lens.org/081-817-271-298-211,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The processor also communicates with a high voltage generator (64) that produces the erase and write voltages for the OTPROM and EEPROM. A switch (66) communicates with the high voltage generator and switches the erase and write voltages alternately between the OTPROM and EEPROM. The OTPROM and EEPROM are FLASH arrays.

   A single chip embedded microcontroller has a processor that communicates with multiple non-volatile erasable PROMS which may be an OTPROM and an EEPROM. The processor also communicates with a high voltage generator that produces the erase and write voltages for the OTPROM and EEPROM. A switch communicates with the high voltage generator and switches the erase and write voltages alternately between the OTPROM and EEPROM. The OTPROM and EEPROM are FLASH arrays. The FLASH array technology allows the EEPROM and OTPROM to have similar erase and write voltages and therefore to share one high voltage generator. The high voltage generator is switched alternately between the first and second non-volatile erasable PROM arrays to enforce the principle that the EEPROM and OTPROM cannot be written to or erased at the same and may only be written to or erased one at a time.

   A method for seperating ions is disclosed. A first analyzer region is provided defined by a space between first and second spaced apart electrodes. A second analyser region is defined in operational communication with the first analyzer region and having two electrodes. Ions are provided to one of the first analyzer region and the second analyzer region and then coupled from there to the other analyzer region. A first asymmetric waveform and a first direct-current compensation voltage are applied to electrodes for providing an electric field within the first analyzer region. The first asymmetric waveform is typically selected for effecting a difference in net displacement between two different ions in the time of one cycle of the applied first asymmetric waveform and the first compensation voltage is selected to support selective transmission of a first subset of the ions within the first analyzer region. Conditions are provided within the second analyzer region for effecting a second separation of ions therein to support selective transmission of a second subset of the ions within the second analyzer region.

   A fiber-optic acoustical sensor system includes a light source, an elongate optical cable conducting light from the light source to an optical acoustical transducer located at a distance from the light source along this cable, and a polarizer at the acoustical transducer. The sensor system includes a polarizer providing orthogonally-polarized light along the optical cable to the polarizer located adjacent to the transducer. Because of the polarizer adjacent to the transducer, disturbances of the optical cable and resulting polarization perturbations of the light transmitted along this cable do not affect the optical acoustical transducer. The acoustic transducer is responsive to sound energy to provide an optical return signal indicative of this sound energy. An in-line fiberoptic polarizer suitable for use in this acoustical transducer includes a pair of confronting optical fiber portions aligned along an optical axis and which each define end surfaces disposed at a Brewster polarizer angle with respect to light transmitted along this optical axis. The end surface of one of these optical fibers carries plural alternating sub-layers of high-index and low-index dielectric material, which are effective to p-polarize the transmitted light and substantially eliminate s-polarized light transmission to the optical acoustical transducer.

    A fiber-optic acoustical sensor system includes a light source, an elongate optical cable conducting light from the light source to an optical acoustical transducer located at a distance from the light source along this cable, and a polarizer at the acoustical transducer. The sensor system includes a polarizer providing orthogonally-polarized light along the optical cable to the polarizer located adjacent to the transducer. Because of the polarizer adjacent to the transducer, disturbances of the optical cable and resulting polarization perturbations of the light transmitted along this cable do not affect the optical acoustical transducer. The acoustic transducer is responsive to sound energy to provide an optical return signal indicative of this sound energy. An in-line fiber-optic polarizer suitable for use in this acoustical transducer includes a pair of confronting optical fiber portions aligned along an optical axis and which each define end surfaces disposed at a Brewster polarizer angle with respect to light transmitted along this optical axis. The end surface of one of these optical fibers carries plural alternating sub-layers of high-index and low-index dielectric material, which are effective to p-polarize the transmitted light and substantially eliminate s-polarized light transmission to the optical acoustical transducer.

In addition to supplying DC power to the appliance it is necessary to provide a representation of the timing signal from the AC mains, e.g. by providing an indication of the zero crossing points. The applicant suggests that prior art systems require at least six lines between the power supply and the appliance: two for DC power, two for AC timing and two for communication. The present application reduces the wires used to four or less. This may be achieved by modulating a signal 820 representative of timing of a mains signal with either a data signal 810 or a DC voltage output 310.

    Low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) multichip modules are used to provide high density interconnects between electronic elements. A ceramic carrier includes a number of cavities which are sized to receive a variety of submodules. The submodules are constructed to hold a variety of circuit elements, such as circuit dice and provide the conduction paths for establishing interconnections between these chips. These circuit elements are attached on one side of the submodule and electrical contacts are provided on the opposite side. Upon installation into the cavity in the carrier module, the submodule is flipped such that the electrical connections are exposed. Once in the cavity, a layer of flex circuitry is applied over the submodule and the ceramic carrier in order to establish electrical connection between electrical elements in the submodules as well as components external to the ceramic carrier.

The engagement structure between the valve spool and the armature of the flow control valve is improved, which enables the valve spool and the armature to be automatically aligned. This reduces the precision requirement of contact between the valve spool and armature, which facilitates mass production and reduces cost of the valves.",JOHNSON ELECTRIC SA,KING EDWARD EARL;;BARNETT DAVID HUGO,JOHNSON ELECTRIC INTERNATIONAL AG (2018-09-25);;JOHNSON ELECTRIC S.A (2017-05-08),https://lens.org/001-625-490-896-037,Patent Application,yes,17,0,7,7,0,F01M1/16;;F16K3/262;;F16K3/30;;F16K27/041;;F16K31/0668;;F16K31/0675;;H01F7/1607;;H01F2007/086;;Y10T137/8671;;Y10T137/86702;;F16K11/07;;F16K27/048;;F16K31/0613;;Y10T137/8671;;Y10T137/86702;;H01F7/1607;;H01F2007/086;;F16K11/07;;F16K27/048;;F16K31/0613;;H01F7/064;;H01F7/16,F16K27/04;;F16K11/07;;F16K31/06;;H01F7/06;;H01F7/16,,1,0,,,Translation of WO2016076188,ACTIVE

    Generally, the present invention provides a device for heating the sample stream inlet of an ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) sensor. The heating device increases the temperature of the sample stream inlet surface to reduce the amount of time between adsorption and desorption taking place on the surface. This greatly improves the ability of the IMS sensor to follow rapidly changing analyte concentration levels. An alternate preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a flow smoothing device for decreasing the turbulence present in the fluid flow entering the IMS sensor's carrier stream inlet. This flow smoothing insert permits increasing the fluid flow rate entering the IMS sensor's carrier stream inlet to levels which maximize the IMS sensor's measurement sensitivity without causing mixing of the sample and carrier fluid stream flows.

   A high field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometer (FAIMS) having spherical electrode geometry is disclosed. The spherical FAIMS includes an inner generally spherical electrode supported in a spaced-apart arrangement relative to an outer electrode. The outer electrode has a curved inner surface that maintains an approximately uniform spacing to the inner electrode. The space between the inner and outer electrodes defines an analyzer region, where an electric field is established by the application of an asymmetric waveform voltage and a direct current compensation voltage to at least one of the inner and outer electrodes. An ion inlet and an ion outlet are disposed within the curved inner surface of the outer electrode such that the shortest distance between the inlet and the outlet in any direction around the inner electrode is approximately a same distance.

   ABSTRACT OF DISCLOSURE Low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) multichip modules are used to provide high density interconnects between electronic elements. A ceramic carrier includes a number of cavities which are sized to receive a variety of submodules. The submodules are constructed to hold a variety of circuit elements, such as circuit dice and provide the conduction paths for establishing interconnections between these chips. These circuit elements are attached on one side of the submodule and electrical contacts are provided on the opposite side. Upon installation into the cavity in the carrier module, the submodule is flipped such that the electrical connections are exposed. Once in the cavity, a layer of flex circuitry is applied over the submodule and the ceramic carrier in order to establish electrical connection between electrical elements in the submodules as well as components external to the ceramic carrier.

    A high field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometer (FAIMS) having spherical electrode geometry is disclosed. The spherical FAIMS includes an inner generally spherical electrode supported in a spaced-apart arrangement relative to an outer electrode. The outer electrode has a curved inner surface that maintains an approximately uniform spacing to the inner electrode. The space between the inner and outer electrodes defines an analyzer region, where an electric field is established by the application of an asymmetric waveform voltage and a direct current compensation voltage to at least one of the inner and outer electrodes. An ion inlet and an ion outlet are disposed within the curved inner surface of the outer electrode such that the shortest distance between the inlet and the outlet in any direction around the inner electrode is approximately a same distance.

The sensor system includes a polarizer providing orthogonally-polarized light along the optical cable to the polarizer located adjacent to the transducer. Because of the polarizer adjacent to the transducer, disturbances of the optical cable and resulting polarization perturbations of the light transmitted along this cable do not affect the optical acoustical transducer. The acoustic transducer is responsive to sound energy to provide an optical return signal indicative of this sound energy. An in-line fiber-optic polarizer suitable for use in this acoustical transducer includes a pair of confronting optical fiber portions aligned along an optical axis and which each define end surfaces disposed at a Brewster polarizer angle with respect to light transmitted along this optical axis. The end surface of one of these optical fibers carries plural alternating sub-layers of high-index and low-index dielectric material, which are effective to p-polarize the transmitted light and substantially eliminate s-polarized light transmission to the optical acoustical transducer.",LITTON SYSTEMS INC,FREDERICK DONALD ADAM;;HALL DAVID BARNETT,LITTON SYSTEMS INC (1997-07-15),https://lens.org/088-482-414-832-892,Granted Patent,yes,22,43,1,22,0,G01H9/004;;H04R23/008;;H04R23/008;;G01H9/004,H04R23/00,385/12;;385/11;;367/140;;367/141,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    The present invention relates to a method of separating ions having the same mass to charge ratio but different ion mobility characteristics, based on the ion focussing principles of high field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry. Isomers including gas-phase molecular anions of the amino acids leucine and isoleucine are separable by the method of the present invention. Identification of different conformers of ions at the same charge state, including conformers present at certain charge states of the protein bovine ubiquitin, is also possible using the method of the present invention.

    A method for selectively transmitting ions using a FAIMS device is disclosed. A first analyzer region is defined by a space between first and second spaced apart electrodes. A second analyser region is provided in operational communication with the first analyzer region. Ions are provided to the first analyzer region. The ions are coupled from the first analyser region to the second analyzer region. An asymmetric waveform is used to generate an electric field within the first analyser region and a compensation voltage is applied to prevent some ions from exiting the analyser region. Conditions are provided within the second analyzer region for effecting a second different separation of ions therein. Finally, the separated ions are trapped to accumulate ions within a trapping region thereof.

    A sensor device is positioned in soft tissue in the human or animal body, by providing a tubular member ( 1 ) containing at least one sensor, the tubular member having a distal end ( 7 ) supporting an apertured member ( 30 ). The apertured member ( 30 ) is connected to a surgical needle ( 25 ) by passing a suture ( 24 ) through the aperture of the apertured member ( 30 ) and the eye of the needle ( 25 ), passing the needle ( 25 ) through the soft tissue and drawing the suture ( 24 ) through the soft tissue to pull the tubular member ( 1 ) into the soft tissue. The needle ( 25 ) is disconnected from the sensor device by cutting the suture ( 24 ) or removing the apertured member ( 30 ). In the pulling method of the present invention, the sensor device follows the track of the needle and suture. This reduces tissue damage and also reduces the risk of damaging the sensor as it is positioned.

In order to increase the dynamic range, a first light emitting diode (LED), LED1, transmits a signal over a first fibre core during a positive phase of an input audio signal and a second LED, LED2, transmits a signal over a second fibre core during a negative phase of the input signal. This appears to be referred to as a push-pull configuration in the prior art. This arrangement requires feedback from the first and second light sources (e.g. from the first node between R12 and R13) to a first input of a first amplifier, U1. The first amplifier receives as a second input the input audio signal and the output of the first amplifier is connected to inputs of a second amplifier, U2, and a third amplifier, U3. The first LED is driven by the second amplifier, U2, and the second LED is driven by the third amplifier, U3. A bias controller, U6/Î¼P/U4/U5 receives as an input a bias level measured at (a point referred to as the second node which is) the output of one of the LEDs. The bias controller outputs a signal to the inputs of the second and third amplifiers, which are preferably inverting amplifiers. The first and second LEDs may be connected in series with the two main electrodes of each of the first and second transistors, Q1, Q2, with the second and third amplifiers being connected to respective control electrodes of the transistors.",ICONIC SOUND LTD,BARNETT DANIELLE;;HOLMES DAVID;;KELLETT MICHAEL ANDREW,,https://lens.org/002-773-923-709-366,Patent Application,no,3,0,6,6,0,H04B10/25;;H04B10/50;;H04B10/40;;H04B10/502;;H04B10/25891;;H04B10/25;;H04B10/50;;H04B10/40;;H04B10/502;;H04B10/54;;H04B10/564,H04B10/50;;H04B10/25,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

    By reducing the size of the blocks or pages that are contained in a FLASH EEPROM array that must be erased in a write or erase operation, the size of register needed is reduced, making it easier for the processor to handle smaller blocks of information, reducing the size and complexity of the microprocessor, and increasing the endurance of the FLASH EEPROM allowing it to be used in place of the state of the art EEPROM. Replacing mask ROM by flash EEPROM allows full testing of the code storage area as well as allowing customers to use that space for testing in their manufacturing procedures. The code used for testing can then be cleared and reprogrammed with the final code storage before final shipment.

In the preferred embodiment, the hardware component includes a software controllable switching means for controlling a plurality of lights. In order to identify the type of service needed, lights may be color-coded or different flashing patterns may be used. In the software component, a preferred algorithm which defines and varies the flash rate over time is implemented. The flash rate is defined as being in the on-state for a first specified duration and in the off-state for a second specified duration. Variables specifying the initial first and second specified durations, the final first and second specified durations, the amount of time to lapse before changing the first and second specified durations, and the amount of first and second specified durations to change are provided.
