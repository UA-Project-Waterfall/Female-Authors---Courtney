   The present invention provides methods and system for organizing a dataset in a database by marking the dataset by a plurality of labels generated based on a pre-define policy. The policy determines the data scope accessible to each label. A user of the database can access the data within the scopes of one or more labels based on its role and privileges granted thereto by, for example, a system administrator. Moreover, a variety of shaping transformations can be applied to the tagged dataset to create a derived dataset that is suitable for the informational needs of the user. The derived dataset can be formatted to render it compatible for viewing via a selected presentation engine, such as a web browser.

The sensing system is configured to analyze a physical environment in which the user is located for a tangible object using the sensor(s), to generate a trajectory for navigating the extremity of the user to the tangible object based on a relative position of the extremity of the user bearing the vibration interface to a position of the tangible object within the physical environment, and to guide the extremity of the user along the trajectory by vibrating the vibration interface.",TOYOTA MOTOR CO LTD,MARTINSON ERIC;;SISBOT EMRAH AKIN;;DJUGASH JOSEPH;;OGUCHI KENTARO;;TAKAOKA YUTAKA;;NAKANO YUSUKE,TOYOTA JIDOSHA KABUSHIKI KAISHA (2015-03-06),https://lens.org/046-661-046-761-559,Granted Patent,yes,51,3,2,2,0,G08B6/00;;G08B6/00,G08B6/00,,24,17,089-738-656-495-377;;095-961-967-664-165;;034-422-902-172-199;;137-033-676-525-624;;056-424-293-479-693;;078-431-662-636-994;;029-270-236-495-701;;030-127-369-356-741;;085-309-270-374-774;;145-882-313-734-263;;128-083-522-182-517;;135-086-396-434-441;;057-829-558-069-81X;;122-248-207-057-198;;030-752-977-875-848;;014-329-213-294-121;;006-725-350-772-294,10.1109/icecom.2003.1290948;;10.1109/have.2009.5356126;;10.1145/1463160.1463179;;10.1109/devlrn.2007.4354077;;10.1109/coase.2009.5234148;;10.1007/978-3-540-87883-4_1;;10.1007/978-3-540-30119-6_23;;10.1109/3468.911370;;10.1145/1060581.1060585;;10.1016/s0921-8890(02)00355-x;;10.1109/percomw.2010.5470517;;10.1145/2413097.2413161;;10.1109/tro.2007.907481;;10.1109/biorob.2008.4762827;;10.1109/whc.2013.6548377;;27788071;;10.1109/toh.2010.21;;10.1109/haptic.2012.6183785,"Xia et al., “Human Detection Using Depth Information by Kinect,” Computer Vision and Pattern REcognition Workshops, 2011 IEEE Computer Society Conference on IEEE, 2011 (8 pages).;;U.S. Appl.
