May 8, 1909, [Convention date]. Kites; planes, arrangement and construction of.-An arrangement of supporting-surfaces converging towards the supporting air is described in connexion with kites although it is applicable also to power-driven machines. The kite is constructed of a main curved rib 3 and a transverse curved rib 5, the two being spaced apart by a strut 7, hinged to the rib 3 and detachably secured to the rib 5. The fabric 1 is detachably secured to the ribs and has a central opening 2. The arrangement of the ribs is such that, when the kite is flying, the fabric forms a hopper with the opening 2 as the base. To assist in this formation, the lateral sides of the opening are connected by straps or by a spreader rib 9. The whole device may be collapsed and folded up. A theoretical investigation into the action on the air of such an arrangement of planes, directed to show that automatic stability is obtained, is embodied in the Specification.",ANDREWS ROBERT DAY,ANDREWS ROBERT DAY,,https://lens.org/136-439-966-018-317,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,A63H27/08;;A63H27/08,B64C31/06,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The wires may be thermocouple or strain gauge wires, e.g. 0À001 inch diameter. The wires 10, 11 are placed within an inner sleeve 13 so that they abut substantially centrally of the sleeve bore 12. To facilitate such centring, one of the wires may be tagged at a distance from its end of half the sleeve length. The inner sleeve may be of thickness similar to the wire diameter, its bore may be flared at its ends 15 to facilitate wire entry, and, to hold the wires firmly during welding, its bore diameter may be only slightly larger than the wire diameter. To provide rigidity for the arrangement during welding, an outer sleeve 16 of substantial thickness is slidden over the inner sleeve. Both sleeves may be of ceramics. To weld the wires, the outer sleeve is heated, e.g. by oxy-acetylene flame and the heat is conducted to the inner sleeve bore 12 to fuse the wires together. Axial pressure on the wires may be necessary. The outer sleeve is then slidden off the inner sleeve, and the latter is removed by crushing since end thickening of the wires prevents removal by sliding.",ROLLS ROYCE,JEFFS JOHN ROBERT;;ANDREWS MARJORIE,,https://lens.org/199-059-086-132-526,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,B23K20/028;;B23K2101/32,B23K20/02,B3R R14           -;;B3R R140          -;;B3R R141          -;;B3R R18X          -;;B3R R32B          -;;B3R R36           -;;B3R R37B          -;;B3R R37X          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

For neurosurgical applications, the instrument is mounted on a stereotactic frame for the probe to penetrate the brain in a precisely controlled fashion. The resistance of the brain tissue being penetrated is continually monitored by a miniaturized strain gauge attached to the probe tip. Other modality sensors may be mounted near the probe tip to provide real-time tissue characterizations and the ability to detect the proximity of blood vessels, thus eliminating errors normally associated with registration of pre-operative scans, tissue swelling, elastic tissue deformation, human judgement, etc., and rendering surgical procedures safer, more accurate, and efficient. A neural network program adaptively learns the information on resistance and other characteristic features of normal brain tissue during the surgery and provides near real-time modeling. Identification of abnormal brain tissue is determined by the detection of change and comparison with previously learned models of abnormal brain tissues. The operation of the instrument is controlled through a user friendly graphical interface.

The infusion apparatus also allows a user to control the amount of infused fluid without requiring syringe changes.",APPLING WILLIAM M.;;ANDREWS ROBERT TORRANCE,APPLING WILLIAM M;;ANDREWS ROBERT TORRANCE,ANGIODYNAMICS INC (2004-07-28),https://lens.org/069-448-080-740-761,Patent Application,yes,4,21,2,2,0,A61M5/14;;A61M5/158;;A61M39/22;;A61M5/158;;A61M5/14;;A61M39/22,A61M5/14;;A61M5/158;;A61M39/22,604/246,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

    A system with multimodality instrument for tissue identification includes a computer-controlled motor driven heuristic probe with a multisensory tip. For neurosurgical applications, the instrument is mounted on a stereotactic frame for the probe to penetrate the brain in a precisely controlled fashion. The resistance of the brain tissue being penetrated is continually monitored by a miniaturized strain gauge attached to the probe tip. Other modality sensors may be mounted near the probe tip to provide real-time tissue characterizations and the ability to detect the proximity of blood vessels, thus eliminating errors normally associated with registration of pre-operative scans, tissue swelling, elastic tissue deformation, human judgement, etc., and rendering surgical procedures safer, more accurate, and efficient. A neural network program adaptively learns the information on resistance and other characteristic features of normal brain tissue during the surgery and provides near real-time modeling. A fuzzy logic interface to the neural network program incorporates expert medical knowledge in the learning process. Identification of abnormal brain tissue is determined by the detection of change and comparison with previously learned models of abnormal brain tissues. The operation of the instrument is controlled through a user friendly graphical interface. Patient data is presented in a 3D stereographics display. Acoustic feedback of selected information may optionally be provided. Upon detection of the close proximity to blood vessels or abnormal brain tissue, the computer-controlled motor immediately stops probe penetration. The use of this system will make surgical procedures safer, more accurate, and more efficient. Other applications of this system include the detection, prognosis and treatment of breast cancer, prostate cancer, spinal diseases, and use in general exploratory surgery.

Since the bearing adapter is attached to a bearing carrier, misalignment of the protuberances and the slots allow the bevel gear and several other assorted components to be retained in contact with the bearing carrier so that the components are not free to move in axial directions away from each other to allow separation of these components.

For neurosurgical applications, the instrument is mounted on a stereotactic frame for the probe to penetrate the brain in a precisely controlled fashion. The resistance of the brain tissue being penetrated is continually monitored by a miniaturized strain gauge attached to the probe tip. Other modality sensors may be mounted near the probe tip to provide real-time tissue characterizations and the ability to detect the proximity of blood vessels, thus eliminating errors normally associated with registration of pre-operative scans, tissue swelling, elastic tissue deformation, human judgement, etc., and rendering surgical procedures safer, more accurate, and efficient. A neural network program adaptively learns the information on resistance and other characteristic features of normal brain tissue during the surgery and provides near real-time modeling. A fuzzy logic interface to the neural network program incorporates expert medical knowledge in the learning process. Identification of abnormal brain tissue is determined by the detection of change and comparison with previously learned models of abnormal brain tissues.

One GaAs photoconductor, the sampling photoconductor, is illuminated. The other GaAs photoconductor remains dark and functions as a common mode compensating photoconductor. To sample an unknown electrical waveform traversing the stripline the electrical wave is optically strobed by illuminating the sampling GaAs photoconductor with pulses of light from a laser. To sample an unknown optical waveform the optical wave is focused on the sampling GaAs photoconductor and an electrical strobe signal is sent through the stripline. Outputs from each of the photoconductors are amplified in high input impedance FET amplifiers and after electrical compensation they are passed to a conventional difference amplifier. The difference output is further amplified and fed to a conventional sampling oscilloscope. The sampling oscilloscope provides a conventional DC feedback control voltage to stabilize the bridge circuit and a strobe synchronization pulse for controlling either the electrical or optical strobe.

A predistortion database (20) contains gain and phase corrections for various transmission types and a separate automatic gain control database (38) contains fine amplifier gain corrections. A real-time processor (26) combines the two types of corrections and applies them to the amplifier input signals, and a background processor (16) continually updates both databases in accordance with a programmable priority scheme. Integration of predistortion and amplifier power control is achieved in a manner that minimizes adverse effects of one type of control on the other. One feature of the invention provides for rapid convergence of the predistortion correction.

The setting angle relative to the corresponding prismatic blade is therefore fine at the root and tip and coarse at the blade mid-height. The throat opening is thus reduced at root and tip and increased at mid-height so displacing some mass flow away from both lossy end wall regions. A considerable gain in the stage efficiency results.

[Also in Division H3] In frequency modulating an oscillator, a capacitance diode is shunted by a Zener diode of temperature dependent breakdown voltage to compensate for temperature changes. The diode modulating voltage may be obtained from a bridge having a strain gauge in one arm so that an encapsulated system may transmit VHF/FM telemetering information from a turbine rotor to the stator, through a casing window in the rotor. Electrical power may be transmitted to the rotor from a 200 mc/s oscillator by capacitive coupling between closely adjacent rings on the stator and rotor, the received oscillation being then rectified and smoothed to provide a D.C. power supply.

In a multiplex system for measuring devices carried by the rotor of rotary machinery, an electronic switch on the rotor is arranged to connect the devices in turn to output means for transferring signals developed in the devices to or beyond the stator of the machinery. As shown, each of nine resistance strain gauges S1. . . . S9 on the rotor of a turbo-compressor is connected in the emitter-collector circuit of a transistor; and the strain gauge-transistor circuits are disposed in three separate parallel-connected groups, each group being connected to an indicating device 15 via a pair of slip-rings 11, 11<SP>1</SP>. The strain gauges in each group are connected to the associated indicating device in sequence by a ring counter 21, comprising three transistorised Eccles-Jordan trigger circuits each connected to the base of one transistor in each group; the counter 21 is operated by a conventional pulse generating circuit 27 on the stator via sliprings 26. Alternatively the strain-gauges may be connected sequentially into a resistive bridge whose output modulates the frequency of a VHF transmitter on the rotor, as described in Specification 984, 286; the pulse generator is preferably also carried on the rotor and is energized by batteries on the rotor or by an oscillator on the stator capacitance-coupled to rectifiers on the rotor.",BRISTOL SIDDELEY ENGINES LTD,ANDREWS STUART ALEXANDER;;LEWIS MORGAN WYNNE;;HEARN JOHN ROBERT,,https://lens.org/024-151-832-309-094,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G08C15/06,G08C15/06,G1N NAHH          AHHD;;G1N NAHH          AHHG;;G1N NAHHD         AHHD;;G1N N1A3A         AHHD;;G1N N1A3A         AHHG;;G1N N1A3B         AHHD;;G1N N1A3B         AHHG;;G1N N1D2B         AHHD;;G1N N1F           AHHD;;G1N N1F           AHHG;;G1N N3S15         AHHD;;G1N N3S15         AHHG;;G1N N3S4          AHHD;;G1N N3S4          AHHG;;G1N N4F1          AHHD;;G1N N4F2          AHHD;;G1N N7N           AHHD,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

An image displayed such as by an interactive system is adjusted based on physical attributes associated with the user or other characteristics of the user in order to customize the image being displayed. For some embodiments, change to the image includes dynamically resizing and/or repositioning a projected display based on the size and reach of the user to make items shown in the display such as menus or hyperlinks more easily accessible to the user. Input from a camera of the interactive system can be utilized to detect the attribute such as a height of the user for correlation to a typical reach of the user.

The distributed rate limiting involves graduated monitoring to identify when an attack expands beyond a single server to other servers operating from within the same distributed platform distribution point, and when the attack further expands from one distributed platform distribution point to other distribution points. Once request rates across the distributed platform distribution points exceed a global threshold, a first set of attack protections are invoked across the distributed platform. Should request rates increase or continue to exceed the threshold, additional attack protections can be invoked. Distributed rate limiting allows any server within the distributed platform to assume command and control over the graduated monitoring as well as escalating the response to any identified attack.",VERIZON DIGITAL MEDIA SERVICES INC,ANDREWS DAVID;;MORRISON REED;;SHIELL DEREK;;PETERS ROBERT J,EDGECAST INC (2021-11-01);;EDGIO INC (2022-10-21),https://lens.org/125-699-988-441-118,Granted Patent,yes,38,4,2,2,0,H04L63/1458;;H04L63/1458;;H04L63/1416;;H04L63/1425;;H04L63/1425;;H04L67/10;;H04L67/10;;H04L67/1097;;H04L67/1097,H04L29/06;;H04L29/08,,1,0,,,"RockyKCChang-Defending against Flooding-based DDOS Attacks, Pub. dt: Oct. 2002.",ACTIVE

   A system and method for automatically loading a pre-selected value onto a fare card allows a patron to enter or leave a transit system gate without having to add a fare value at a vending machine. The automatic loading provides added convenience and security for the patron. The vehicle for the automatically-loaded value is either a credit card that is pre-authorized for use by the patron, or the patron's available benefits. The automatic loading process may be utilized to autoload values of benefits only, or to load values from a combination of benefits and credit card transactions. The pre-selected autoload value is loaded onto the fare card at the gate before confirmation that the credit card transaction is authorized. The gate sends a message to a transit central computer that an autoload has occurred. The central computer determines whether benefits are available to fill the request, and forwards a request for the difference to a credit processing company.

If the download process is interrupted before the update can be verified, a pointer still points to the existing code to facilitate update-interruption recovery. After verifying a successful update, a new pointer is generated that points to the updated operating system. Then, updated application code can be downloaded and stored in the flash memory over the old operating system code. Thus, each time an update is performed, the location of the operating system within the flash memory with respect to the location of the application code is inverted. This allows the size of flash memory to be reduced, as only one copy of the operating system and application code must be stored, while retaining capability to recovery from an incomplete download.",ARRIS INT INC,WINTERS DEREK;;WALSTON ALLEN;;ANDREWS JEFF;;EASTERLING ROBERT;;ENDERBY RUSSELL,ARRIS INTERNATIONAL INC (2003-03-14);;ARRIS ENTERPRISES LLC (2013-04-16);;ARRIS GROUP INC (2006-10-31),https://lens.org/052-962-214-583-197,Granted Patent,yes,6,10,4,4,0,G06F8/654;;G06F8/654,G06F12/02;;G06F9/445,711/165;;711/103;;711/105,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A system and method for automatically loading a pre-selected value onto a smart card allows a patron to enter or leave a transit system gate without having to add a fare value at a vending machine. The automatic loading provides added convenience and security for the patron. The vehicle for the automatically-loaded value is either a credit card that is pre-authorized for use by the patron, or the patron's available benefits. The automatic loading process may be utilized to autoload values of benefits only, or to load values from a combination of benefits and credit card transactions. The pre-selected autoload value is loaded onto the smart card at the gate before confirmation that the credit card transaction is authorized. The gate sends a message to a transit central computer that an autoload has occurred. The central computer determines whether benefits are available to fill the request, and forwards a request for the difference to a credit processing company.

A pair of second differential output shafts are rotated in opposite directions by output power of the motor, so that when turning, the first differential output shaft on the opposite side of the turning direction is accelerated.",TUFF TORQ CORP,HASEGAWA TOSHIYUKI;;MCCLOUD TRAVIS S;;ANDREWS KEITH J;;ABEND ROBERT,,https://lens.org/122-248-075-641-682,Granted Patent,yes,102,3,7,7,0,B60K17/105;;B60Y2200/223;;B62D11/006;;B62D11/18;;B62D11/183;;F16H47/04;;F16H2047/045;;B60K17/105;;B62D11/18;;B62D11/183;;F16H2047/045;;B62D11/006;;B60Y2200/223;;F16H47/04,B62D11/18;;B62D11/00;;F16H47/04,180/6.2;;180/6.44;;180/6.48,18,0,,,"Excel Industries Inc., ""U-T-R The Ultimate Turning Raduis, "" pp. 1-6, Dec. 1992.;;Electric Tractor Corporation, ""An Idea Whose Time Has Come,"" 5 pages, date of publication unknown, published in Ontario, Canada.;;Electric Tractor Corporation, Model #9620- The Ultimate Lawn and Garden Tractor, 6 pages, printed, Jul. 27, 1998.;;Farm Show Magazine, ""Battery Powered Riding Mower,"" 1 page, date of publication, Mar.-Apr. 1996.;;Deere & Company, ""240, 245, 260, 265, 285 and 320 Lawn and Garden Tractors, Technical Manual,"" front cover and pp. 10-2 to 10-4 and 10-6, dated Sep. 26, 1996.;;Excel Industries, Inc., ""Hustler 4000 Series,"" product brochure, pp. 1-8, Dec. 1995.;;Woods Equipment Company, ""Woods Mow'n Machine,"" product brochure, pp. 1-12, Dec. 1997.;;Ex-Mark, ""ExMark Nobody Does It Better-Professional Turf Care Equipment,"" pp. 1-20, Dec. 1997.;;Dixon Industries, Inc., ""Dixon ZTR Riding Mowers,"" pp. 1-4, Dec. 1997.;;Shivers Mfg., ""Zero Turn Radius Mower-The Commercial Clipper,"", pp. 1-4, Dec. 1997.;;Ogorkiewicz, R.

   A glasses-free autostereoscopic viewing environment based on a large-diameter, concave vacuum-controlled mirror allows the user to view and interact with a floating hologram-like image in real time, without the use of special peripheral devices such as shutter glasses. This technology creates the unique ability to vary focal length over a wide range, yielding superior quality stereo images. Compatibility allows PCs or high-end graphics workstations to drive the system. It also easily interfaces with most haptic devices. A telepresence embodiment allows remote viewing of a live or recorded scene while giving the user the feeling of immersion at the remote site. The remote system consists of a site sensor platform containing stereo cameras and microphones. The platform's patented ability to pan, tilt, and/or roll delivers enhanced control of the captured visual and aural images of the remote site. When captured, any telecommunications system (e.g. mobile phone, Internet, or ISDN) can deliver these images to the home site.
