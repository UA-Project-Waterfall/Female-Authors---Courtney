Ltd. 5 Dec., 1968 [7 Dec., 1967], No. 55686/67. Heading G4P. A binary fluidic logic device which may form one stage of a shift register or counter comprises elements A, B, C respectively having input 10 and outputs 12, 14; input 27 and outputs 28, 30; input 34 and outputs 36, 38. Element A is monostable. A pulse at 10 normally flows to 12, but in the presence of a control signal at 16 flows to 14. Element B is bi-stable. Element C is monostable and receives at input 34 a signal whose presence or absence represents 1 or 0. In the absence of a control signal at 24 the input signal passes to output 36. When employed as one stage of a shift register, if there is an O-bit signal at input 34 a shift pulse at 10 passes via 12 into 24 and into 26 to cause the power jet of bi-stable B to exit at output 30 to represent a O-bit. Output 30 is connected to the input 34 of the next stage of the register. If there is a 1-bit signal at 34 the shift pulse at 10 leaves A by 14, part flowing through 20 and 16 to maintain bias on the shift pulse and part flowing to 22 to cause the power jet of bi-stable B to exit at output 28, the lack of flow at 30 representing a 1-bit. Passages Y, Z shown in skeleton may be used to set all bi-stables B in the register to ""O"" on applying a pulse to the Z passages, or to reset them to ""1"" by pulsing the Y passages. When employed as a stage in a counter input 34 of element C is connected to the output 30 of the element B. Successive input pulses at 10 set bi-stable B alternately to 1 and 0, the bi-stable being coupled by meansnot shown to the input 10 of the next stage.",BRITISH AIRCRAFT CORP LTD,BARKER HAROLD FREDERICK,,https://lens.org/120-384-185-853-145,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,F15C1/12,F15C1/12,G4P P10R          -;;G4P P2F           -;;G4P P4F           P;;G4P P7W           P;;G4P P9C           P;;G4P P9Y           P,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Oct. 7. Jet-wheels; regulating; reversing; working- fluid supply. - Relates to internal - combustion engines of the type comprising one or more units each consisting of a pair of cylinders, partly filled with water, which are provided at their upper ends with admission and exhaust valves and ignition devices, and communicate with one another at their lower ends through a casing provided with a turbine from the shaft of which power is taken off. The principal feature of the invention is that the circuits of the ignition devices are made and broken by the rise and fall of the water in the cylinders, the water coming into direct contact with an insulated contact forming part of each ignition circuit. In the arrangement shown in Fig. 1, the turbine casing 10 and cylinders 1, 1<1> are filled with water from a pipe 32 up to the level of the cocks 35, and at starting, combustible mixture is drawn into both cylinders by means of a suction pump connected to the pipe 24. Upon ignition of the mixture in, say, the cylinder 1<1> by the closing of a switch, the water is driven past the turbine 3 into the cylinder 1, compressing the charge therein. As soon as the water comes into contact with the igniting- device 21, a spark is produced at the plug 20 and ignition occurs in the cylinder 1, driving the water back through the turbine 3 to the cylinder 1'. The rush of water past the plate 15 opens the exhaust valve 13, but as soon as the water passes below the level of the plate, the exhaust valve closes under the action of the spring 16 and fresh combustible charge is sucked in through an admission valve (not shown). A fresh explosion then occurs in the cylinder 1<1>, and the action of the apparatus becomes continuous and automatic. A by-pass connecting the lower ends of the two cylinders may be opened to facilitate starting. In a modification. the turbine 3 may be mounted in a casing through which the water flows in one direction only, as shown in Figs. 5 and 6, valves 45, 46 being fitted in the chambers 42, 41 beneath the cylinders 1, 1<1> to direct the flow in the proper direction. In this case, the by-pass valve 49 may be fitted between the chambers 41, 42 and may serve for regulating the volume of liquid flowing through the turbine as well as for starting. Reversal may be effected by a separate turbine wheel mounted in the shaft 4 and a valve for diverting the stream of liquid through it. The water may be cooled by means of a condenser through which a portion of the water may be diverted at every stroke. The exhaust valves may be operated electrically by means of electro-magnets inserted in circuits which are made and broken at the required times by the rise and fall of the water in the cylinders of the engine.",HILL FREDERICK BARKER;;BEST WILLIAM GEORGE,HILL FREDERICK BARKER;;BEST WILLIAM GEORGE,,https://lens.org/182-921-961-175-405,Patent Application,no,0,1,1,1,0,F03B3/00;;F01B21/00;;F01D1/026;;F02C5/00;;Y02E10/20,F01B21/00;;F01D1/02;;F02C5/00;;F03B1/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

In n the apparatus shown as an example, air issuing from a pipe d atomizes alcohol issuing from a pipe c, and the mixture passes to a chamber e where it impinges on carbide supported on a sieve f. The water present generates acetylene in contact with the carbide, and the heat liberated further assists the vaporization of the alcohol. The final mixture of air, acetylene, and alcohol vapour passes by the pipe b to the combustion chamber.

Dargue, W., Dargue, F. L., and Barker, H. June 25. Dyeing ; washing.-In a dyeing, mordanting, or washing machine in which hanks are traversed vertically through the dye &c. liquor on carriers slung from rollers on a lifter-frame above the vat, means are provided for interlocking the controlling-levers of the gears which rotate the rollers and lift their frame, for locking the lever of the lifting-gear until the rollers are free to move into or out of their driving-sockets, and for automatically stopping the lifting-gear and the gear which traverses the frame and rollers away from the vat. Reference is made to Specification No. 7060, A.D. 1903. The hank carriers each consist of upper and lower rollers 47, 52, Fig. 12, connected by loose brackets 48, 51 and jointed arms 49, 50. The joints of the arms 49, 50 are knuckled to cause the arms to fold inwards when the roller 52 is raised towards the roller 47 to receive the hanks, The hanks are stretched by the weight of sand &c. contained in the hollow roller 52, and are prevented from lapping round the rollers by V-shaped guards 53, 54 of thin metal &c. attached to the brackets 48, 51. When in position above the vat, the rollers 47 at one end 14', Fig. 6, engage in sockets 13 on spindles 12, Figs. 1, 3, and 6, which are driven from worms 11. These worms are driven from a main shaft 1 through gearing controlled by a lever 8 and a clutch-rod within the shaft 1. Drums 5, 7 carrying the lifting and traversing ropes of the lifter-frame are similarly driven from shafts 3, 6 fitted with internal clutch-rods controlled by levers 9, 10. In the arrangements for interlocking the levers 8, 9 and for locking the lifting-gear lever 9, a box or guide 23 on the frame 16 is formed with guide-ways for vertical and horizontal bolts 26, 20 connected to the levers 8, 9. These ways overlap, and the bolts are cut away in rectangular notches, so that both are free to move when both levers 8, 9 are in their vertical or "" off"" positions ; movement of either lever 8 or 9 locks the other. The bolt 20 also carries two teeth 21, 22, which prevent it from being moved until a notched disc 15', driven synchronously with the wheels 2 and sockets 13 by a wheel 15 and one of the worms 11. presents its notches 18, 19 to the teeth 21, 22. This occurs when the sockets 13 are in position to receive or free the roller-heads 14<1>. The stopping-mechanism of the lifting-gear consists of a worm 27, Fig. 10, turning with the shaft 3 and driving a shaft 29 which carries a worm.wheel 28, a single-toothed wheel 31, and a locking-plate 35. The wheel 31 drives a loose wheel 32 on a stud 33, and the plate 35 co-operates with a stopplate 36 to lock the wheel 32 except while the tooth 31<1> is acting. When the gear has performed a predetermined number of revolutions, the wheels 31, 32 are stopped by a piece 34 on the wheel 32, and the wheel 31 then acts as a rack to slide the worm 27 along the shaft 3, carrying the clutch rod 3<1> with it until the clutch is in the ""off"" position. Two or more stops 34 may be provided on the wheel 32, and two or more teeth 31<1> on the wheel 31, according to the arrangements of the driving- gear. A similar arrangement is provided for stopping the rotation of the shaft 6 which drives the traversing-mechanism.",DARGUE WALTER;;DARGUE FREDERICK LEWIN;;BARKER HERBERT,DARGUE WALTER;;DARGUE FREDERICK LEWIN;;BARKER HERBERT,,https://lens.org/144-801-985-512-213,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

[Cognate Application No. 2874, A.D. 1908, dated Feb. 8.] Carburetting.-A carburetting-plant comprises a pumping-bell automatically operated by water pressure, a carburettor in which air is drawn through or over the surface of hydrocarbon, and a holder into which the carburetted air is forced, the whole being preferably arranged in a water tank, and all the joints being preferably formed by liquid seals. The bell b is raised by water supplied through a pipe 12, the water supply being controlled by tappets 31, 32. Air is thereby sucked in through a valve f, pipes g, j, condensing chamber i, pipes m, n, and a submerged perforated hood q connected to a float p, and the carburetted air is drawn into the bell b through a valve w, cylinder y, and telescopic pipe 7. The bell b falls by gravity and forces the gas back through the pipe 7, cylinder y, valve 3, and telescopic pipe 14 into the gas holder c, which it leaves by a pipe 18. The ends of the pipes 7, 14, 18 are provided with mixing boxes 7<a>. The exhaust water from the cylinder 8 passes into the tank d, which is provided with an overflow 33 and a heating-coil 34. The height of the tube n in the chamber r serves to indicate the level of hydrocarbon in the carburettor a. The composition of the gas may be adjusted by admitting a subsidiary air supply through a graduated valve on a branch pipe leading into the pipe 7. In a modification the air may be drawn from the chamber i through pipes 41, Fig. 5, opening into nozzles 44, the air thus drawing in vapour from the surface of the liquid through the openings 52. Parts of the apparatus, such as the bell b, may be duplicated. Nozzles of other shapes than those shown may be employed, and in some cases the hydrocarbon is drawn or injected into a mixing-chamber by the air in the form of a spray or mist which becomes absorbed by the air.",HILL FREDERICK BARKER;;WESTWOOD GEORGE JAMES WILLIAM,HILL FREDERICK BARKER;;WESTWOOD GEORGE JAMES WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/021-822-326-000-786,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

F., Barker, J. L., and Whittaker, J. Oct. 24. Cutting tubes of cylindrical form &c. transversely to their length.-In apparatus for cutting tubular cloth helically into long lengths of cloth upon the bias, as described in Specification 10,683/07, the cloth is conveyed to the drawing-off rollers B, C from the stationary cylinder A by a single endless spiked chain or inextensible band G. This chain &c. may be arranged to engage the severed cloth at its edges or medially, or a separate chain may be used for each purpose. A chain of the pattern shown in Fig. 10 is preferably employed, having spikes g on alternate vertical links. This chain is arranged to travel in a groove H with the spikes g projecting in a groove between bars h<1> which serve to keep the material on the spikes. The groove H may be provided with antifriction rollers. The cloth is delivered to the cylinder A by rollers p, Fig. 7, from a beam R carried by a rotary frame P. The front of this frame is of annular form, and is fitted with rollers p<1> engaging a fixed annular cradle R'. The rollers p are rotated through gearing from pinions s which rotate on a fixed wheel s' when the frame P is rotated. The under portion of the cylinder A may be cut away in the vicinity of the chain groove thereby enabling the drawing-off roller B to be placed nearer to the cylinder. The cloth is pressed on the spiked chain immediately before it reaches the cutter by a reciprocating brush &c. E, and a resilient or screw-operated brush or plate may be used to remove creases from the cloth before severance. Vertical-cutter type for cutting sheet material in direction of feed.-The severed strip of cloth may be subdivided into smaller strips by a series of adjustable disk cutters K', Fig. 9, coacting with grooves in the drawing-off rollers B. Alternatively, the roller B may be replaced by a series of narrow drums with the cutters working between them. The grooves &c. are kept clean by fingers N engaging therewith, and an adjustable bar M presses the cloth on the roller B during the cutting operation.

BRITISH UNITED SHOE MACHINERY CO. Ltd. Sept. 19, 1962 [Sept. 21, 1961], Nos. 33746/61 and 24796/62. Heading B3U. A fastener inserting machine comprises a reciprocable die holder, a fastener support comprising jaws urged towards one another, reciprocable in the same direction as the die holder and arranged to support in the path of a die carried by the die holder a fastener to be inserted, driving means for effecting reciprocation of the die holder and fastener support and actuating means interconnecting the die holder and fastener support for effecting relative movement therebetween, whereby the die carried by the die holder is caused to engage a fastener supported by the jaws and thereafter the jaws are opened to release the fastener prior to its insertion into the workpiece. Construction.-The machine comprises a frame 10 in which is mounted a lower die 14 and a reciprocating driver bar 30 which carries an upper die 32 which has a spring-pressed central nipple pin. The driver bar 30 is connected to an eccentric pin 52 on the shaft 40 which is driven through a treadle-operated one-revolution clutch. In front of the driver bar 30 is mounted a carrier 56 which reciprocates with the driver bar but also has movement relative to the bar. This movement is produced by a cam-operated lever 60, Figs. 2 and 4 (not shown), and a three-armed lever 64. The lever 64 is pivoted at 63 to a projecting ear 62 on the driver bar and has a roller 66 at one end which runs in a slot 68 in the carrier 56. Another arm carries a roller 74 which is maintained, by a spring 70, in contact with a flat vertical face 76 of the lever 60. The lever 60 is pivoted at 78 and has a roller 80 which runs on a cam 82, driven from the shaft 40 by bevel gears 88 and 90. At the lower end of the carrier 56 a pair of spring- closed jaws 100 are pivoted on pins 102, 104, Fig. 6 (not shown), the jaws have shoulders which provide support for the flange of an eyelet E. The jaws are opened by two pins 110 mounted on the driver bar which engage cam faces 112 on the jaws. Feeding eyelets.-A hopper 124 is mounted on three inclined tangentially arranged springs and is vibrated by an electromagnet 132. There is a bevel around the periphery of the floor and eyelets ride along the wall 129, Figs. 10 and 12 (not shown), with their flanges in the groove, up an inclined face 138 to a tangential exit channel 144. Eyelets 150 which are incorrectly orientated are deflected by a block 146, 154 to the interior of the hopper. Those which enter the channel 144 pass into a raceway 122 and travel down to a feed disc 170, Fig. 3 (not shown), mounted on a vertical spindle and intermittently rotated by a Geneva mechanism 176, 178 driven from the shaft 86 which carries the bevel gear 88. Eyelets are transferred from the disc 170 to the carrier 56 by two thin spring fingers 182 which engage the parts of the eyelet projecting above and below the feed disc. The fingers are mounted on an arm 184 secured to a vertical shaft 186. A second arm 188 also secured to the shaft is connected by a link 190 to a lever 194 which is pivoted at 197 and carries a roller 202 which is maintained, by a spring 198, in contact with a cam 204 also mounted on the shaft 86. Operation.-With a workpiece positioned over the lower die 14 the clutch is tripped and the driver bar 30 and carrier 56 descend together with the lever 60 swinging through a small angle so that the driver advances relative to the carrier and the nipple pin enters the eyelet. Relative movement between the driver bar and carrier then ceases until the latter part of the stroke is reached when the driver bar again advances and opens the jaws 100, thereafter the carrier remains stationary while the upper die sets the eyelet. In a modification to the hopper the raceway instead of being rigidly connected to the frame of the machine and spaced from the hopper by a sufficient amount to allow for the vibration of the hopper, is connected to the hopper or the hopper mounting through a resilient coupling.",BRITISH UNITED SHOE MACHINERY,PRETTY FREDERICK ALEXANDER;;BARKER JOSEPH;;BARNICOT WILLIAM TREVOR;;MAWBEY LAWRENCE;;GIPPS LOUIS HENRY FITZROY PEMB,,https://lens.org/117-488-137-403-017,Granted Patent,no,0,0,4,4,0,A41H37/02;;A41H37/02;;A43D100/02;;A43D100/02,A41H37/02;;A43D100/02,B3U U1F           -;;B3U U1K           -;;B3U U1LX          -;;B3U U2B           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    To pump fluid into sample containers, a distributor arm of a sample collector is calibrated as to position in a computer memory and is moved from position to position over different containers while a counter in computer memory keeps track of its position. When the distributor arm is over the designated container, samples are pumped into the container. To pump the fluid into the container, the rollers of a peristaltic pump are supported to prevent the rollers from compressing the tube more than the thickness of the walls of the tube. A tube holder rotates along with the roller assembly of the peristaltic pump and keeps the tube in line with the rollers.

Another embodiment uses compound or other extensive roping and an extra large traction machine to permit returning a totally empty car frame to pick up a subsequent freight container.",OTIS ELEVATOR CO,BENNETT PAUL;;POWELL BRUCE A;;WAN SAMUEL C;;WIERSCHKE GILBERT W;;COONEY ANTHONY;;MCCARTHY RICHARD C;;BITTAR JOSEPH;;BARKER FREDERICK H,,https://lens.org/144-130-157-110-900,Patent Application,yes,2,4,5,5,0,B66B9/00;;B66B9/003;;B66B9/003;;B66B11/02;;B66B11/0206;;B66B2201/304;;B66B2201/306,B66B9/16;;B66B1/14;;B66B1/18;;B66B1/24;;B66B9/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
