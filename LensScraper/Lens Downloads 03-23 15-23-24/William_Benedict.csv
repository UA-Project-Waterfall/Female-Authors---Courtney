The viscous coupling is electrically controlled by means of a fan controller which controls the coupling torque by comparing an actual fan speed signal with a required fan speed signal. The control system generates a fan demand signal according to the cooling demands of the engine as determined by an engine control unit (ECU) in accordance with signals representing ambient temperature and coolant temperature and according to additional cooling demands such as the vehicle air conditioning and transmission oil cooler. The fan demand signal is moderated by a moderator (e.g. look-up table or map) which calculates the required fan speed (no) from instantaneous values of the fan demand signal (df) and the coupling input speed (ni). The demands of fan speed are kept close to the speeds that can be matched by the coupling so that a reduction in engine speed, particularly a return from a cruise speed to an idle speed, does not result in a rapid filling of the coupling.",FORD GLOBAL TECH LLC,HUTCHINS WILLIAM RICHARD;;WICKSTEED BENEDICT CHARLES,,https://lens.org/108-293-749-590-179,Patent Application,no,2,12,3,3,0,F01P7/02;;F16D33/06;;F01P7/042;;F16D48/06;;F16D2500/10418;;F16D2500/10487;;F16D2500/30415;;F16D2500/3064;;F16D2500/30803;;F16D2500/3122;;F16D2500/3161;;F16D2500/70442;;G05D13/02;;G05D23/1902,G05D13/02;;F01P7/02;;F01P7/04;;F16D33/06;;F16D48/06;;G05D23/19,F2W WB            WB;;F2W W016          WB;;F2W W246          WB;;G3R RA42          BN29;;G3R RBN29         BN29;;G3R RB23          BN29;;G3R RB436         BN29,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

Machines for moulding and stacking cheese slabs &c. SWIFT & CO. Aug. 29, 1955, No. 24755/55. Class 87(2). [Also in Groups XVII and XXX] A machine for moulding cheese slabs and delivering them, interleaved with dividing sheets, in stacks comprises a frame 15 supporting a mould-carrying conveyer 17, means 25 for feeding dividing sheets and means 27 for depositing plastic cheese material in the moulds,- tamping means 29 to flatten and mould the material on the dividing sheets and transfer means 33 for removing the products and forming stacks thereof. The moulds 23 are carried by conveyer chains 18 driven by sprockets 19 on a shaft 20, and supported during part of their travel by a horizontal frame member 24 and by tension-retaining sprockets 41. On the return run the moulds 23 travel over a mould support 40. The conveyer chains 18 have guide rollers 145, Fig. 8, which run on tracks 144. The moulds are attached to the conveyer by fingers 148 which project therefrom and enter recesses in the moulds in which they are retained by spring clips 149. The moulds are conveniently rectangular but may be circular or polygonal or otherwise shaped. The motive power for the machine is supplied by a motor 186, Fig. 1, which drives a shaft 191 through a chain 189 and a shaft 209 is in turn chaindriven from the shaft 191. The shaft 20 is driven from the shaft 209 through geneva gearing 254, 257 and the conveyer therefore moves in steps, bringing the moulds to rest under paper sheet feeders 25, one for each line of moulds, then under the material depositing means 27, the tamping device 29 and the transfer mechanism 33. The rotors 243 of the paper sheet feeders are driven from the shaft 209 and the continuous rotation of the rotors 243 deposite paper dividers or sheets in the moulds at definite time intervals when the moulds are at rest. The sheets may have tabs. Feeding material. Hot cheese in a hopper is kept flowable by an agitator 67. Below the hopper are three-way valves, one valve for each line of moulds. Each valve core 71, Fig. 4, is rotatable in a valve housing 70 from a rocker arm 100. Valves 86 are also operated from the rocker arm 100. The shaft 209, Fig. 1, rotates an eccentric to cause a rocker arm 218 to reciprocate a rod 223. The rod 223 is connected through a lost motion adjusting screw 226 to an arm 83 pivoted at its lower end by a pin 229 and rotation of the shaft 209 therefore causes oscillation of the arm 83, the upper end of which carries a pin 82, Fig. 4, which fits under a yoke 80, fitted with an adjusting screw 81, on the end of a piston rod 79. By these means a piston 77 is operated to fill and discharge cheese through the valves 70. The rocker arm 100 is operated from the shaft 209 to alter the positions of the valve cores 71 and in one position hot cheese is drawn through the passages in the cylinder of the piston 77 which is then retracted to cause suction. Each valve core 71 is moved by the rocker arm 100 to present a channel and the pivoted arm 83 is operated to advance the piston 77 and force the definite quantity of cheese, drawn from the hopper just previously, through the valves 86 into the moulds temporarily at rest below. The valves 86 then close to prevent cheese from dripping on the conveyer when it advances the moulds in its next motion step. The adjusting screw 226 gives coarse regulation and the adjusting screw 81 fine regulation to the quantities of cheese dispensed. Cooling. After being filled with material the moulds run over plates 143, Fig. 8, which are hollow for the circulation of coolant entering at 151 and leaving at 157, preferably so arranged that the flow of the coolant is in the opposite direction to the movement of the moulds. These cooling plates may be in sections, each with its own inlet and outlet, Fig. 1, which shows that they may be disposed to cool the moulds before they come underneath the hopper 27. After the material has been tamped in the moulds they pass through a chill tunnel 32. This comprises, Fig. 7, three chambers 133, 141 and 139, the moulds being conveyed through the middle chamber 141. Air is circulated by a blower 137 which draws air from the chamber 133, where it has been chilled by contact with the hollow cooling plates 143, through a conduit 134 in which is a filter 135 accessible by a door 136, and sends air through a conduit 138 into the upper, or pressure, chamber 139. The walls between the chambers are perforated at 140, 142 for air circulation. Tamping. Associated with each mould in a transverse row is a tamper head 119 each of which, Fig. 6, comprises a housing 122 in which fits a tamper 123 at the bottom of a rod 115. The outer wall of the housing 122 is tapered at 124 and fits a taper 127 in the wall of the corresponding mould 23, which has breather openings 125, 130. The rods 115 are attached at their upper ends to a beam 114 and they are fitted with adjustment collars 117 above which are springs bearing on the bottom of the beam 114 and below which are springs 120 bearing on the tops of the tamper housings 122. Cams 200, mounted on the shaft 191, Fig. 1, act on vertical guide rods 113 which are attached to the beam 114. The cams 200 bring the tampers down on the material on the moulds and they are raised again by springs 204. The tapering of the walls of the tamper housing 122 and mould 23 centres the tamper and at the end of its movement the bottom edges of the tamper housing walls abut a shelf 128 and close the mould space. The beam 114 continues to descend, as allowed by the springs 118 Fig. 5, (not shown) 120, and the tamper 123 forces air downwards, against the cheese, which escapes through the breather openings 125, until it reaches the position in Fig. 6 where the bottom of the plunger flattens the cheese. The springs 118 are stonger than the springs 120 and function to prevent damage if the beam 114 descends too far. The inside wall edge of the housing 122 overlaps the edge of the cheese slab and holds it down while the tamper is subsequently raised. Delivery of products. Also associated with each mould in a transverse row, Fig. 10, is a transfer unit, comprising a vacuum plate housing 170 connected by a hollow rod 169 to a housing 168 from which a hose 173 extends to a vacuum line 174. The transfer units are supported on a plate 167 which extends between two sleeves 159, one on each side of the machine, which are slidable on rods 158: Elevating rods 153 support the rods 158 through adjusting tees 156. The sleeves 159 are linked by connecting rods 160 with rocker arms 164 fixed to a shaft 165. The face of the housing 170 has a central recess 178,,Fig. 12, round which are openings 179 communicating, through screens 183, with a chamber 182 which communicates with the hollow rod 169. A shaft 279 is driven through a combination of chain and shaft drive, with bevel gearing, from a shaft 191 and carries a cam 283 which causes the rocker arms 164 to oscillate, thereby reciprocating the transfer mechanism horizontally. The elevating rods 153 are connected at the bottom to a bar 296, and the transfer mechanism is recriprocated vertically by a cam 287 on the shaft 279, through linkage 289, 293. A third cam 301 on the shaft 279 actuates a rocker arm 303 to operate an air valve 175 in the vacuum line 174. As the shaft 279 rotates the vacuum plate housings 170 are lowered into the moulds, a vacuum is applied to the chambers 182, the moulded cheese slabs in a row are sucked on the faces 171 (the screens 183 preventing cheese from being drawn into the conduits), the transfer mechanism withdraws the vacuum plate housings carrying the cheese slabs and associated paper dividing sheets, moves them horizontally over a delivery belt 49, releases the vacuum to drop the products on the belt, and returns to its original position. The recess 178 forms a trap for air which aids the release of the cheese slab, this being further expedited by breather openings 130 in the bottom of the mould. A retainer bar 180, Fig. 2, retains the moulds so that they do not also leave the conveyer. The motor 58 which drives the belt 49 is controlled by a switch 315, Fig. 2, which is only closed to operate the motor when a cam 314 registers with it. This cam 314 is driven from the shaft 279 and the arrangement is such that the switch 315 is closed after eight cheese slabs have been stacked and remains closed long enough for the motor 58 to drive the delivery belt far enough to leave space for a new stack.",SWIFT & CO,MEULEMANS BENEDICT E;;PAULY WILLIAM H,,https://lens.org/075-694-455-157-881,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,A01J27/04,A01J27/04,B5A AJ2           AJ2;;B5A A1R106X       AJ2;;B5A A1S           AJ2;;B5A A2A1          AJ2;;B5A A2A2          AJ2;;B5A A2A3          AJ2;;B5A A2B2          AJ2;;B5A A2D1X         AJ2;;B5A A2E10         AJ2;;B5A A2E3          AJ2;;B5A A2E7B         AJ2;;B5A A2E8          AJ2;;B5A A2R           AJ2;;B5A A20T1         AJ2;;B8C C10B1A        1T;;B8C C10B1B        1T;;B8C C10B1D1       1T;;B8C C10B1D2B      1T;;B8C C10C          1T;;B8C C9            1T,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Coating. ANCHOR POST PRODUCTS, Inc. 13 Oct., 1967 [2 Dec., 1966], No. 46876/67. Heading B2K. [[Also in Division D1] Metal articles e.g. wire are coated by continuously applying a pulverulent, flowing material in an unaerated compacted condition to the surface of the moving article and fusing the pulverulent material. Fig. 1B is a downward continuative of Fig. 1A. A wire W which has been cleaned of scale and grease by solvents pickling, or grit blasting is passed through a primer coating chamber 14 through which primer is passed by a pump 26. The primer is dried and cured in a tube 10 through which air from a blower 28 passes. The tube is heated by an induction coil 16 or by radiant, convertion or resistance heating. The wire then passes to a coating section 40 comprising a hopper 42 and an H-shaped coatercirculator 44. The arm 43 of the circulator 44 depends from the lowermost end of the hopper 42. The arm 45 of the circulator 44 extends to near the top of the hopper 42. Coating powder is introduced from time to time to hopper 42 through its cover 41. Recirculation of the powder is accomplished by air introduced at valved inlet 60 from blower 28. Another valved inlet 66 extends coaxially upward into the arm 45. A small portion of air is provided at an inlet 55 to prevent powder from entering the seal 52. From the arm 45 the powder and the air mixture enters the hopper 42 where separation takes place, the air escaping through an opening 72 and the powder filling the arm 43. The powder is compacted therein by electrically operated vibrators 100. Heat is removed from the coated wire by a long vertical travel. Steel wire may be coated with vinyl thermo plastic resin using a primer of thermosetting material in solvent and containing metal pigments higher in the electro motive series than iron. Steel wire may be coated with polyolefin thermoplastic such as polyethylene or polypropylene containing metal in flake or powdered form, metal oxide, hydroxides, metal carboxyl groups and including heat and ultra-violet stabilizers as well as pigments. The primer is a weak acid solution of a base metal higher in the electromotive series than iron. In the coating of steel wire with thermosetting material such as epoxy-polyamide containing pigments and stabilizers, the primer is a phosphate treatment. The articles to be coated may be any metal strip or web, filaments in other forms than wire such as flat coil, and tubing. The powder may also be maintained in a circulating condition by the use of a vacuum lift, mechanical life such as a screw conveyer or similar powder lifting device.",ANCHOR POST PROD,CASE JOHN SAMUEL;;JOHNSON WILLIAM BENEDICT,,https://lens.org/135-445-751-402-025,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,3,0,B05D7/20;;B05D3/0281;;B05D7/546;;B05D2451/00;;B05D7/20;;B05D7/546;;B05D2451/00;;B05D3/0281,B05D7/20,B2E EBB;;B2E E179;;B2E E19Y;;B2E E192;;B2E E193;;B2E E197;;B2E E20Y;;B2E E228;;B2E E248;;B2E E258;;B2E E259;;B2E E339;;B2E E349;;B2E E38Y;;B2E E380;;B2E E40Y;;B2E E41Y;;B2E E420;;B2E E44Y;;B2E E446;;B2E E457;;B2E E466;;B2E E498;;B2E E518;;B2E E532;;B2E E580;;B2E E59Y;;B2E E590;;B2E E61Y;;B2E E62X;;B2E E62Y;;B2E E630;;B2E E648;;B2E E65Y;;B2E E656;;B2E E657;;B2E E676;;B2E E70Y;;B2E E706;;B2E E707;;B2E E728;;B2L LA            LA10;;B2L LCDA          LCDA;;B2L L122          LA10;;B2L L123          LA10;;B2L L124          LA10;;B2L L135          LA10;;D1L L20X          L20X,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A low data rate wireless channel (control channel) is associated with a high speed broadcast mode wireless channel (data channel). The data channel is divided into discrete code or time slots (access slots), that are unassigned to any particular recipient or user until requested. In the event that a particular user requires a particular resource, access slots are requested through the control channel, allocated to the user, and allocation information is passed back to the requesting user through the control channel. By diverting setup and control traffic to a low-bandwidth, always-on quasi real-time control channel, capacity on the data channel can be freed up to enable the high-speed data channel to be dedicated to transmission of high-bandwidth traffic. Thus, scarce high-bandwidth resources can be utilized to the full extent to reduce the probability of time slots not being utilized due to scheduling conflicts and without requiring transmissions to stop to perform housekeeping functions between transmissions.

The circulatory assist device includes a valveless pump with a flexible bladder, a pneumatic driver for applying pressure pulses to the bladder, and a single flexible conduit for conveying blood between the patient and the pump. In use the pump and driver are mounted external to the patient's body and the flexible conduit is connected to the pump and in end-to-side relationship with a major blood vessel on that side of the heart, either right or left, which is in need of support. The circulatory assist device is operable either synchronously with the patient's heartbeat wherein the pump bladder fills as the heart ejects, then ejects in response to a pressure pulse from the driver while the heart is at rest, or asynchronously at a fixed rate if an irregular heartbeat of the patient precludes synchronous operation. The device, which can support up to about half of the workload of the heart, is easy to implant and remove and may be used to assist blood circulation in children as well as adults.",THERMO ELECTRON CORP,DALY BENEDICT D;;POIRIER VICTOR L;;ROBINSON WILLIAM J,FUEL DYNAMICS (1996-03-08);;THERMEDICS INC (1984-07-11);;THERMO ELECTRON CORPORATION (1980-09-04),https://lens.org/126-858-019-960-930,Granted Patent,yes,10,75,1,1,0,Y10S128/03;;A61M60/274;;A61M60/148;;A61M60/427;;A61M60/104;;A61M60/859;;A61M60/837;;Y10S128/03;;A61M60/148;;A61M60/274;;A61M60/104;;A61M60/427;;A61M60/859;;A61M60/837,A61M60/104;;A61M60/268;;A61M60/427;;A61M60/837;;A61M60/859,128001000D,2,1,096-846-073-832-089,967076,"""Assisted Circulation I.

Typically the junction intersects a top surface of the body. A patterned dielectric layer is formed on the surface so as to cover at least those regions of the surface that are intersected by the junction. An electrode is formed in an opening in the dielectric layer so as to make electrical contact with one side of the junction. Importantly, the thickness of the dielectric layer is sufficient to reduce the leakage current through it to less than about 1 nA when the operating voltage is in the range of about 20-100 V. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the thickness of the dielectric layer is greater than about 2 m when the applied voltage is in excess of about 20 V.

   A non-hermetic APD for operation in a moisture-containing ambient comprises an InP/InGaAsP-containing Group III-V compound semiconductor body and a p-n junction formed in the body. Typically the junction intersects a top surface of the body. A patterned dielectric layer is formed on the surface so as to cover at least those regions of the surface that are intersected by the junction. An electrode is formed in an opening in the dielectric layer so as to make electrical contact with one side of the junction. Importantly, the thickness of the dielectric layer is sufficient to reduce the leakage current through it to less than about 1 nA when the operating voltage is in the range of about 20-100 V. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the thickness of the dielectric layer is greater than about 2 m when the applied voltage is in excess of about 20 V. Moreover, the composition of dielectric layer may be either inorganic (e.g., a silicon nitride) or a combination of inorganic and organic materials.

Such lasers can advantageously be used in a variety of applications, e.g., in optical fiber telecommunications, and in compact disc players. Such ""non-hermetic"" lasers comprise facet coatings (e.g., 401, 41) that comprise a dielectric layer (e.g., 401, 41) that has very low water saturation value. In preferred embodiments this dielectric layer is SiO x  (1 Z x < 2), deposited by a molecular beam method. Deposition conditions are selected to result in a dense material that is largely free of particulates and blisters, and is substantially impermeable to moisture.

Such ""non-hermetic"" lasers comprise facet coatings (e.g., 401, 41) that comprise a dielectric layer (e.g., 401, 41) that has very low water saturation value. In preferred embodiments this dielectric layer is SiO x  (1 Z x < 2), deposited by a molecular beam method. Deposition conditions are selected to result in a dense material that is largely free of particulates and blisters, and is substantially impermeable to moisture. Among the deposition conditions is substantially normal beam incidence, and a relatively low deposition rate. Deposition is advantageously carried out under relatively high vacuum conditions. A quantitative method of determining the water level in a SiO x  film is disclosed.
