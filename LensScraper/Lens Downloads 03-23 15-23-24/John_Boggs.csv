The multiplexor includes transfer means to perform this function. Collision detecting means is also provided in the multiplexor in order to determine the simultaneous occurrence of transmission between two or more client hosts and provide a collision signal to interrupt transmission from the involved client hosts. This collision detection supplements conventional collision detection at the transceiver capable of detecting transmission collisions when two or more transceivers are attempting communication on the medium but would not be capable of detecting collisions of transmitted data signals among two or more such clustered client hosts. A collision among clustered hosts connected to the multiplexor is determined from differences in data signals transmitted by two or more client hosts.,XEROX CORP,BOGGS DAVID R;;SHOCH JOHN F,XEROX CORPORATION A CORP.

   Embodiments of substrate in accordance with the present invention provide interconnect cavities for direct interconnection between SMT components and internal conductive inner layers, as well as surface outer layers. Interconnect cavities eliminate the need for through hole vias and require less substrate surface area and internal volume. Each interconnect cavity comprises a cavity extending from the substrate surface to an adjacent internal conductive inner layer directly beneath the cavity. The cavity extends through a conductive outer layer on the substrate surface. The cavity has a conductive liner interconnected with the outer layer and the inner layer forming a cup-shaped conductive depression interconnecting the outer layer with the inner layer.

SOLUTION: A controller determines that an engine 20 is necessary and then checks the current 'engine operation' state. If the engine 20 is out of running at that time, the controller proceeds to start the engine by commanding a generator to rotate or 'motoring' the engine. The controller 36 then starts the feed of fuel and ignition thin the engine to create combustion. Measuring devices are then used to determine an ion current/discharge voltage across an ignition gap in the engine.

   An apparatus and fire protection system for detecting and extinguishing a spark, flame, or fire on a heat sensitive explosive object, which identifies, locates and relays vital information related to the particular endangered explosive object. The invention can be used to protect any heat sensitive object from thermal damage, explosive or not. Thermal energy activates a power supply, which powers the system, including a plurality of status sensor circuits that determine the status of the source of thermal energy. Each source of thermal energy is individually encoded to relay traits specific to the particular hazardous item, such as cook-off rate, type of energetic material and detonation temperature. Ultimately, all the information from the plurality of circuits and the EEPROM is relayed to personnel via the main system status display board. This permits personnel to become aware of a potential threat and monitor efforts to subdue the threat.

   The present invention provides a method and system for determining engine on status in a Hybrid Electric Vehicle. A controller determines the engine is necessary and then checks the current engine on status. If the engine is not currently running, the controller proceeds to start the engine by commanding the generator to spin or motor the engine. The controller then starts fuel flow and spark within the engine to create combustion. A measuring device is then used to determine the crankshaft speed. The controller receives this measurement and determines whether the measured variations in crankshaft speed exceed a calibratable threshold. If the calibratable threshold is exceeded, combustion is determined to be occurring and the engine is on. The controller then turns on the engine on status flag.

A controller determines the engine is necessary and then checks the current ""engine on"" status. If the engine is not currently running, the controller proceeds to start the engine by commanding the generator to spin or ""motor"" the engine. The controller then starts fuel flow and spark within the engine to create combustion. A measuring device is then used to determine the crankshaft speed. The controller receives this measurement and determines whether the measured variations in crankshaft speed exceed a calibratable threshold. If the calibratable threshold is exceeded, combustion is determined to be occurring and the engine is on.

To cause combustion, the controller 36 starts fuel supply and ignition in the engine. Measurement instruments are used to judge the speed of a crankshaft. The controller 36 receives the measured values, and judges whether or not a variation in the measured values of the speed of the crankshaft exceeds a threshold allowed to be calibrated. If the variation exceeds the threshold allowed to be calibrated, it can be judged that combustion occurs and the engine 20 is operating.

    This invention relates to a hybrid electric vehicle component coolant control system and method. The coolant system has an electric pump to move coolant through a closed system including engine and motor components. Such components to be cooled can include any electric motors, power electronics, engine, and transmission. The preferred embodiment controls coolant flow to the vehicle engine and motor in a single closed loop. 

    Vehicle components have temperature sensors that send temperature signals to an electric coolant pump duty cycle control strategy. The control strategy makes a determination of a duty cycle of the electric coolant pump as a function of the temperatures of vehicle components and orders the duty cycle of the electric pump. 

    In the preferred configuration, engine temperature sensors can acquire either engine coolant temperature or engine cylinder head temperature. The preferred configuration includes a heater core in the coolant flow path connected between vehicle components and the electric coolant pump return, whereby passenger heating requests are facilitated. Several coolant flow paths among the vehicle components are possible including a parallel and series configuration. The control system can also use a rolling average filter routine connected between the temperature sensor for the motor and the control strategy to determine the average temperature of the motor.

If efferent fibers are stimulated, alone or in combination with afferent fibers, a therapeutically effective amount of electrical stimulation is applied to activate intrafusal and/or extrafusal muscle fibers, which results in an indirect activation of afferent fibers associated therewith.",SPR THERAPEUTICS INC,BENNETT MARIA E;;BOGGS JOSEPH W;;GRILL WARREN M;;CHAE JOHN,SPR THERAPEUTICS INC (2012-03-02),https://lens.org/026-074-843-629-874,Granted Patent,yes,223,0,14,144,0,A61N1/36017;;A61N1/36057;;A61N1/36021;;A61N1/36003;;A61N1/36071;;A61N1/36021;;A61N1/36003;;A61N1/36017;;A61N1/36057;;A61N1/36071,A61N1/36,,91,62,031-854-846-644-023;;083-088-894-319-483;;026-966-252-067-121;;064-462-438-312-50X;;040-504-201-616-689;;082-569-362-569-140;;069-348-019-345-246;;042-435-412-782-114;;120-387-457-272-795;;060-564-713-229-228;;074-197-063-661-161;;119-135-283-792-777;;093-995-212-603-017;;099-726-223-602-186;;029-568-872-569-638;;020-292-980-432-055;;043-623-186-086-966;;034-544-007-114-174;;032-098-841-509-370;;041-615-656-604-906;;012-690-314-942-946;;010-834-263-935-232;;102-082-283-953-397;;095-313-353-973-89X;;014-422-180-947-603;;001-533-156-090-021;;002-234-338-843-166;;023-698-406-732-482;;031-205-061-214-496;;002-023-688-063-055;;094-712-469-202-247;;012-848-373-896-721;;103-714-679-144-27X;;103-126-043-737-562;;123-270-618-727-229;;038-647-172-682-703;;127-774-821-327-743;;117-447-720-082-520;;022-412-063-424-556;;059-619-963-017-48X;;026-812-513-096-181;;164-354-394-082-630;;047-014-972-178-712;;030-060-228-072-741;;026-514-241-614-268;;037-406-776-183-24X;;004-496-411-209-640;;110-642-955-538-026;;013-566-763-057-449;;039-631-911-114-436;;119-257-037-299-683;;005-699-165-068-26X;;006-866-549-314-10X;;026-771-567-040-468;;133-575-042-650-555;;022-500-152-941-766;;004-035-995-086-135;;044-908-580-533-248;;026-305-989-748-636;;050-848-945-013-399;;020-414-359-971-475;;054-113-502-301-293,10.1007/978-3-642-68264-3_25;;17943669;;17185637;;10.1161/01.str.0000254598.16739.4e;;16711659;;10.3171/foc.2006.20.5.3;;11481947;;4357242;;10.3171/jns.1973.39.6.0718;;16180594;;10.1191/0269215505cr901oa;;14472486;;10.1093/brain/85.2.331;;10.1126/science.150.3699.971;;5320816;;14474974;;10.1007/bf02364479;;7224246;;10.3171/jns.1979.51.6.0872;;159347;;1081187;;10.2106/00004623-198264010-00001;;6976348;;2052378;;10.1016/0304-3959(91)90125-h;;1080894;;1080893;;10.1159/000102446;;309314;;10.1191/0269215505cr941oa;;16719027;;18020078;;10.1177/0310057x0703500418;;3977577;;10.1191/0269215504cr759oa;;15180118;;12735538;;10.1191/0269215503cr612oa;;20230450;;10.1111/j.1533-2500.2009.00351.x;;10.1046/j.1525-1403.2002.02027.x;;22150814;;17299744;;10.1002/mus.20758;;10.1161/01.str.31.10.2396;;11022070;;10.1191/026921500668239146;;10688341;;11251396;;10.1159/000056465;;12017515;;10.1191/0269215502cr491oa;;3942479;;7730924;;10.1016/0895-4356(94)00170-u;;1130249;;8902421;;10.3109/09638289609166035;;0001593914;;10.1097/00005650-199206000-00002;;1593914;;10.1046/j.1365-2702.2003.00815.x;;15086636;;10.5014/ajot.50.3.194;;8822242;;11387579;;10.1053/apmr.2001.23310;;11239281;;10.1053/apmr.2001.18666;;10.1080/10790268.2001.11753565;;11587417;;15129391;;10.1016/j.apmr.2003.07.015;;10.1016/0094-114x(77)90037-4;;17086382;;10.1007/s10067-006-0464-2;;10.1191/0269215500cr339oa;;10945421;;4269119;;3874146;;10.1109/tbme.1985.325461;;10.1007/bf02363440;;7294457;;10.1097/00003086-197601000-00041;;1083324;;10.1109/emb-m.1983.5005952;;10.1109/tbme.1980.326738;;7390527;;7295933;;10.1161/01.str.29.5.975;;9596245;;1238358;;10.1109/tbme.1975.324516;;2059138;;3741075;;10.1097/aln.0b013e3181a59891;;19417603;;pmc486452;;10.1136/jnnp.61.1.30;;8676154;;10.1007/bf02648127;;9395047;;10.1007/bf02684137;;10.1161/01.str.0000180432.73724.ad;;16120847;;9487172;;10.1136/bmj.316.7128.354;;pmc2665551;;7275134;;10.1109/tbme.1981.324740;;10.1016/0141-5425(81)90003-0;;6894472,"Krainick et al, Spinal Cord Stimulation in Postamputation Pain, Surg Neural, 4 (1), pp. 167-170, Jul. 1975.;;Knutson et al., Electrode fracture rates and occurrences of infection and granulorna associated with precutaneous . . .

If efferent fibers are stimulated, alone or in combination with afferent fibers, a therapeutically effective amount of electrical stimulation is applied to activate intrafusal and/or extrafusal muscle fibers, which results in an indirect activation of afferent fibers associated therewith.",SPR THERAPEUTICS INC,BENNETT MARIA E;;BOGGS JOSEPH W;;GRILL WARREN M;;CHAE JOHN,SPR THERAPEUTICS INC (2012-03-02),https://lens.org/141-167-246-355-176,Granted Patent,yes,222,0,14,144,0,A61N1/36017;;A61N1/36057;;A61N1/36021;;A61N1/36003;;A61N1/36071;;A61N1/36021;;A61N1/36003;;A61N1/36017;;A61N1/36057;;A61N1/36071,A61N1/36,,95,64,164-354-394-082-630;;047-014-972-178-712;;020-414-359-971-475;;030-060-228-072-741;;054-113-502-301-293;;026-514-241-614-268;;037-406-776-183-24X;;004-496-411-209-640;;110-642-955-538-026;;013-566-763-057-449;;039-631-911-114-436;;119-257-037-299-683;;005-699-165-068-26X;;006-866-549-314-10X;;026-771-567-040-468;;133-575-042-650-555;;022-500-152-941-766;;004-035-995-086-135;;044-908-580-533-248;;026-305-989-748-636;;050-848-945-013-399;;031-854-846-644-023;;083-088-894-319-483;;026-966-252-067-121;;064-462-438-312-50X;;040-504-201-616-689;;082-569-362-569-140;;069-348-019-345-246;;042-435-412-782-114;;120-387-457-272-795;;060-564-713-229-228;;074-197-063-661-161;;119-135-283-792-777;;093-995-212-603-017;;099-726-223-602-186;;029-568-872-569-638;;020-292-980-432-055;;043-623-186-086-966;;034-544-007-114-174;;032-098-841-509-370;;041-615-656-604-906;;012-690-314-942-946;;010-834-263-935-232;;102-082-283-953-397;;095-313-353-973-89X;;014-422-180-947-603;;001-533-156-090-021;;002-234-338-843-166;;023-698-406-732-482;;031-205-061-214-496;;002-023-688-063-055;;094-712-469-202-247;;012-848-373-896-721;;103-714-679-144-27X;;103-126-043-737-562;;123-270-618-727-229;;038-647-172-682-703;;127-774-821-327-743;;117-447-720-082-520;;022-412-063-424-556;;059-619-963-017-48X;;026-812-513-096-181;;020-414-359-971-475;;054-113-502-301-293,10.1016/0094-114x(77)90037-4;;17086382;;10.1007/s10067-006-0464-2;;7275134;;10.1109/tbme.1981.324740;;10.1191/0269215500cr339oa;;10945421;;10.1016/0141-5425(81)90003-0;;6894472;;4269119;;3874146;;10.1109/tbme.1985.325461;;10.1007/bf02363440;;7294457;;10.1097/00003086-197601000-00041;;1083324;;10.1109/emb-m.1983.5005952;;10.1109/tbme.1980.326738;;7390527;;7295933;;10.1161/01.str.29.5.975;;9596245;;1238358;;10.1109/tbme.1975.324516;;2059138;;3741075;;10.1097/aln.0b013e3181a59891;;19417603;;pmc486452;;10.1136/jnnp.61.1.30;;8676154;;10.1007/bf02648127;;9395047;;10.1007/bf02684137;;10.1161/01.str.0000180432.73724.ad;;16120847;;9487172;;10.1136/bmj.316.7128.354;;pmc2665551;;10.1007/978-3-642-68264-3_25;;17943669;;17185637;;10.1161/01.str.0000254598.16739.4e;;16711659;;10.3171/foc.2006.20.5.3;;11481947;;4357242;;10.3171/jns.1973.39.6.0718;;16180594;;10.1191/0269215505cr901oa;;14472486;;10.1093/brain/85.2.331;;10.1126/science.150.3699.971;;5320816;;14474974;;10.1007/bf02364479;;7224246;;10.3171/jns.1979.51.6.0872;;159347;;1081187;;10.2106/00004623-198264010-00001;;6976348;;2052378;;10.1016/0304-3959(91)90125-h;;1080894;;1080893;;10.1159/000102446;;309314;;10.1191/0269215505cr941oa;;16719027;;18020078;;10.1177/0310057x0703500418;;3977577;;10.1191/0269215504cr759oa;;15180118;;12735538;;10.1191/0269215503cr612oa;;20230450;;10.1111/j.1533-2500.2009.00351.x;;10.1046/j.1525-1403.2002.02027.x;;22150814;;17299744;;10.1002/mus.20758;;10.1161/01.str.31.10.2396;;11022070;;10.1191/026921500668239146;;10688341;;11251396;;10.1159/000056465;;12017515;;10.1191/0269215502cr491oa;;3942479;;7730924;;10.1016/0895-4356(94)00170-u;;1130249;;8902421;;10.3109/09638289609166035;;0001593914;;10.1097/00005650-199206000-00002;;1593914;;10.1046/j.1365-2702.2003.00815.x;;15086636;;10.5014/ajot.50.3.194;;8822242;;11387579;;10.1053/apmr.2001.23310;;11239281;;10.1053/apmr.2001.18666;;10.1080/10790268.2001.11753565;;11587417;;15129391;;10.1016/j.apmr.2003.07.015;;7275134;;10.1109/tbme.1981.324740;;10.1016/0141-5425(81)90003-0;;6894472,"International Search Report for PCT/US12/53952 dated Nov. 15, 2012.;;European Patent Office, Extended European Search Report for Application 13760774.3, PCT/US2013/032627, dated Jan. 5, 2016, 11 pgs., European Patent Office, Germany.;;Paeslack et al., “Design and Control of a Manipulator for Tetraplegics”, Mechanism & Machine Theory, 1977, vol. 12, No. 5, pp. 413-423.;;International Search Report and Written Opinion dated Feb. 3, 2010 in International Application Serial No. PCT/US2009/006414.;;International Search Report and Written Opinion; PCT/US09/06403; dated Feb. 23, 2010.;;Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), International Search Report and Written Opinion for Application PCT/US2011/062857 filed Dec. 1, 2011, dated Mar. 9, 2012, International Search Authority, US.;;“Long Head of the Biceps Tendon Pain: Differential Diagnosis and Treatment” by Krupp et al.

If efferent fibers are stimulated, alone or in combination with afferent fibers, a therapeutically effective amount of electrical stimulation is applied to activate intrafusal and/or extrafusal muscle fibers, which results in an indirect activation of afferent fibers associated therewith.",SPR THERAPEUTICS INC,BENNETT MARIA E;;BOGGS JOSEPH W;;GRILL WARREN M;;CHAE JOHN,SPR THERAPEUTICS INC (2012-03-02),https://lens.org/098-468-183-033-357,Granted Patent,yes,220,3,14,144,0,A61N1/36017;;A61N1/36057;;A61N1/36021;;A61N1/36003;;A61N1/36071;;A61N1/36021;;A61N1/36003;;A61N1/36017;;A61N1/36057;;A61N1/36071,A61N1/36,,105,72,103-714-679-144-27X;;123-270-618-727-229;;125-124-036-583-015;;030-922-671-627-154;;011-997-506-649-664;;012-848-373-896-721;;094-712-469-202-247;;002-023-688-063-055;;071-803-591-185-224;;100-354-415-996-06X;;007-478-354-263-930;;031-205-061-214-496;;005-002-820-256-273;;023-698-406-732-482;;038-647-172-682-703;;127-774-821-327-743;;117-447-720-082-520;;022-412-063-424-556;;011-891-392-177-236;;059-619-963-017-48X;;050-646-898-795-053;;089-930-183-219-443;;021-642-812-899-514;;026-812-513-096-181;;040-195-511-922-503;;032-098-841-509-370;;050-753-834-002-951;;164-354-394-082-630;;047-014-972-178-712;;020-414-359-971-475;;054-113-502-301-293;;026-514-241-614-268;;037-406-776-183-24X;;004-496-411-209-640;;110-642-955-538-026;;013-566-763-057-449;;039-631-911-114-436;;119-257-037-299-683;;050-848-945-013-399;;005-699-165-068-26X;;006-866-549-314-10X;;026-771-567-040-468;;133-575-042-650-555;;022-500-152-941-766;;004-035-995-086-135;;044-908-580-533-248;;026-305-989-748-636;;031-854-846-644-023;;002-234-338-843-166;;001-533-156-090-021;;014-422-180-947-603;;095-313-353-973-89X;;102-082-283-953-397;;010-834-263-935-232;;012-690-314-942-946;;041-615-656-604-906;;083-088-894-319-483;;034-544-007-114-174;;043-623-186-086-966;;020-292-980-432-055;;029-568-872-569-638;;099-726-223-602-186;;093-995-212-603-017;;119-135-283-792-777;;074-197-063-661-161;;060-564-713-229-228;;026-966-252-067-121;;064-462-438-312-50X;;042-435-412-782-114;;069-348-019-345-246;;082-569-362-569-140;;040-504-201-616-689,1130249;;0001593914;;10.1097/00005650-199206000-00002;;1593914;;10.1016/0013-4694(74)90077-7;;4140077;;16719026;;10.1191/0269215506cr944oa;;4441266;;7730924;;10.1016/0895-4356(94)00170-u;;3942479;;12017515;;10.1191/0269215502cr491oa;;6688284;;10.1007/bf02478489;;10.3171/jns.1980.52.3.0346;;6153710;;10.1109/10.32109;;2787284;;11251396;;10.1159/000056465;;10.1002/nau.20544;;pmc3646571;;18092334;;10.1191/026921500668239146;;10688341;;10.1046/j.1365-2702.2003.00815.x;;15086636;;10.5014/ajot.50.3.194;;8822242;;11387579;;10.1053/apmr.2001.23310;;11239281;;10.1053/apmr.2001.18666;;10.1016/b978-0-08-029350-9.50009-8;;10.1080/10790268.2001.11753565;;11587417;;10.1302/0301-620x.70b1.3257494;;3257494;;16244520;;10.1097/01.phm.0000184154.01880.72;;10.1016/s0003-9993(99)90146-6;;10084443;;15129391;;10.1016/j.apmr.2003.07.015;;10.1053/eujp.2000.0192;;10985876;;10.1191/0269215505cr941oa;;16719027;;12413435;;10.1016/s1090-3801(02)00055-1;;10.1016/0094-114x(77)90037-4;;17086382;;10.1007/s10067-006-0464-2;;7275134;;10.1109/tbme.1981.324740;;10.1016/0141-5425(81)90003-0;;6894472;;4269119;;3874146;;10.1109/tbme.1985.325461;;10.1007/bf02363440;;7294457;;10.1097/00003086-197601000-00041;;1083324;;10.1109/emb-m.1983.5005952;;10.1109/tbme.1980.326738;;7390527;;7295933;;9487172;;10.1136/bmj.316.7128.354;;pmc2665551;;10.1161/01.str.29.5.975;;9596245;;1238358;;10.1109/tbme.1975.324516;;2059138;;3741075;;10.1097/aln.0b013e3181a59891;;19417603;;pmc486452;;10.1136/jnnp.61.1.30;;8676154;;10.1007/bf02648127;;9395047;;10.1007/bf02684137;;10.1161/01.str.0000180432.73724.ad;;16120847;;10.1007/978-3-642-68264-3_25;;10.1161/01.str.31.10.2396;;11022070;;17299744;;10.1002/mus.20758;;10.1046/j.1525-1403.2002.02027.x;;22150814;;20230450;;10.1111/j.1533-2500.2009.00351.x;;12735538;;10.1191/0269215503cr612oa;;10.1191/0269215504cr759oa;;15180118;;3977577;;18020078;;10.1177/0310057x0703500418;;17943669;;10.1159/000102446;;309314;;1080893;;1080894;;2052378;;10.1016/0304-3959(91)90125-h;;10.2106/00004623-198264010-00001;;6976348;;1081187;;10.3171/jns.1979.51.6.0872;;159347;;10.1007/bf02364479;;7224246;;14474974;;17185637;;10.1161/01.str.0000254598.16739.4e;;16711659;;10.3171/foc.2006.20.5.3;;14472486;;10.1093/brain/85.2.331;;16180594;;10.1191/0269215505cr901oa;;4357242;;10.3171/jns.1973.39.6.0718;;11481947,"J J Wall MD, Axillary Nerve Blocks, Am Fam Physician, vol. 11, No. 5, 135-142, May 1975.;;Hansen, “EMG Controlled Functional . . . of the Paretic Hand”, Scan.

Im Rahmen der Erfindung erfolgt eine Laststeuerung durch eine Veränderung des Schließzeitpunktes der Einlaßventile, wobei zur Verringerung der abgegebenen Last der Einlaßventilschließzeitpunkt nach spät verschoben ist. Weiterhin ist das Ansaugsystem strömungsdynamisch derart dimensioniert, daß das drehzahlabhängige Maximum bzw. die dynamische Überhöhung des Liefergrades erst bei einer Motordrehzahl erreicht wird, die oberhalb der Nenndrehzahl liegt. Durch diese Maßnahmen wird ein sparsamer Motor mit günstigen Drehmomenteigenschaften realisiert, der kostengünstig durch relativ geringfügige Modifikation auf der Basis eines konventionell betriebenen Motors der gleichen Motorenfamilie mit größerem Hubraum erstellt werden kann.

    A system for transmitting operational control messages to a plurality of remotely-disposed cable-locating transmitters uses a spare communication line associated with each transmitter to carry the control messages from unit to unit. In the case of a fiber optic cable, the control message is transferred from an incoming telephone line associated with a first cable-locating transmitter to a spare optical fiber. The control message then propagates down the fiber to the next transmitter (where this transmitter does not otherwise have accessibility to a telephone line). This transmitter converts the optical signal to an electrical signal and either uses the control message (if indeed destined for that particular transmitter), or re-converts it to optical form and sends it further along the spare fiber to the next remote cable-locating transmitter further down the line.

    A method and system to control engine shutdown for a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) is provided. Tailpipe emissions are reduced during the many engine shutdowns and subsequent restarts during the course of an HEV drive cycle, and evaporative emissions are reduced during an HEV soak (inactive) period. The engine shutdown routine can ramp off fuel injectors, control engine torque (via electronic throttle control), control engine speed, stop spark delivery by disabling the ignition system, stop purge vapor flow by closing a vapor management valve (VMV), stop exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) flow by closing an EGR valve, and flush the intake manifold of residual fuel (vapor and puddles) into the combustion chamber to be combusted chamber to be combusted. The resulting exhaust gas byproducts are then converted in the catalytic converter.

   This invention is a method and system to control engine shutdown in a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). The invention allows for reduced tailpipe emissions during the many engine shutdowns and subsequent restarts during the course of an HEV drive cycle and reduced evaporative emissions during an HEV soak (inactive) period. The engine shutdown routine can ramp off fuel injectors, control engine torque (via electronic throttle control), control engine speed, stop spark delivery by disabling the ignition system, stop purge vapor flow by closing a vapor management valve (VMV), stop exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) flow by closing an EGR valve, and flush the intake manifold of residual fuel (vapor and puddles) into the combustion chamber to be combusted. The resulting exhaust gas byproducts are then converted in the catalytic converter.

   This invention is a method and system to control engine shutdown for a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). The invention allows for reduced tailpipe emissions during the many engine shutdowns and subsequent restarts during the course of an HEV drive cycle and reduced evaporative emissions during an HEV soak (inactive) period. The engine shutdown routine can ramp off fuel injectors, control engine torque (via electronic throttle control), control engine speed, stop spark delivery by disabling the ignition system, stop purge vapor flow by closing a vapor management valve (VMV), stop exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) flow by closing an EGR valve, and flush the intake manifold of residual fuel (vapor and puddles) into the combustion chamber to be combusted. The resulting exhaust gas byproducts are then converted in the catalytic converter.

If efferent fibers are stimulated, alone or in combination with afferent fibers, a therapeutically effective amount of electrical stimulation is applied to activate intrafusal and/or extrafusal muscle fibers, which results in an indirect activation of afferent fibers associated therewith.",SPR THERAPEUTICS INC,BENNETT MARIA E;;BOGGS II JOSEPH W;;GRILL WARREN M;;CHAE JOHN,SPR THERAPEUTICS INC (2017-05-18),https://lens.org/173-468-600-420-154,Granted Patent,yes,224,0,5,144,0,A61N1/36071;;A61N1/36071;;A61N1/0551;;A61N1/0551;;A61N1/36017;;A61N1/36017;;A61N1/36021;;A61N1/36021;;A61N1/36057;;A61N1/36057,A61N1/05;;A61N1/36,,96,60,031-854-846-644-023;;083-088-894-319-483;;026-966-252-067-121;;064-462-438-312-50X;;040-504-201-616-689;;082-569-362-569-140;;069-348-019-345-246;;042-435-412-782-114;;120-387-457-272-795;;060-564-713-229-228;;074-197-063-661-161;;119-135-283-792-777;;093-995-212-603-017;;099-726-223-602-186;;029-568-872-569-638;;020-292-980-432-055;;043-623-186-086-966;;034-544-007-114-174;;032-098-841-509-370;;041-615-656-604-906;;012-690-314-942-946;;010-834-263-935-232;;102-082-283-953-397;;095-313-353-973-89X;;014-422-180-947-603;;001-533-156-090-021;;002-234-338-843-166;;023-698-406-732-482;;031-205-061-214-496;;002-023-688-063-055;;094-712-469-202-247;;012-848-373-896-721;;103-714-679-144-27X;;103-126-043-737-562;;123-270-618-727-229;;038-647-172-682-703;;127-774-821-327-743;;117-447-720-082-520;;022-412-063-424-556;;059-619-963-017-48X;;026-812-513-096-181;;164-354-394-082-630;;047-014-972-178-712;;030-060-228-072-741;;026-514-241-614-268;;037-406-776-183-24X;;004-496-411-209-640;;110-642-955-538-026;;013-566-763-057-449;;039-631-911-114-436;;119-257-037-299-683;;005-699-165-068-26X;;006-866-549-314-10X;;026-771-567-040-468;;133-575-042-650-555;;022-500-152-941-766;;004-035-995-086-135;;044-908-580-533-248;;026-305-989-748-636;;050-848-945-013-399,10.1007/978-3-642-68264-3_25;;17943669;;17185637;;10.1161/01.str.0000254598.16739.4e;;16711659;;10.3171/foc.2006.20.5.3;;11481947;;4357242;;10.3171/jns.1973.39.6.0718;;16180594;;10.1191/0269215505cr901oa;;14472486;;10.1093/brain/85.2.331;;10.1126/science.150.3699.971;;5320816;;14474974;;10.1007/bf02364479;;7224246;;10.3171/jns.1979.51.6.0872;;159347;;1081187;;10.2106/00004623-198264010-00001;;6976348;;2052378;;10.1016/0304-3959(91)90125-h;;1080894;;1080893;;10.1159/000102446;;309314;;10.1191/0269215505cr941oa;;16719027;;18020078;;10.1177/0310057x0703500418;;3977577;;10.1191/0269215504cr759oa;;15180118;;12735538;;10.1191/0269215503cr612oa;;20230450;;10.1111/j.1533-2500.2009.00351.x;;10.1046/j.1525-1403.2002.02027.x;;22150814;;17299744;;10.1002/mus.20758;;10.1161/01.str.31.10.2396;;11022070;;10.1191/026921500668239146;;10688341;;11251396;;10.1159/000056465;;12017515;;10.1191/0269215502cr491oa;;3942479;;7730924;;10.1016/0895-4356(94)00170-u;;1130249;;8902421;;10.3109/09638289609166035;;0001593914;;10.1097/00005650-199206000-00002;;1593914;;10.1046/j.1365-2702.2003.00815.x;;15086636;;10.5014/ajot.50.3.194;;8822242;;11387579;;10.1053/apmr.2001.23310;;11239281;;10.1053/apmr.2001.18666;;10.1080/10790268.2001.11753565;;11587417;;15129391;;10.1016/j.apmr.2003.07.015;;10.1016/0094-114x(77)90037-4;;17086382;;10.1007/s10067-006-0464-2;;10.1191/0269215500cr339oa;;10945421;;4269119;;3874146;;10.1109/tbme.1985.325461;;10.1007/bf02363440;;7294457;;10.1097/00003086-197601000-00041;;1083324;;10.1109/emb-m.1983.5005952;;10.1109/tbme.1980.326738;;7390527;;7295933;;10.1161/01.str.29.5.975;;9596245;;1238358;;10.1109/tbme.1975.324516;;2059138;;3741075;;10.1097/aln.0b013e3181a59891;;19417603;;pmc486452;;10.1136/jnnp.61.1.30;;8676154;;10.1007/bf02648127;;9395047;;10.1007/bf02684137;;10.1161/01.str.0000180432.73724.ad;;16120847;;9487172;;10.1136/bmj.316.7128.354;;pmc2665551,"Krainick et al, Spinal Cord Stimulation in Postamputation Pain, Surg Neural, 4 (1), pp. 167-170, Jul. 1975.;;Knutson et al., Electrode fracture rates and occurrences of infection and granulorna associated with precutaneous . . .

    A method of controlling an engine  12  during engine shutdown to reduce evaporative emissions is provided. The method includes a step  50  of shutting off a fuel pump  28  of the engine  12  . The method also includes a step  52  of burning off the fuel from a fuel rail  24  in a cylinder  18  of the engine  12  after the fuel pump  28  is shut off. During the burning off of the fuel, a duty cycle of each fuel injector  22  of engine  12  is controlled to allow the engine  12  to operate generally cyclically about a predetermined air/fuel ratio. The predetermined air/fuel ratio is preferably stoichiometric. By burning off the fuel in the fuel rail  24  after the fuel pump  28  is shut off, the fuel pressure in the fuel rail  24  is reduced. The reduced fuel pressure in the fuel rail  24  results in reduced evaporative emissions from the engine  12.

    A spherical clevis assembly constructed as a generally U-shaped member having two generally parallel opposing arms and a base. Two opposing inwardly disposed mounting members each having a spherical portion are situated in a respective aperture of the respective arm of the U-shaped member. Each such aperture has a sidewall-defined entry of a diameter less than an adjacent curvature of the spherical portion of the mounting member to thereby permit the spherical portion to ride upon the sidewall-defined entry and be movable in axes in accord with the adjacent curvature of the spherical portion. A pin member extends between the mounting members to receive connected components whose mounting aperture surrounds the pin member as conventionally accomplished. Since each end of the pin member is situated within a respective mounting member, the arc movement and subsequent multiplanar movements translate to the pin member. Because of this multiplanar movement, two component apertures can be accommodated by the pin member such that each such component can experience an independent movement pattern.

In special situations the outer wrap can be engineered with increased strength, the inner wrap with increased barrier properties and the inner and outer wraps can be made visually distinct from one another so that improper wrapping or opening is not a problem.",KIMBERLY CLARK CO,BOURNE SONYA NICHOLSON;;MCRAY NELSON;;BOGGS LAVADA CAMPBELL;;NEFF WILLIAM RALPH;;MORELL CHARLES JOHN;;VAUGHN MARSHA LOTTIE,,https://lens.org/176-247-761-641-038,Granted Patent,yes,43,24,35,40,0,A61L2/07;;A61L2/26;;A61L2202/181;;A61L2202/24;;B32B5/022;;B32B5/26;;B32B7/04;;B32B7/06;;B32B7/14;;B32B2250/05;;B32B2250/20;;B32B2262/0253;;B32B2262/0276;;B32B2262/04;;B32B2262/062;;B32B2307/31;;B32B2307/404;;B32B2307/54;;B32B2307/714;;B32B2307/7145;;B32B2307/7242;;B32B2307/7265;;B32B2439/80;;B32B2571/00;;A61B2050/314;;A61B50/30;;A61B50/33;;A61B46/10;;A61B46/40;;A61B90/92;;A61L2/06;;A61L2/206;;B32B7/05;;Y10T428/24488;;Y10T428/27;;Y10T428/24826;;B32B7/022;;Y10T428/24488;;Y10T428/27;;Y10T428/24826;;B32B2553/00;;B32B5/26;;B32B7/04;;B32B2307/54;;B32B2307/7145;;A61L2/26;;B32B5/022;;B32B2250/20;;B32B2262/0276;;B32B2439/80;;B32B2262/0253;;A61L2/07;;B32B2262/062;;B32B2307/7265;;B32B2250/05;;B32B2307/404;;B32B2307/7242;;B32B2262/04;;B32B2307/31;;B32B7/06;;B32B2307/714;;B32B2571/00;;A61L2202/24;;A61L2202/181;;B32B7/14;;A61B2050/314;;A61B50/33;;A61B46/10;;A61B90/92;;A61B50/30;;A61B46/40;;A61L2/06;;A61L2/206;;B32B7/05;;B32B7/022,B65B55/04;;A61B19/00;;A61B19/02;;A61B19/08;;A61L2/26;;B32B5/26;;B32B7/022;;B32B7/06;;B32B7/14;;B65D75/28;;B65D81/24;;D04H13/00,422/26;;422/34;;428/157;;428/340;;156/290;;206/439,1,0,,,"Jezic et al., Resealable and Radiation Sterilizable Packaging , RD 288 048 Dow Chemical Company (Mar. 20, 1988.",EXPIRED

In a particular case, the wrap (12) is prepared so as to increase strength, the wrap (14) is prepared so as to strengthen barrier performance, the wrap (14) and the wrap (12) are arranged so as to be visually distinguished from each other, and thereby improper packing and opening can be prevented. <P>COPYRIGHT: (C)2004,JPO&NCIPI",KIMBERLY CLARK CO,BOURNE SONYA NICHOLSON;;MCRAY NELSON;;BOGGS LAVADA CAMPBELL;;NEFF WILLIAM RALPH;;MORELL CHARLES JOHN;;VAUGHN MARSHA LOTTIE,,https://lens.org/062-700-216-287-52X,Patent Application,no,0,9,35,40,0,A61L2/07;;A61L2/26;;A61L2202/181;;A61L2202/24;;B32B5/022;;B32B5/26;;B32B7/04;;B32B7/06;;B32B7/14;;B32B2250/05;;B32B2250/20;;B32B2262/0253;;B32B2262/0276;;B32B2262/04;;B32B2262/062;;B32B2307/31;;B32B2307/404;;B32B2307/54;;B32B2307/714;;B32B2307/7145;;B32B2307/7242;;B32B2307/7265;;B32B2439/80;;B32B2571/00;;A61B2050/314;;A61B50/30;;A61B50/33;;A61B46/10;;A61B46/40;;A61B90/92;;A61L2/06;;A61L2/206;;B32B7/05;;Y10T428/24488;;Y10T428/27;;Y10T428/24826;;B32B7/022;;Y10T428/24488;;Y10T428/27;;Y10T428/24826;;B32B2553/00;;B32B5/26;;B32B7/04;;B32B2307/54;;B32B2307/7145;;A61L2/26;;B32B5/022;;B32B2250/20;;B32B2262/0276;;B32B2439/80;;B32B2262/0253;;A61L2/07;;B32B2262/062;;B32B2307/7265;;B32B2250/05;;B32B2307/404;;B32B2307/7242;;B32B2262/04;;B32B2307/31;;B32B7/06;;B32B2307/714;;B32B2571/00;;A61L2202/24;;A61L2202/181;;B32B7/14;;A61B2050/314;;A61B50/33;;A61B46/10;;A61B90/92;;A61B50/30;;A61B46/40;;A61L2/06;;A61L2/206;;B32B7/05;;B32B7/022,B65B55/04;;A61B19/00;;A61B19/02;;A61B19/08;;A61L2/26;;B32B5/26;;B32B7/022;;B32B7/06;;B32B7/14;;B65D75/28;;B65D81/24;;D04H13/00,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

   The bottle closure comprises a generally cylindrical inner member adapted to be threadedly engaged on the outside of the neck of a bottle. The inner member has a central passage communicating with the neck of the bottle. An outer member is rotatably mounted on and around the inner member. The inner member includes a valve seat defining a fluid passage between the bottle and the outer member and being located within the neck of the bottle. The outer member includes a valve closure element adapted to close the fluid passage in a first annular position of the outer member on the inner member thereby to form a seal with the valve seat. The outer member, when moved to a second annular position relative to the inner member, opens the fluid passage, thereby to allow fluid in a bottle to flow through the closure.

Thus, known methods for manufacture of phenol from cumene in which an oxygen-containing gas stream is passed through liquid cumene to produce an oxidate product and a spent-air stream comprising methanol and cumene and a saturating amount of water; and in which the spent-air stream is passed through one or more heat exchanger coolers and a carbon bed prior to discharge can be improved.",GEN ELECTRIC,BOGGS DAVID L;;PAUL BARKLEY;;FARRELL ANDREW H;;FULMER JOHN WILLIAM;;GEYER BRADLEY NORMAN;;KIGHT WILLIAM DALE;;WIGHT TARA H,,https://lens.org/159-202-213-784-630,Granted Patent,no,0,0,18,18,0,B01D53/002;;B01D53/04;;B01D2253/102;;B01D2257/704;;C07C39/04;;Y02P20/50;;B01D53/00;;C07C39/04;;B01D53/04;;B01D2253/102;;B01D2257/704;;B01D53/002,B01D53/04;;B01D53/44;;B01D53/74;;C07C27/12;;C07C37/08;;C07C39/04,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   In the invention, a method is provided for producing a composite nonwoven fabric. A polymer is extruded into heated continuous filaments, possibly elastic, from the die head to a first chilled roller, wherein the extruder is configured to provide the continuous filaments to the chilled roller in a canted direction that is at a tangent or angle to the surface of the first chilled roller. The filaments are conveyed in a downward direction by way of chilled rollers to a nip. In a next step, the nonwoven web is sprayed with an adhesive and is laminated on the continuous filaments in the nip to form a composite nonwoven fabric. The continuous filaments move vertically downward approximately in line with the lamination process, facilitating automatic re-threading of filaments when they are broken or interrupted in their travel downward onto the chilled rolls.
