To synchronize the distributed replications, a platform independent synchronization manager creates a file system watcher for each file system associated with a replication of the file. The file system watcher monitors each object for events affecting the object or the object's constituent files, such as creation, deletion, change and rename. Notifications are sent to the synchronization manager, which consolidates the modifications and updates a locally stored replication, if necessary. The synchronization manager then sends a notification of an update to all other synchronization managers for all replications of the distributed file or folder.

To synchronize the distributed replications, a platform independent synchronization manager creates a file system watcher for each file system associated with a replication of the file. The file system watcher monitors each object for events affecting the object or the object's constituent files, such as creation, deletion, change and rename. Notifications are sent to the synchronization manager, which consolidates the modifications and updates a locally stored replication, if necessary. The synchronization manager then sends a notification of an update to all other synchronization managers for all replications of the distributed file or folder.

Openings in the gate oxide in the vicinity of the gates to be formed place the two conductive layers in contact with each other before the gates are formed and allows for the underlying conductive layer (usually the substrate) to be exposed to the plasma as the overlying unmasked conductive layer (usually polysilicon) is etched away. Preferably, the layer to be etched is deposited to be in contact with the underlying layer at the openings.

   Wavelength stability of an optical oscillator has been enhanced by feedback from an external position-sensing detector to control the position or tilt of an intracavity optical element, such as a mirror. The wavelength stability results from stabilization of the intracavity beam position relative to an aperture in the oscillator. The wavelength selectivity of the aperture results from incorporation of a dispersive element in the oscillator cavity that produces a mapping of wavelength to beam position at the aperture.

Images are stored in forms that can be rapidly browsed and retrieved by remote client applications in a drill-down or roll-up fashion. The data can be represented and retrieved using a view element data structure that includes node elements and transition elements between nodes. The data is decomposed (in space or spatial-frequency to construct a tree-based or graph-based data structure) into view elements. A set of view elements is selected, compressed and stored without adversely impacting image view extraction or generation speed. View elements are placed into the node elements of the data structure and the transition elements indicate the processing to generate other view elements in the data structure. In a server-side view construction, the view elements are selectively retrieved from storage, decompressed, and processed to generate the views of the data. In a client-side progressive view construction, the client caches the view elements and processes them in combination with view elements retrieved from the server to generate views of the data. The data reuse at the client reduces data transmission in drill-down or roll-up browsing. Data can be ingested, read and written in units of spatial blocks and decomposed into view elements using the spatial block units. Thus, the ingestion, decomposition, compression, and view retrieval for large images can be done using computer devices that have limited storage and processing capabilities.",IBM,CASTELLI VITTORIO;;LI CHUNG-SHENG;;SMITH JOHN RICHARD,GOOGLE LLC (2011-05-03);;IBM CORPORATION (1998-05-14),https://lens.org/135-408-468-283-507,Granted Patent,yes,7,101,1,2,0,G06F16/51;;G06F16/51;;Y10S707/99942;;Y10S707/99933,G06F17/30,707/101;;707/3;;707/100;;345/419;;345/139,6,4,132-084-424-081-455;;001-824-300-434-299;;035-903-136-289-884;;154-440-327-155-586,10.1109/tcom.1983.1095851;;10.1109/18.119732;;10.1145/356924.356930;;10.1109/tassp.1986.1164962,"P.J.

Within the described mesh operating environment, each of the devices may be configured to do the same processing so that the file system view of the synchronized folder looks the same on all devices (pending local capabilities). Updates that cannot be immediately realized to the local store due to conflicts may be deferred for later attempts when, for example, additional updates at the system level or local level are made to resolve or eliminate the conflict for the update item. Generally, further changes may be propagated by a user in addressing a particular conflict that the user is notified about (e.g., via a selected winner that the user disagrees with). Alternatively, the conflict may resolve itself when a further update occurs that overrides or renders moot the previous update (e.g., a deleted item having a modified enclosure, where the enclosure had a previous concurrency conflict). Depending on the local file system, the described system and process may perform additional fix ups for file name, attributes, etc. In this case, the described system and process may be configured not to update a main replication feed since the updates are local or node application specific.

Updates that cannot be immediately realized to the local store due to conflicts may be deferred for later attempts when, for example, additional updates at the system level or local level are made to resolve or eliminate the conflict for the update item. Generally, further changes may be propagated by a user in addressing a particular conflict that the user is notified about (e.g., via a selected winner that the user disagrees with). Alternatively, the conflict may resolve itself when a further update occurs that overrides or renders moot the previous update (e.g., a deleted item having a modified enclosure, where the enclosure had a previous concurrency conflict). Depending on the local file system, the described system and process may perform additional fix ups for file name, attributes, etc. In this case, the described system and process may be configured not to update a main replication feed since the updates are local or node application specific.

Images are stored in forms that allow them to be rapidly browsed and retrieved by remote client applications in a drill-down fashion. The data can be represented and retrieved using a view element data structure that includes node elements and transition elements between nodes. The data is decomposed (in space or spatial-frequency to construct a tree-based or graph-based data structure) into view elements. A set of view elements is selected, compressed and stored without adversely impacting image view extraction or generation speed. View elements are placed into the node elements of the data structure and the transition elements indicate the processing to generate other view elements in the data structure. In a server-side view construction, the view elements are selectively retrieved from storage, decompressed, and processed to generate the views of the data. In a client-side progressive view construction, the client caches the view elements and processes them in combination with view elements retrieved from the server to generate views of the data. The data reuse at the client reduces data transmission in drill-down or roll-up browsing. Data can be ingested, read and written in units of spatial blocks and decomposed into view elements using the spatial block units. Thus, the ingestion, decomposition, compression, and view retrieval for large images can be done using computer devices that have limited storage and processing capabilities.",IBM,CASTELLI VITTORIO;;LI CHUNG-SHENG;;SMITH JOHN RICHARD,UNILOC 2017 LLC (2018-05-03);;IPG HEALTHCARE 501 LIMITED (2007-09-26);;PENDRAGON NETWORKS LLC (2012-04-10);;UNILOC LUXEMBOURG S.A (2018-01-31);;IBM CORPORATION (1998-05-14),https://lens.org/141-850-934-552-065,Granted Patent,yes,4,41,1,2,0,G06F16/29;;G06F16/29;;Y10S707/99945;;Y10S707/99942,G06F17/30,345/420;;345/139;;345/356;;345/435;;707/104;;707/101;;382/232,6,4,132-084-424-081-455;;001-824-300-434-299;;035-903-136-289-884;;154-440-327-155-586,10.1109/tcom.1983.1095851;;10.1109/18.119732;;10.1145/356924.356930;;10.1109/tassp.1986.1164962,"P.J.

The sensor has a molded plastic base mounted on a metal chassis and a metal cover welded to the chassis to sealingly enclose the base. One surface of the base acts as a guide surface for a roller. A pair of thin metal bands are wrapped around the roller. Each band is fixed at one end to the base and at the other end to a J-shaped tensioner underneath the base. The roller is rollable on the guide surface under an applied force to cause the band to engage firing contacts to complete the electrical circuits. An optical electromagnet may be fixed to the chassis without increasing the overall size of the sensor. The electromagnet is selectively operable to attract the roller to test the sensor by completing the electrical circuits. The electromagnet includes a ferromagnetic core and a coil wound directly on the core. The roller has a ferromagnetic insert formed in a dumb-bell shape, that is, having a larger cross-section at its ends than in the middle to increase the attractive force of the electromagnet without significantly increasing weight and thus inertia of the roller. The chassis and the cover may be made of a ferromagnetic material to shield the sensor from external magnetic fields.",TECHNAR TRW,RUSSELL RICHARD J;;HUNT FREDDIE E;;CHUNG FRANK K,TRW TECHNAR INC.

Disposed within the case are transverse and longitudinal rods operatively coupled to respective control knobs, one of which, when turned, causes the longitudinal rod to shift toward either side of the case, the other of which, when turned causes the transverse rod to shift to either end of the case. Supported at the intersection of the rods is an indexable stylus turret and carrier assembly whose carrier is slidably supported on the transverse rod and whose stylus turret which is received within the carrier, is slidably supported on the longitudinal rod whereby the position occupied by the assembly is determined by the point of intersection. The turret is indexable to present to the underside of the screen, for scraping powder therefrom to draw a line, any one of three styluses each producing a line of different width or character or to present a blank stylus which interrupts the drawn line. Indexing is effected by pressing an actuator bar operatively coupled to the longitudinal rod carrying the turret to depress this rod and to cause a turret pin to engage an abutment in the carrier, this action causing the turret to index to its next operative position.",BUDDY CORP L,AUER ROBERT T;;MAYER RICHARD J;;CHUNG JORE M,EMPIRE MANUFACTURING INC (1995-07-14);;BUDDY L INC.

The dynamic row buffer comprises a row buffer master register and a row buffer slave register. The row buffer master register comprises a plurality of master circuits (M1) and a plurality of slave circuits (S1). Likewise, the row buffer slave register comprises a plurality of master circuits (M2) and a plurality of slave circuits (S2). The row buffer master register is parallel load and parallel read-out with the outputs of the master register slave circuits being connected to the master circuits of the slave register. The row buffer slave register is a parallel load, serial read-out register with the output being shifted out of a secondary output port. The entire row buffer can be isolated from the memory array, and when so isolated, the memory array can be accessed through the primary input/output port in the same way as in an ordinary DRAM chip. This arrangement permits the conversion of a DRAM chip to a dual port display, of which a specific example is disclosed, or some other special function RAM thereby adding a large value to the DRAM chip with little additional cost.",IBM,CHUNG PAUL WING-SHING;;MATICK RICHARD EDWARD;;LING DANIEL TAJEN,,https://lens.org/192-648-007-689-31X,Patent Application,yes,0,11,7,7,0,G11C7/1051;;G11C7/106;;G11C7/1075;;G11C11/4093;;G11C7/106;;G11C7/1075;;G11C7/1051;;G11C11/4093,G11C11/401;;G06F12/00;;G11C7/10;;G11C11/4093,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

CONSTITUTION: An end user(UE-A)(218) transmits a signal to a network by using an interface(2) to couple two calls to a conference call. A request and corresponding parameters are transmitted to a network controller(202). When the network controller(202) receives the request, it checks a subscription database for service authentication and starts setup of network resources(224). The network controller(202) maintains previous call information such as end-codec performances and call identifications. The network controller(202) requests a conference media resource(224) and transmits an SIP INVITE to a resource controller(204). When the network conference resource(224) is allocated, the network controller(202) transmits SIP UPDATE including a transmission/reception IP address, a port number and codec information for a corresponding conference port on the network resource(224) to the UE-A(218). The network controller(202) transmits remote media end information of an SDP to the resource controller(204) so that construction of the network resource(224) can be completed.

    A method is provided for making a well-defined, highly-predictable chevron type MR sensor for a read head. A first material is selected for a first gap layer. A selected second material is deposited on the first gap layer followed by a resist frame that has elongated openings exposing elongated top portions of the first gap layer that extend at an acute angle to a head surface of the read head. A selected reactive ion etch (RIE) is employed to etch away the exposed portions of the second material layer down to the first material of the first gap layer. The material of the second material layer is chosen to be etched by the RIE while the material of the first gap layer is chosen not to be etched by the RIE. An example is Al _{ 2 } O _{ 3 } for the first gap layer, SiO _{ 2 } for the second material layer and a RIE that is fluorine based. The resist frame is removed leaving elongated strips of the second material layer extending at the aforementioned angle to the head surface. MR material is then sputtered on top of the first gap layer and on the second material strips building up a MR sensor which has a ribbed structure on each of its first and second surfaces. The resultant MR head has second material strips sandwiched between the first gap layer and the MR sensor.

It is this annular region which is in direct contact with a corresponding region of the sample cell face so as to provide self-sealing capabilities. The sensor cartridge most preferably includes a flow-through sample cell having a zig-zag or serpentine flow channel so as to provide a series of sensor ports on both of the opposed cell faces. The faces of the sample cell are most preferably provided with recessed regions which define a series of land surfaces each of which surrounds a respective one of the sensor ports. A pair of sensor arrays having a corresponding series of sensors are thus juxtaposed with a respective land surface of the sample cell face so as to sandwich the sample cell therebetween. A two-part ""clamshell"" housing houses the sensor arrays and the sample cell sandwiched therebetween.",GRUPO CH WERFEN S A;;UNIV DUKE;;UNIV NORTH CAROLINA;;UNIV CASE WESTERN RESERVE,BERGKUIST CAROLYN;;BUCK RICHARD P;;COSOFRET VASILE V;;LIU CHUNG-CHUIN;;LUCIC RICHARD A;;MORIARTY JOHN P;;NEUMAN MICHAEL R;;BUCCHIANERI RICHARD M,GRUPO CH-WERFEN S.A (1998-06-23);;DUKE UNIVERSITY (1998-06-23);;CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY (1998-06-23);;NORTH CAROLINA THE UNIVERSITY OF (1998-06-23),https://lens.org/155-548-652-065-93X,Granted Patent,yes,14,93,1,1,0,G01N33/4915;;G01N33/492;;G01N33/492;;G01N33/4915,G01N27/403;;G01N33/487;;G01N33/49,204/411;;204/409,1,0,,,"Davies et al, The Potential of Hydrogen (sic, Hydrogel) Polymers in Sensor Applications , Selective Electrode Rev. , 1991, vol. 13, pp. 159 226.",EXPIRED

Z-LBP has a lower computational complexity per iteration than variable- node-centric LBP (V-LBP), while being simpler than flooding and check-node-centric LBP (C-LBP). For QC-LDPC codes where the sub-matrices can have at most one ""1 "" per column and one ""1 "" per row, Z-LBP can perform partially-parallel decoding with the same performance as C-LBP. The decoder comprises a control circuit and memory coupled to a parity check matrix. Message passage is performed within Z- LBP in a first direction on odd iterations, and in a second direction on even iterations. As a result, a smaller parity check matrix can be utilized, while convergence can be more readily attained. The inventive method and apparatus can also be implemented for partially-parallel architectures.",UNIV CALFORNIA;;WESEL RICHARD;;CHANG MAU-CHUNG FRANK;;CHANG YUAN-MAO;;CASADO ANDRES I VILA,WESEL RICHARD;;CHANG MAU-CHUNG FRANK;;CHANG YUAN-MAO;;CASADO ANDRES I VILA,,https://lens.org/085-152-988-778-732,Search Report,yes,4,0,4,4,0,H03M13/1111;;H03M13/114;;H03M13/116;;H03M13/116;;H03M13/1111;;H03M13/114,H03M13/00;;H03M13/11,,1,1,048-376-472-346-614,10.1109/icc.2008.225,"CHANG, YUAN-MAO ET AL.: ""Lower-Complexity Layered Belief-Propagation Decoding of LDPC Codes"", IEEE'08 ICC, 19 May 2008 (2008-05-19) - 23 May 2008 (2008-05-23), pages 1155 - 1160",PENDING

Z-LBP has a lower computational complexity per iteration than variable-node-centric LBP (V-LBP), while being simpler than flooding and check-node-centric LBP (C-LBP). For QC-LDPC codes where the sub-matrices can have at most one “1” per column and one “1” per row, Z-LBP can perform partially-parallel decoding with the same performance as C-LBP. The decoder comprises a control circuit and memory coupled to a parity check matrix. Message passage is performed within Z-LBP in a first direction on odd iterations, and in a second direction on even iterations. As a result, a smaller parity check matrix can be utilized, while convergence can be more readily attained. The inventive method and apparatus can also be implemented for partially-parallel architectures.",WESEL RICHARD;;CHANG MAU-CHUNG FRANK;;CHANG YUAN-MAO;;VILA CASADO ANDRES I;;UNIV CALIFORNIA,WESEL RICHARD;;CHANG MAU-CHUNG FRANK;;CHANG YUAN-MAO;;VILA CASADO ANDRES I,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA A CALIFORNIA CORPORATION (2010-10-27),https://lens.org/097-770-986-777-06X,Granted Patent,yes,8,13,4,4,0,H03M13/1111;;H03M13/114;;H03M13/116;;H03M13/116;;H03M13/1111;;H03M13/114,H03M13/00,714/752;;714/758;;714/801,21,10,015-798-705-998-641;;080-175-873-734-043;;089-072-640-946-198;;022-354-712-780-110;;179-554-876-092-04X;;083-474-540-752-947;;029-869-316-658-110;;025-097-887-573-070;;072-153-999-809-63X;;004-549-576-017-926,10.1109/tvlsi.2003.817545;;10.1016/j.physa.2003.08.015;;10.1109/acssc.2005.1599818;;10.1109/icc.2007.158;;10.1109/eeei.2004.1361130;;10.1109/tit.1974.1055186;;10.1109/tcomm.2004.831353;;10.1109/sips.2004.1363033;;10.1109/tcomm.2005.861667;;10.1109/glocom.2002.1188425,"Yeo, R. et al.-""High Throughput Low-Density Parity-Check Decoder Architectures""-Proc. 2001 Global Conference on Communications, pp. 3019-3024, San Antonio, TX, 2001.;;Mansour, M.M. et al.-""High-Throughput LDPC Decoders""-IEEE Trans. on Very Large Scale Integration Systems, vol. 11, No. 6, Dec. 2003.;;Kfir, H. et al.-""Parallel versus sequential updating for Belief Propagation decoding""-Physica A, vol. 330, pp. 259-270, 2003.;;Zhang, J. et al.-""Shuffled Belief Propagation Decoding""-IEEE Trans. on Commun., vol. 53, pp. 1-31, Feb. 2005.;;Radosavljevic, P. et al.-""Optimized message Passing Schedules for LDPC Decoding""-Proc. 39th Asilomar Conf. on Signals, Systems and Computers, pp. 591-595, 2005.;;Vila Casado, A.I. et al.-""Informed Dynamic Scheduling for Belief-Propagation Decoding of LDPC Codes""-IEEE ICC 2007, pp. 932-937, Glasgow, Scotland, Jul. 2007.;;Robertson, P. et al.-""A Comparison of Optimal and Sub-Optimal MAP Decoding Algorithms Operating in the Log Domain""-Proc.

For QC-LDPC codes where the sub-matrices can have at most one ""1 "" per column and one ""1 "" per row, Z-LBP can perform partially-parallel decoding with the same performance as C-LBP. The decoder comprises a control circuit and memory coupled to a parity check matrix. Message passage is performed within Z- LBP in a first direction on odd iterations, and in a second direction on even iterations. As a result, a smaller parity check matrix can be utilized, while convergence can be more readily attained.
