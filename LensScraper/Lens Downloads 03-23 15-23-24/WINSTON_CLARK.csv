There is an open volume for receiving an object between the first surface and the second module. The first surface is arranged between the at least one radiation detector and the open volume. Radiation and spectroscopic data are captured by the standalone apparatus to be used for categorising the object (210).",SOLETANCHE FREYSSINET S.A.S.,"CLARK, Robert;;SMITH, Winston",,https://lens.org/023-777-236-944-997,Patent Application,yes,0,0,1,1,0,,G01V5/00;;G01T1/167,,0,0,,,,UNKNOWN

Fully extending the duct or shroud during takeoff increases lift and upward thrust, while retracting the duct or shroud and stowing the duct or shroud inside of the wing during forward cruise decreases aircraft drag and increases lift. Duct or shroud extension during takeoff also enables critical safety and noise cancellation functionality.

Fully extending the duct or shroud during takeoff increases lift and upward thrust, while retracting the duct or shroud and stowing the duct or shroud inside of the wing during forward cruise decreases aircraft drag and increases lift. Duct or shroud extension during takeoff also enables critical safety and noise cancellation functionality.

The blade outer air seal assembly is positioned radially outwardly of said radially outer tip (103) of said blade (102). The blade outer air seal (400) has forward and aft hooks (402, 404), and the forward and aft hooks (402, 404) are supported on forward and aft seal hooks (112, 114) of an attachment (110). The blade outer air seal (400) is formed of a plurality of laminates layered with a central web (406) formed of a plurality of laminate members including an inner reinforcement member, and an outer overwrap that wraps around said inner reinforcement member. The blade outer air seal (400) is formed of a plurality of laminate layers, with internal cooling circuits (408) formed in one of said layers.

Between the two areas is a loading area of combination canister for transfering the empty canisters to the place adjacent to the loading positions. Both areas are equipped with radiation detectors and ultrasonic detectors to measure the radioactivity and detect if the radioactivity is above the standard or if the waste contains any liquid. A computer is used to control the best loading capacity of waste in the canister. If it is detected that the waste contains liquid, the computer will energize the alarm circuit.
