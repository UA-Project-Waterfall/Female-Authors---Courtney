An MR-visible and/or X-ray visible drug delivery device is positioned by non-linear magnetic stereotaxis at a site such as an intracranial target site, its location is verified via MR imaging, and it is then used to deliver a biologically active material such as a diagnostic or therapeutic drug solution into that site (such as the brain) at constant or variable rates. The spatial distribution kinetics of the injected or infised drug agent may be monitored quantitatively and non-invasively using real-time MR-imaging such as water proton directional diffusion MR imaging, to establish the efficacy of targeted drug delivery.",UNIV MINNESOTA;;UNIV VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH,GILLIES GEORGE T;;KUCHARCZYK JOHN;;BROADDUS WILLIAM C;;LATCHAW RICHARD,VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY OF

It also includes an arm (20) with two rotary joints (18,40) and three pivot joints (34,36,42) that can be deployed for better access to difficult to reach locations. The manipulator (10), which is remotely operated, can be used to manipulate a variety of tools (48,90,94) to perform various service activities. The tools (48,90,94), which are attached to the end of the arm (20), include a water jet (48), a gripper (90), a cutter (94) and a camera.
