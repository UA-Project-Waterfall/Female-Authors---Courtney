The mechanism includes a bicycle fork anchor having a fork pinching assembly that has two bicycle fork prong receiving portions. A handle is operably coupled to, or associated with the fork pinching assembly for configuring the fork pinching assembly between a bicycle fork pre-pinched position and a bicycle fork pinch-secured position. Also, the handle is located between the fork prong receiving portions. Supplementarily, an adjustable mounting may be included for permitting the bicycle fork anchor to be canted to a side within a substantially horizontal plane thereby turning the handle bars of a bicycle that is secured upon the bicycle fork anchor.",THULE IND AB,NOEL JAMES R;;CHIMENTI THOMAS A;;MURRAY FREDERICK G;;JOHANSSON JAN ERIK,INDUSTRI AB THULE (1997-10-07),https://lens.org/104-877-411-186-172,Granted Patent,yes,33,30,3,3,0,B60R9/048;;B60R9/10;;B60R9/048;;B60R9/10,B60R9/048;;B60R9/10,224/315;;211/5;;211/17;;224/309;;224/324;;224/570,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The mechanism includes a pair of skewers (123) that are at least partially received within a bicycle fork anchor (100) and the skewers (123) are movable one skewer (125) relative to the other skewer (130). The pair of skewers (123) are configured for fixing a bicycle's fork to the anchor (100). Each skewer (125,130) of the pair (123) is operable between a bicycle fork pre-pinched position and a bicycle fork pinch-secured position. Each skewer (125) of the skewer pair (123) is longitudinally aligned with the other skewer pair (130) and the skewers (125,130) are spaced apart from one another in at least one of the two positions. At least one handle (110) is coupled to the bicycle fork anchor (100) for operating at least one skewer (125,130) of the skewer pair (123) between the bicycle fork pre-pinched position and the bicycle fork pinch-secured position. A single handle (110) may be located between fork prong receiving portions (136) of the skewer pair (123) so that the handle (110) operates exclusively within a space between the distal ends (129,134) of the skewer pair (123).",THULE IND AB,NOEL JAMES R;;CHIMENTI THOMAS A;;MURRAY FREDERICK G;;JOHANSSON JAN ERIK,INDUSTRI AB THULE (1997-10-07),https://lens.org/086-266-787-699-490,Granted Patent,yes,28,52,3,3,0,B60R9/048;;B60R9/10;;B60R9/048;;B60R9/10,B60R9/048;;B60R9/10,224/315;;211/5;;211/17;;224/309;;224/324;;224/570,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
