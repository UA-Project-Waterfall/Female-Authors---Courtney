Each modular timer variously provides eight on/off events, either upon five weekdays and upon two weekend days, or upon individual days. Each modular timer may skip timed events during a one to seven day period. An astronomical timer generates an on/off signal at local sunrise and sunset without reference to ambient light conditions. Each timer is readily programmed, and toggled in its on/off signal state, by pushbutton switches. A comprehensive display shows current programmed data and on/off signal status. Each modular switch typically has two pairs of relays that are oppositely controlled. Solely by external electrical connections to the terminals of these relays, and by a further internal jumper particularly in order to realize the 3PST and 4PST switching functions, the same switch circuit is used in all four custom packagings.

   A system and method for improved electronic security credentials is presented. A client sends a request to a server wherein the request includes a user's identity information. The server authenticates the user using the user's identity information, and creates an authentication credential. The server stores the user's identity information in the authentication credential in the same form as it was received. If the server determines that the request should be sent to a downstream server, the server creates a message and includes the user's identity information in the message. The continued propagation of the user's original identity information preserves the integrity of the user's identity on a server-by-server basis. Each server may map this information to a credential in a way that it chooses based upon the server's underlying authentication mechanism and mapping rules.

    An ignition system for an internal combustion engine includes an ignition coil coupled to a spark plug in a combustion chamber of the engine, and a switch responsive to an ignition control signal for causing a primary current to flow through a primary winding of the ignition coil. A control circuit is configured to generate the ignition control signal so as to produce a plurality of sparks at the spark plug during a combustion event in the cylinder. A combustion detection circuit in sensing relation with the combustion cylinder is configured to generate a combustion detect signal when combustion occurs. The control circuit is further configured to terminate the generation of the ignition control signal during the combustion event in response to the combustion detect signal, thereby terminating multicharge operation when the need for further sparks is no longer present. Unnecessary spark plug wear is avoided.

The systems and methods utilize one or more optical processing systems to generate a first set of alignment marks in a first region on a surface. The optical processing systems then move their focus to a second region on the surface. The second region generally partially overlaps the first region such that the optical processing systems can detect the location of the first set of alignment marks. The optical processing systems then generate a second set of alignment marks based on the location of the first set of alignment marks. This process is repeated in an iterative manner until alignment marks have been generated on all regions of the surface.

Techniques include fringe scanning, simultaneous fringe projections, interferometry, and x-ray imaging. The techniques can be applied to 3D printing systems to enable rapid topographical measurements of a 3D printer powder bed, or other rapidly moving, nearly continuous surface to be tested. The techniques act in parallel to the system being measured to provide information about system operation and the topography of the product being processed. A tool is provided for achieving higher precision, increasing throughput, and reducing the cost of operation through early detection and diagnosis of operating problems and printing defects. These techniques work well with any powder bed 3D printing system, providing real-time metrology of the powder bed, the most recently printed layer, or both without reducing throughput.",NIKON CORP,GOODWIN ERIC PETER;;DURKO HEATHER LYNN;;SMITH DANIEL GENE;;MARQUEZ JOHNATHAN AGUSTIN;;BINNARD MICHAEL BIRK;;CHANG PATRICK SHIH;;BJORK MATTHEW PARKER-MCCORMICK;;COON PAUL DEREK;;HERR BRETT WILLIAM;;ISHIKAWA MOTOFUSA,NIKON CORPORATION (2020-07-14),https://lens.org/012-140-803-205-895,Patent Application,yes,9,2,3,3,0,G01B11/2527;;G01B9/02097;;B33Y50/02;;G01B15/04;;G01B11/2536;;B22F10/28;;B22F12/90;;B33Y30/00;;B33Y10/00;;B22F10/36;;B33Y30/00;;B33Y50/00;;B22F12/90;;B22F10/80;;G01B11/2527;;G01B11/2536,G01B11/25;;B22F10/80;;B22F12/90;;B33Y30/00;;B33Y50/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING
