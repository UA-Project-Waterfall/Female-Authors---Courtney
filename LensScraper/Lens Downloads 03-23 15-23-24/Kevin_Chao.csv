The sharp transition from zero ""glow current"" to full ""arc current"" at the end of the preheating period has been found to increase the life of lamps in the number of on-off starts, particularly with respect to lamps of poor quality. The rapid transition is possible because the ballast uses the same inverter and transformer for supplying preheating and operating voltages.

   A major problem in Lead Overlay design for GMR structures is that the magnetic read track width is wider than the physical read track width. This is due to high interfacial resistance between the leads and the GMR layer which is an unavoidable side effect of prior art methods. The present invention uses electroplating preceded by a wet etch to fabricate the leads. This approach requires only a thin protection layer over the GMR layer to ensure that interface resistance is minimal. Using wet surface cleaning avoids sputtering defects and plating is compatible with this so the cleaned surface is preserved Only a single lithography step is needed to define the track since there is no re-deposition involved.

This is due to high interfacial resistance between the leads and the GMR layer which is an unavoidable side effect of prior art methods. The present invention uses electroplating preceded by a wet etch to fabricate the leads. This approach requires only a thin protection layer over the GMR layer to ensure that interface resistance is minimal. Using wet surface cleaning avoids sputtering defects and plating is compatible with this so the cleaned surface is preserved Only a single lithography step is needed to define the track since there is no re-deposition involved.,HEADWAY TECHNOLOGIES INC,CHEN CHAO-PENG;;LIN KEVIN;;CHANG JEI-WEI;;JU KOCHAN;;WANG HUI-CHUAN,,https://lens.org/069-534-910-141-276,Granted Patent,yes,9,7,4,4,0,B82Y10/00;;G11B5/3116;;G11B5/3163;;G11B5/3903;;Y10T29/49044;;Y10T29/49052;;Y10T29/49046;;Y10T29/49021;;Y10T29/49032;;Y10T29/49048;;Y10T29/49041;;Y10T29/49128;;Y10T29/49044;;Y10T29/49052;;Y10T29/49046;;Y10T29/49021;;Y10T29/49032;;Y10T29/49048;;Y10T29/49041;;Y10T29/49128;;B82Y10/00;;G11B5/3116;;G11B5/3903;;G11B5/3163,G11B5/127;;G11B5/31;;G11B5/39;;H04R31/00,29/603.14;;29/603.07;;29/603.15;;29/603.16;;29/603.18;;205/119;;205/122;;360/234.1;;360/324.11;;360/324.12;;360/324.2;;427/127;;427/128;;438/369;;438/396;;438/706;;438/720;;438/722;;451/5;;451/41,3,2,004-842-460-801-711;;057-098-494-982-565,10.3379/jmsjmag.24.367;;10.1109/intmag.2000.872171,"Nakamoto et al.,""Read-Write Performance of GMR Heads with Lead Overlaid Structure,"" 2000 IEEE.;;Tanaka et al., ""Design and Fabrication for Sub Half Micron Core Width Spin Valve Read Head,"" 2000 IEEE.;;S.H.Liao et al. ,88-04.

This is due to high interfacial resistance between the leads and the GMR layer which is an unavoidable side effect of prior art methods. The present invention uses electroplating preceded by a wet etch to fabricate the leads. This approach requires only a thin protection layer over the GMR layer to ensure that interface resistance is minimal. Using wet surface cleaning avoids sputtering defects and plating is compatible with this so the cleaned surface is preserved Only a single lithography step is needed to define the track since there is no re-deposition involved.,HEADWAY TECHNOLOGIES INC,CHEN CHAO-PENG;;LIN KEVIN;;CHANG JEI-WEI;;JU KOCHAN;;WANG HUI-CHUAN,,https://lens.org/149-583-241-103-475,Patent Application,yes,8,1,4,4,0,B82Y10/00;;G11B5/3116;;G11B5/3163;;G11B5/3903;;Y10T29/49044;;Y10T29/49052;;Y10T29/49046;;Y10T29/49021;;Y10T29/49032;;Y10T29/49048;;Y10T29/49041;;Y10T29/49128;;Y10T29/49044;;Y10T29/49052;;Y10T29/49046;;Y10T29/49021;;Y10T29/49032;;Y10T29/49048;;Y10T29/49041;;Y10T29/49128;;B82Y10/00;;G11B5/3116;;G11B5/3903;;G11B5/3163,G11B5/127;;C25D5/02;;G11B5/31;;G11B5/39;;H04R31/00,29/603.07;;29/603.12;;205/125,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The memory shares routing lines used by a low level logic element thereby alleviating the need to add routing lines to an interconnect network just to satisfy the memory requirements.",ALTERA CORP;;QUICKTURN DESIGN,SAMPLE STEPHEN P;;BUTTS MICHAEL R;;NORMAN KEVIN A;;PATEL RAKESH H;;CHEN CHAO CHIANG,CADENCE DESIGN SYSTEMS INC (2012-02-27),https://lens.org/190-662-430-355-155,Granted Patent,yes,42,29,7,7,0,G11C7/1006;;G11C7/1075;;G11C7/22;;G11C8/16;;H03K19/177;;H03K19/17728;;H03K19/17736;;H03K19/1776;;H03K19/17764;;H03K19/17772;;H03K19/1778;;H03K19/17772;;G11C8/16;;H03K19/1778;;G11C7/1006;;G11C7/1075;;H03K19/17728;;H03K19/17736;;H03K19/17764;;G11C7/22;;H03K19/177;;H03K19/1776,G11C7/10;;G11C7/22;;G11C8/16;;H03K19/177,365/189.05;;365/189.02;;326/37;;326/39,25,11,075-347-089-846-516;;095-770-817-893-091;;084-919-347-343-506;;131-365-349-629-373;;080-800-033-458-075;;019-403-927-145-587;;025-274-696-871-168;;017-787-634-850-103;;043-274-752-375-920;;019-277-823-761-911;;019-258-191-895-546,10.1109/cicc.1990.124842;;10.1109/4.126539;;10.1109/cmpcon.1993.289700;;10.1109/t-c.1969.222754;;10.1109/tc.1970.5008902;;10.1109/tc.1977.1674879;;10.1109/tc.1979.1675426;;10.1109/tc.1984.1676396;;10.1109/fpga.1993.279481;;10.1109/fpga.1993.279480;;10.1109/jssc.1989.572595,"Masumoto, Rodney T., Configurable On Chip RAM Incorporated into High Speed Logic Array, IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, Jun. 1985, CH2157 6/85/0000 0240, pp. 240 243.;;Landry, Steve, Application Specific ICs, Relying on RAM, Implement Almost Any Logic Function, Electronic Design, Oct. 31, 1985, pp. 123 130.;;Bursky, Dave, Shrink Systems with One Chip Decoder, EPROM, and RAM, Electronic Design, Jul. 28, 1988, pp. 91 94.;;Kawana, Keiichi et al., An Efficient Logic Block Interconnect Architecture for User Reprogrammable Gate Array, IEEE 1990 Custom Integrated Circuits Conf., May 1990, CH2860 5/90/0000 0164, pp. 31.3.1 to 31.3.4.;;Shubat, Alexander et al., A Family of User Programmable Peripherals with a Functional Unit Architecture, IEEE Jor. of Solid State Circuits, vol. 27, No. 4, Apr. 1992, 0018 9200/92$03.00, pp. 515 529.;;AT&T s Orthogonal ORCA Targets the FPGA Future, 8029 Electronic Engineering, 64, No. 786, Jun. 1992, pp. 9 10.;;Bursky, Dave, FPGA Advances Cut Delays, Add Flexibility, 2328 Electronic Design, 40, No. 20, Oct. 1, 1992, pp. 35 43.;;Smith, Daniel, Intel s FLEXlogic FPGA Architecture, IEEE 1063 6390/93, 1993 pp. 378 384.;;Bursky, Dave, Denser, Faster FPGAS Vie for Gate Array Applications, 2328 Electronic Design, 41, No. 11, May 27, 1993, pp. 55 75.;;Ngai, Kai Kit Tony, An SRAM Programmable Field Reconfigurable Memory, University of Toronto, Canada, Jun. 1994, UMI Dissertation Services, pp. 1 68.;;Kautz, Cellular Logic in Memory Arrays, IEEE Trans. on Computers, vol.

Commercial share of wallet (“CSoW”) is the portion of the spending wallet that is captured by a particular financial company. A modeling approach utilizes various data sources to provide outputs that describe a company's spend capacity. Marketing companies that sell lists compile those lists by searching one or more databases for names and/or businesses that match certain criteria. Those marketing companies can use the CSoW/CSoSW modeling approach to show predicted spend and/or revenues for each company on a list.
