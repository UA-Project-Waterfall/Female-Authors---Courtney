   Several ways of identifying users and collecting demographic information and market information are disclosed, including branding a browser with a unique identification in each user request, identifying a user by his key strokes or mouse clicks, gathering demographic information using multiple data sets and by monitoring network traffic. Additionally, user requested content is distinguished from other, non-user content, and the performance of a server can be monitor and analyzed from a client a client perspective. Further, an Internet user's Internet data is routed to a known domain on the Internet, from which it is routed on to the intended recipient. The domain includes proxy servers which proxy the user's data requests to the domain, and database servers, which filter and build a database of the user's Internet usage. Particular data concerning certain behaviors of interest, such as purchasing data, is filtered into the database, and can form the basis for numerous market measures.

A connector (28) coupled to the capper unit is releasably coupled to the spindle by a quick release mechanism (62). The quick release mechanism is normally biased in the locked position and is configured to automatically move from the unlocked position back to the locked position when the connector mates with the spindle as a user re-connects the capping unit back to the spindle. Methods of releasing and re-connecting the capping unit to the spindle are also disclosed.

The task comprises searching for a message on the mobile device and the input received from the user comprises an instruction that the search is to be performed automatically. When additional input from the user is required to complete performance of the task after the instruction that the search is to be performed automatically is received from the user, the following steps are performed after the receiving step; prompting the user for the additional input, determining if the additional input is not being received from the user within a predefined time period, and generating at least one form of user notification as defined by a user profile associated with the user, if the additional input is not being received from the user within the predefined time period.

In at least one example embodiment, the encrypted session keys for every message content part comprising an attachment is received at the mobile device. In one embodiment, all of the encrypted session keys are stored together in a main message header. The mobile device may then decrypt the encrypted session key associated with a user requested attachment, and transmits the decrypted session key to one or more remote servers in an attachment request for use in decrypting the requested attachment. Data associated with the requested attachment, in decrypted form, is returned to the mobile device.

An encryption key is exchanged between a computing device (e.g. a mobile device) and a wireless output peripheral device (e.g. a printer, a headset). In exemplary embodiments, the encryption key is generated at the peripheral output device (336b). Data associated with the encryption key is output at the peripheral output device (340b), which can be input by the user at the computing device (342b). The encryption key is then recovered at the computing device from the input, thereby completing the key exchange (344b). The encryption key can then be used to encrypt and decrypt data transmitted over the established wireless connection, providing additional security (346b).

Auxiliary video segments can be computer generated for insertion between video segments captured by the cameras for smoothing the appearance of the resulting video.,360 REPLAYS LTD;;BROWN MICHAEL JAMES,BROWN MICHAEL JAMES,,https://lens.org/016-538-525-049-452,Patent Application,yes,3,2,3,3,0,H04N5/262;;H04N5/2627;;H04N5/783;;H04N5/91;;H04N9/8205;;H04N23/662;;H04N23/695;;H04N23/90;;H04N9/8205;;H04N5/2627;;H04N5/262;;H04N5/783;;H04N5/91;;H04N23/90;;H04N23/662;;H04N23/695,H04N5/262;;H04N5/232;;H04N5/91,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The capping device utilizes a drive member (32) rotatable about an operational axis for imparting rotation to a capper body (34) slidably coupled to the drive member. A helical spring (50) urges the capper body away from the drive member with a biasing force. An adjustment mechanism adjusts the biasing force thereby adjusting the axial force applied to the caps as they are threaded onto the containers. A pair of retaining pins (67) move between a latched position to prevent adjustment of the biasing force and an unlatched position to allow adjustment of the biasing force. The retaining pins are biased in the latched position to prevent inadvertent adjustment of the biasing force during use.

Motive means draws the shaft and piston toward the fluid receiving end of the cylinder. Travel of the piston in the direction from the fluid receiving end to the fluid discharging end of the cylinder is sensed at discrete locations to provide an indication of the volume of fluid therebetween and the related flow rate. Each of a plurality of emitter/detector modules provides piston position sensing signals reflective of the volume and rate of fluid flowing through the cylinder. A switch bar rigidly and permanently fixes the position of the emitter/detector modules with respect to the piston and with respect to one another. An immovable gate or aperture regulates the cross-section of the light beam striking the detector and ensures that the measured volume is repeatable and cannot be altered due to external factors such as in-field use, service, maintenance on components or the like.",BROWN MICHAEL D;;FLOW MAN DEVICES LLC,BROWN MICHAEL D,FLOW MANAGEMENT DEVICES LLC (2013-10-10),https://lens.org/003-518-973-645-282,Patent Application,yes,5,1,2,2,0,G01F25/11;;G01F25/11,G01F25/00,73/1.19,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

   A circuit for non-destructive sensing of polarized materials includes a signal generator to generate a periodic, alternating voltage signal. The alternating voltage signal is applied to at least one cell of polarized material, such that the cell produces a cell output signal. A synchronous rectifier then rectifies the cell output waveform into positive and negative rectified signals. A differentiating amplifier receives the positive and negative rectified signals and produces an output signal wherein the output signal represents a data state of the cell.

A helical spring urges the capper body away from the drive member with a biasing force. An adjustment mechanism adjusts the biasing force thereby adjusting the axial force applied to the caps as they are threaded onto the containers. A pair of retaining pins move between a latched position to prevent adjustment of the biasing force and an unlatched position to allow adjustment of the biasing force.
