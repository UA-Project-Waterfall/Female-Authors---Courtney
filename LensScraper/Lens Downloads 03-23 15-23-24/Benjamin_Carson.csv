The regulator measures real and reactive output power by calculating x-phasor components of the inverter's voltage and current output waveforms. Phasor calculation can be adapted for one or more pairs of single-phase voltages and currents. Determining the fundamental in-phase and quadrature components of output voltage and current reduces computational complexity by permitting the regulator to perform its power control processing largely in a dc signal domain, and enables separate real and reactive power control. The power inverter can include islanding detection logic, which exploits the ability to separately control reactive power. Exemplary islanding detection logic is based on determining whether changing the amount of reactive power output by the inverter induces an output frequency shift.",SQUARE D CO,CARSON GERALD BENJAMIN,,https://lens.org/098-906-114-028-877,Patent Application,no,0,0,8,8,0,H02J3/1835;;H02J3/48;;H02M7/53803;;Y02E40/30;;H02J3/388;;H02M7/53803;;H02J3/48;;H02J3/1835;;Y02E40/30;;H02J3/388,H02J3/00;;H02J3/18;;H02J3/48;;H02M7/537;;H02M7/538,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

This takes away the available sound energy by absorbing it or making it do work and dissipate before it can project audible sound outside the equipment structure or enclosure. “Damping” of the sound traveling through the equipment structure or enclosure is achieved by applying foam and/or fiberglass board/mat material to surfaces within the equipment structure or enclosure. By employing different material densities in the equipment structure or enclosure, sound levels at different frequencies can be diminished by not allowing them to pass through the structure or by greatly decreasing their amplitude. The semicircular sheathing within the equipment structure or enclosure that forms part of the airflow path refracts sound waves at different angles and does not make a good waveguide for transmitting the sound, which diminishes it.",POUNDS WILLIAM E;;CARSON OLIVER BENJAMIN;;CONCEALFAB CORP,POUNDS WILLIAM E;;CARSON OLIVER BENJAMIN,CONCEALFAB CORPORATION (2014-12-08),https://lens.org/069-846-712-437-538,Granted Patent,yes,18,11,1,1,0,G10K11/16;;G10K11/16,G10K11/04;;H04R1/02,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The regulator measures real and reactive output power by calculating x-phasor components of the inverter's voltage and current output waveforms. Phasor calculation can be adapted for one or more pairs of single-phase voltages and currents. Determining the fundamental in-phase and quadrature components of output voltage and current reduces computational complexity by permitting the regulator to perform its power control processing largely in a dc signal domain, and enables separate real and reactive power control. The power inverter can include islanding detection logic, which exploits the ability to separately control reactive power.
