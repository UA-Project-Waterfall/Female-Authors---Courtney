As the electrode traverses subcortical structures toward a target neural structure, neural activity is analyzed. The neural activity is converted to electrical signals. Features pertaining to characteristics of the neural activity are extracted from the electrical signals. The features are synergistically combined using fuzzy clustering logic, for example. In an example embodiment, the combined results are provided in a form of a color coded map indicating the different structural regions traversed. Observation of the map provides an objective indication of the demarcations of the various structural regions traversed and an objective technique for classifying the structural regions.",UNIV PENNSYLVANIA;;DANISH SHABBAR F;;WONG STEPHEN;;BALTUCH GORDON H;;JAGGI JURG L,DANISH SHABBAR F;;WONG STEPHEN;;BALTUCH GORDON H;;JAGGI JURG L,,https://lens.org/166-233-529-691-321,Patent Application,yes,3,0,3,3,0,A61B5/369;;A61B5/7264;;A61B5/369;;A61B5/4064;;A61B5/4064;;A61B5/7203;;A61B5/7203;;A61B5/7264;;G16H50/20,A61B5/04,,0,0,,,,PENDING
