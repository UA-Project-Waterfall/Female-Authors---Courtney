Transactions at the stock room are identified as to amount, cost center, date, and other information which is transferred to a network services host computer. This transaction information is then transferred as a batch to a merchant accounting system which transfers the information to the bank card association to the card issuer. The card issuer then provides a funds payment that is transferred through the bank card network to the merchant accounting system and finally to the merchant acquirer. The merchant acquirer, however, then transfers the funds back to the credit card issuer to cancel out the original funds transfer and thereby provide a closed loop funds transfer. The bank card association generates transaction information which is passed through the merchant accounting system to the merchant acquirer which in turn pays an interchange fee that is transferred through the merchant accounting system to the bank card association and ultimately into an account for the credit card issuer. Periodically, the merchant accounting system provides a comprehensive collection of the transaction information performed by the stock room to the credit card issuer who in turn generates a transaction report that is provided to the business entity for updating its general ledger. At the close of a month, the totality of transactions for the stock room of the business entity is communicated to the credit card issuer which in turn determines the amount of interchange fees it has received from the merchant acquirer and pays a corresponding amount for the interchange fees back to the merchant acquirer, thus essentially zeroing out the interchange fees in a closed loop manner. A statement for the service of generating the transactions report is then issued by the credit card issuer to the business entity.",PAYMENTECH INC,SMITH CYNTHIA M;;BAUMGARTNER JAMES W,,https://lens.org/140-775-192-797-368,Patent Application,yes,0,4,5,5,0,G06Q20/02;;G06Q20/02;;G06Q20/023;;G06Q20/023;;G06Q20/04;;G06Q20/04;;G06Q20/10;;G06Q20/10;;G06Q20/14;;G06Q20/14,G06Q20/02;;G06Q20/04;;G06Q20/10;;G06Q20/14,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   A brake system and method of controlling the system are disclosed. The system provides secondary hydraulic braking in a de-energized mode. The system includes a wheel brake associated with wheels of a vehicle typically at each corner of the vehicle. The wheel brake typically includes a caliper or drum for deceleration of the vehicle. The system includes a master cylinder in fluid communication with the wheel brake. In the de-energized mode, the master cylinder operates the wheel brake. A solenoid isolation valve decouples the master cylinder from the wheel brake when the system is in a normal, i.e., an energized, mode. As such, the master cylinder is isolated from the wheel brake and is prevented from operating the wheel brake. Alternatively, in the de-energized mode, the isolation valve couples the master cylinder with the wheel brake to provide the secondary hydraulic braking. The system includes an actuator assembly for operation of the wheel brake independent of the master cylinder when the system is in the energized operational mode. A second, normally-closed, solenoid valve opens in the energized mode to couple the actuator assembly with the wheel brake. The second solenoid valve closes in the de-energized mode to isolate the actuator assembly from the wheel brake such that the secondary hydraulic braking is provided through the master cylinder.

    A method and apparatus for dynamically driving events in a simulation of a data processing system are implemented. Events, or system states, are generated by drivers located at predetermined locations within the simulation model under test. 

    These events, which are drawn from a predetermined class of events, termed effects, are driven in response to other events observed by monitors disposed within the simulation model in accordance with a predetermined set of causes, and a set of rules that map causes to effects. The driving of events is mediated by a library process that receives observed events from the monitors, in the form of data structures, stored them in a database, and passes the effects to be driven to the appropriate driver in accordance with the set of rules, also data structures stored in the database, when a cause corresponds to a observed event.

   A disk for calibrating glide heads utilizes a dual-zone configuration of multiple laser melt bumps having selected heights. Averaging the PZT response over many bumps significantly narrows the response distribution, resulting in greater certainty and correlation of the PZT amplitude to bump height. The multiple calibration bumps are circumferentially arranged on a disk surface at a selected radius in a ring-like manner. A second head cleaning zone is provided near the inner diameter of the disk to provide for increased reproducibility of the PZT calibration response. The second zone is densely textured and serves to clean the glide head prior to its use in the calibration zone.
