    A housing having an integral receptacle which is particularly useful for pencil sharpeners. The receptacle is attached to the body so as to be pivotable between a closed position, for closing a cavity of the housing, and an open position, for exposing the cavity. This is useful, for example, for emptying pencil shavings in a pencil sharpener. 

    Attachment of the receptacle to the housing minimizes accidental opening of the receptacle and spillage of shavings. In the open position, the receptacle also serves as a spout for controlled disposal of shavings. 

    In the preferred embodiment, the housing and receptacle have a mating rib and groove on opposing sides of the cavity which interfit when the receptacle is in the closed position to form a seal trap shavings within the cavity. Additionally, the receptacle is provided with a lower surface and rearward edge positioned to form a seal with the housing when the cover is in the closed and open positions, respectively. The receptacle may be provided with an interlock trigger for engaging and disengaging an interlock switch in the housing to prevent operation of the cutting assembly of a pencil sharpener when the receptacle is in an open position.
