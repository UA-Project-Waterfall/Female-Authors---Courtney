This invention provides a passive thermally controlled bypass valve to enable an exhaust flow to avoid an enthalpy loss incurred by driving a turbine wheel of a turbocharger, and thus, more rapidly supply heat to a catalyst or the after-treatment device. <P>COPYRIGHT: (C)2010,JPO&INPIT",BORGWARNER INC,ANDREWS DAVID,,https://lens.org/080-208-157-210-108,Patent Application,no,6,6,6,6,0,F01D17/085;;F01D17/141;;F01N13/08;;F01N13/1816;;F02B37/183;;F02B37/186;;F16K31/002;;F05D2220/40;;Y10T137/7737;;Y02T10/12;;Y10T137/7737;;F02B37/183;;F01D17/141;;F01N13/08;;F01D17/085;;F02B37/186;;F16K31/002;;F01N13/1816;;F05D2220/40;;Y02T10/12,F02B37/18;;F01N3/20;;F01N3/24,,0,0,,,,PENDING

July 26, 1962 [Oct. 23, 1961], No. 37901/61. Heading F2S. [Also in Division G3] The movement of a manually-operated speed control lever 16 of a centrifugal governor for controlling the injection of fuel into an I.C. engine is assisted or opposed by a first spring unit 1 which comprises two metal springs 3, 4 located between a plate 5, which bears against the fuel injector, and a displaceable plate 6 which varies the force exerted on the plate 5 and a second spring unit 7 which opposes movement of the displaceable plate 6 with a force which increases and decreases as the force of the first spring unit increases and decreases the difference between the forces of the two units being less than the maximum force of the first unit 1. In this way the force of the first spring unit 1 can be increased by using a manual control force which is less than the maximum force of the first spring unit. The plate 6 carries a piston 8 with cam surfaces 9 and a rod 14 which slides in a guide sleeve 15 in a fixed housing 12. A pair of opposed leaf springs 11, secured to the housing 12, carry rollers 13 at their free ends which engage the cam surfaces 9. When the springs 3, 4 are not compressed the leaf springs 11 transfer no component of force in the direction of movement of the plate 6. When it is desired to increase the force exerted by the first spring unit the control lever 16 is actuated to move the rod 8 so that the plate 6 moves to compress the springs 3, 4 and the rollers 13 move along the cam surfaces 9 so that the springs 11 exert an axial force which backs up the movement of the plate 6. Each spring unit 1 may be constructed to have a linear force-displacement characteristic.

July 14, 1964 [July 30, 1963], No. 30212/63. Heading G3P. [Also in Division F1] The invention relates to a control system for a gas turbine jet engine having a variable area jet nozzle and at least two reheat burner assemblies located downstream of the turbine to supply reheat fuel to gases discharging through the nozzle. A manually operable control is provided for selecting the total fuel flow for the reheat burners, also a nozzle area control which is responsive to an operating condition of the engine to adjust the nozzle area in the sense to tend to maintain the condition constant. Selector valves are provided and arranged to feed fuel successively to the burner assemblies with increase in total fuel flow and to shut off fuel flow successively from the burner assemblies with reduction in total fuel flow, there being also hysteresis means to ensure that the position of the manually-operable control at which fuel starts to flow to a burner assembly during increase of total flow is different from the position of the control at which fuel is shut off from the burner assembly during reduction of total fuel flow. A gas turbine jet engine is indicated at 1 Fig. 1 and comprises three reheat fuel assemblies 3, 4 and 5 also a variable area nozzle comprising flaps 6 and 7 pivotally mounted at 8 and 9 and actuated by ram devices 14, 15 which are supplied with fluid under pressure through lines 18, 19. A feedback link 21 is connected to the ram rod 16, the link being connected with linkage 71. Hydraulic fluid is supplied to the lines 18, 19 from a pump 22 see Fig. 7 the pump discharge through the line 24 being controlled by a valve assembly 25 which comprises a spool valve 31 having three spaced lands, the central land 29 controlling flow of fluid to the lines 18, 19. The axial position of the valve 31 is controlled by pressure fluid supplied through lines 39, 41 to either end thereof, the lines 39, 41 extending from control valve 42, Fig. 6. The valve 42 comprises a spool valve 45 having three spaced lands 46, 47, 48, and a cylindrical sleeve 44 having ports 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, the sleeve being slidably mounted within a cylinder 43. The sleeve 44 is formed with a servo piston 61 having a projection 65 which is formed with a bore 66 which communicates with the space below the piston 61. Leakage of fluid through the bore 66 is controlled by a cam 68 which is rotated by means of the feedback linkage 71 extending from the variable area nozzle actuators Fig. 1. The servo piston 61 and hence the sleeve 44 will follow movement of the cam 68. The spool valve 45 is pivotally connected at 74 to a lever 75 pivotally mounted at 76, the lever being urged by a spring so that the follower 77 engages against the three-dimensional cam 78. The cam 78 is rotatable by means of a rod 85 which is formed with a rack 84 which engages pinion 83, the position of the rod 85 being controlled by the pilot's lever 89 acting through cam 92 and caged spring device 93. Movement of the rod 85 will cause axial movement of the spool valve 45 by way of the cam 78 and lever 75 and movement of the spool valve will cause hydraulic fluid to flow to one of the lines 39, 41 and thus cause axial movement of the spool valve 31, Fig. 7 and thus cause hydraulic fluid to flow from the pump 22 to one of the lines 18, 19 and thus cause the actuators 14, 15 Fig. 1 to move the variable area nozzle flaps 6, 7. Movement of the flaps 6, 7 is fed back through the linkage 71 to the cam 68 whereby the sleeve 44 will move axially to bring the ports 55, 57, 59 in the sleeve back into coincidence with the lands 46, 47, 48 of the spool valve 45. The sleeve 44 is connected to the rod 85 by means of a lost motion device 87, 88. The reheat control lever 89 is carried by a shaft 91 on which is mounted the cam 92 also three further cams 101, 102,103 having stepped profiles. The feed back link 71 from the variable area nozzle Fig. 1, also carries three cams 107, 108, 109, see Fig. 6, the cams 107, 108, 109 being formed with profiles having double steps as shown. The cams 101 and 107 together co-operate with a floating lever 117 which carries a valve member 119 which co-operates with a vent 121 at the end of line 141. Similarly the cams 102, 108 co-operate with a floating lever 122 which carries a valve member 125 which co-operates with a vent 126 at the end of line 377. And similarly the cams 103, 109 co-operates with a floating lever 127 which carries a valve member 131 which co-operates with a vent 132 at the end of line 378. The arrangement is such that the valve members 119, 125 and 131 may be lifted from the vents 121, 126 and 132 by particular combinations of positions of the associated cams. The computing unit 151 Fig. 5 responds to the pressure ratio across the turbine and it is this ratio which is the condition for engine operation to assist in the control of the variable area nozzle flaps, Fig. 1. The unit comprises two pairs of bellows 153, 154 and 162, 163, the bellows of each pair being interconnected and connected to the ends of a lever 156 which is pivotally mounted at 157. The lever 156 co-operates with a pair of leak-offs 176, 177 which lead from cylinder 167 at either side of piston 168. The bellows 153 and 162 are evacuated, bellows 154 is subject to the pressure existing in chamber 161, and the bellows 163 is connected to the pressure downstream of the turbine. Air at compressor discharge pressure is supplied through line 182 to the space 161, the flow being controlled by the tapered end 178 of piston rod 169, the pressure in chamber 161 being a constant fraction of the compressor delivery pressure for any one position of the piston rod. The piston rod 171 extends to a chamber 184 and is formed at its lower end with a flattened surface 185 having a vent 192 with which co-operates a cam 194, the vent 192 being supplied with liquid under pressure through line 63 which also supplies liquid to the two ends of cylinder 167. A piston 201 is arranged so as to move in accordance with the degree of closure of the cam profile 196 over the vent 192. The piston rod 202 of piston 201 is connected through linkage 203 to a lever 188, Fig. 6, which is adapted to move the cam 78 in an axial direction. Cam 194 is actuated by means of a servo-piston 206, fluid being supplied to one side or the other thereof by means of an electro-hydraulic servo-valve 208, the valve being operated in dependence on an electrical temperature sensing device at the inlet of the engine compressor. A centrifugal pump 511, Fig. 3 is provided for the supply of reheat fuel to the galleries 3, 4, 5, the pump operating on the vapour core principle. The pump comprises an impeller 513 which discharges through outlet 215. Fuel is supplied to the pump inlet 533 at boost pressure and then passes through inlet 518 which is controlled by valve 534, to the space within the sleeve 517. The sleeve 517 is formed with openings 516 which are controlled by an axially movable sleeve 524, fuel passing through the openings 516, when they are uncovered,to the pump impeller. The sleeve 524 is controlled by a servo-piston 523, fuel from the engine-main fuel system being supplied to both sides of the piston through line 525. The valve 534 is controlled by means of a servo-piston 537 to the lower side of which fuel from the main fuel system is also supplied as the servo-fluid. A vent pipe 527 leads from the left-hand end of the servo cylinder 522 to a servo-vent 228 in a vent unit 229, see Fig. 9, so that adjustment of the vent 228 will determine the position of the piston 523 and thus the opening of the apertures 516. A duct 141 leads from the lower end of the cylinder 536 to the vent 121 Fig. 6 so that upon closure of the vent 121 the piston 537 will move upwards to lift the valve member 534 off its seat thus allowing fuel to pass into the pump 511. Fuel delivered by the pump 511 through the outlet 215 passes through a flow control unit 216, Fig. 9, before discharging through duct 217 to the reheat fuel manifold 3 Fig. 1. The control unit 216 comprises a sleeve 219 disposed within a cylinder 218, the sleeve having ports 223 which co-operate with ports 222 in the cylinder to form a metering orifice. The sleeve is controlled by means of a servo-piston 224 disposed in cylinder 225. The piston rod 227 carries a spring retainer 240, a spring 230 being disposed between the retainer 240 and the lever 232 which is pivotally mounted at 233 and is connected at its other end between a pair of bellows 234, 235, bellows 234 being evacuated and bellows 235 being connected through line 238 to a control pressure proportional to delivery pressure of the engine compressor. The servo piston 224 is energized by fuel under pressure from the main fuel system supplied through line 525, the fuel passing through a pair of restrictors 239, 241. Lines 242, 243 pass from the two ends of cylinder 225 to servo-vents 244, 245 which are controlled by the lever 232. The arrangement is such that with increase in pressure supplied through line 238, that is with increase is compressor delivery pressure, the ports 223 coincide to a greater extent with the port 222 permitting increased flow of fuel through line 217 to the first reheat manifold. The vent unit 229, Fig. 9, is provided to control pressure drop across the metering orifice 222, 223, the unit comprising a pair of chambers 246, 247, the chamber 246 containing a bellows 252 which is connected at its free end to a lever 248 pivotally mounted at 251, the end of the lever within the chamber 247 co-operating with a vent 228. The pressure of fuel upstream of the metering orifice 222, 223 is communicated to the chamber 246 through line 256, and pressure of fuel downstream of the orifice is communicated to the interior of bellows 252 through line 255. The vent 228 communicates by way of line 527",DOWTY FUEL SYST LTD,ANDREWS DAVID KEITH,,https://lens.org/138-906-394-102-806,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,F02K1/16;;F02K1/16;;F02K1/17;;F02K1/17,F02K1/16;;F02K1/17,F1C CD            CD;;F1C C104          CD;;F1C C2J1A         -;;F1C C2J2J3        -;;F1C C2J3          -;;F1C C501          CD;;F1C C521          CD;;F1C C530          CD;;F1C C602          CD;;F1J J1F1          -;;F1J J2A1C         -;;F1J J3            -;;G3P P1C           -;;G3P P1E           -;;G3P P11           -;;G3P P16EX         -;;G3P P16E2         -;;G3P P16E3         -;;G3P P16E5         -;;G3P P16E6         -;;G3P P18           -;;G3P P22           -;;G3P P24KX         -;;G3P P24K3         -;;G3P P24X          -;;G3P P27X          -;;G3P P3            -;;G3P P5            -;;G3P P6            -;;G3P P8            -;;G3P P9A2          -;;G3P P9A5          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Received signals from echo-waves are processed so that operational noise is largely eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level then collected and stored or archived; newly received and processed signals are also compared with existing archive signals and a decision is made for each new signal if it is representative of the structure being unchanged or representative of the structure after significant structural change has occurred. Results of decisions at locations of interest are combined to give a graded risk for the structure as a whole as well as identifying specific locations of significant structural change. An operator is warned when a threshold risk is reached allowing response actions to be initiated, for example: safety procedures and/or repair procedures.

   A mass transit system of a transit authority automatically determines and applies the lowest possible transit fare to a patron's account, thereby releasing the patron from decisions leading to the most cost effective fare instrument for his or her transit pattern. A fair fare system and method utilizes the transit authority's existing hardware infrastructure, i.e., mainframe, vendors, gates, smart card and Point of Issue (POI) devices, with additional processing mechanisms for determining the best fare over rolling time periods. Because a relatively large storage capacity of the fare instrument is required, smart cards are employed for use with the fare fair system.

Responses are propagated via a reverse traversal of the nodes. The reverse traversal is optimized by merging responses at different tiers.

The invention described in Specification 1, 153, 993 is modified by providing a controlled return flow of pumped liquid through lines 5,6 to inlet duct 1 to reduce the net positive suction pressure and thereby obtain substantially constant delivery pressure at constant pump speed. The return flow is controlled by a valve member 9 biased to its minimum flow position by a spring 10 adjustable by screw 12. The return flow is directed into the inlet duct against the main flow to reduce the net positive suction pressure, through one or more nozzles 15 carried by a ring-shaped pipe 14. Alternatively or additionally, the return flow may be directed with an upstream component of motion through an annular opening at a number of circumferentially spaced openings in the wall of the inlet duct. When introduced through the annular opening the return flow also reduces the effective flow area through the inlet duct.",ROLLS ROYCE,ANDREWS EDWARD GEORGE DAVID,,https://lens.org/146-383-647-021-263,Granted Patent,no,0,2,2,2,0,F04D29/669;;F04D15/0011,F04D15/00;;F04D29/66,F1C CD            CD;;F1C C1K           -;;F1C C110          CD;;F1C C2F1          -;;F1C C2J1A         -;;F1C C2J2A         -;;F1C C2J2J1        -;;F1C C2J2J3        -;;F1C C501          CD;;F1C C511          CD;;F1C C519          CD;;F1C C521          CD,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The propagation of messaging across the distributed platform is accelerated based on a parallel fan-out distribution of the flood messaging from increasing numbers of nodes with the distribution occurring over existing connections maintained between different sets of nodes. Responses are propagated via a reverse traversal of the nodes. The reverse traversal is optimized by merging responses at different tiers. A set of triggers set at the different nodes specify conditions with which to identify and preempt the slowest nodes of a lower tier from withholding message flooding completion.

This compound is then esterified with a novel series of reagents to give the 17-ester which can be reduced the corresponding 17-allene. Oxidation of this allene to the bis-epoxide compound, followed by treatment with an alkali metal salt of a carboxylic acid under phase transfer conditions gives the 17 alpha -hydroxy 21-ester 9 alpha -carbonate.

As shown, a pair of such sealing members 22 which are bolted to a steel liner 14, one each side of an aperture 18 opening into a pressure vessel 10, and are a close or interference fit around the outer surface of a removable cylindrical or oval-section pod 16. The sealing face of the end portion 28, or the adjacent surface to be sealed, may be provided with labyrinth or ring seals 34. When the pod 16 is to be withdrawn, the end portion 28 is expanded either by activating electrical heating coils 36 embedded or provided externally on the end portion or by supplying hot fluid to passages in the end portion. Alternatively, the sealing member may be reversed with the end portion 28 being secured to the pod 16 and the end portion 26 being provided with passages to which a coolant, such as nitrogen, is supplied to cause disengagement from the liner 14 by contraction. Another way of carrying the invention into effect is to have the close or interference fit maintained by continuous cooling or heating and then broken by removing the supply of coolant or heat. If desired, both the end portions 26, 28 could be arranged to project in the same radial direction.",ROLLS ROYCE,ANDREWS EDWARD GEORGE DAVID,,https://lens.org/136-569-507-472-911,Granted Patent,no,0,2,5,5,0,F01D11/005;;F01D11/005;;F16J15/027;;F16J15/027;;F16J15/164;;F16J15/164;;Y10S277/919;;Y10S277/919;;Y10S277/93;;Y10S277/93,F01D11/00;;F16J15/02;;F16J15/16,F2B B1X6          B1X,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The 9 alpha -carbonates are prepared by reaction of the corresponding 9 alpha -hydroxy steroid with a sequence of excess base, trialkylsilyl chloride, alkyl haloformate and alkanol or by using excess base, alkyl haloformate and alkoxide. 9 alpha -Carbonate-17-keto compounds can be treated with lithium acetylide and a lithium salt to afford the corresponding 17 alpha -ethynyl-17 beta -hydroxy-9 alpha -carbonate. This compound is then esterified with a novel series of reagents to give the 17-ester which can be reduced the corresponding 17-allene. Oxidation of this allene to the bis-epoxide compound, followed by treatment with an alkali metal salt of a carboxylic acid under phase transfer conditions gives the 17 alpha -hydroxy 21-ester 9 alpha -carbonate.

   A system and method for advertising and negotiating services for commercial and general aviation are provided. With the present invention, a pilot of an aircraft may enter into a computing device specific information about a desired service that the pilot wishes to have available upon arrival at a destination airport. This information is then transmitted to an airport bartering system that barters with fixed based operator (FBO) computing systems at the airport for the desired services. The airport bartering system ranks the latest quotes from the FBOs based on criteria identified by the pilot in the original request for the desired service. Advertisements for the top ranked FBOs are then generated and transmitted to the aircraft computer system from which the request for services was sent. The advertisements received at the aircraft computer system are displayed on an associated display for viewing by the pilot. The pilot may then select an advertisement in order to generate an order for the desired service. The order for the desired service is then transmitted to the airport bartering system which then forwards the order to the FBO computer system associated with the FBO of the selected advertisement.

The 9.alpha.-carbonates are prepared by reaction of the corresponding 9.alpha.-hydroxy steroid with a sequence of excess base, trialkylsilyl chloride, alkyl haloformate and alkanol or by using excess base, alkyl haloformate and alkoxide. 9.alpha.-Carbonate-17-keto compounds can be treated with lithium acetylide and a lithium salt to afford the corresponding 17.alpha.-ethynyl-17.beta.-hydroxy-9.alpha.-carbonate. This compound is then esterified with a novel series of reagents to give the 17-ester which can be reduced the corresponding 17-allene. Oxidation of this allene to the bis-epoxide compound, followed by treatment with an alkali metal salt of a carboxylic acid under phase transfer conditions gives 17.alpha.-hydroxy 21-ester 9.alpha.-carbonate.

DOWTY FUEL SYSTEMS Ltd. Oct. 7, 1960 [Oct. 12, 1959], No. 34510/59. Heading F1G. [Also in Division G3] A gas turbine fuel system includes an engine speed sensitive governor 9, 14 arranged to adjust means 13 to vary the compressor output pressure applied to means for adjusting the fuel flow to the engine. The governor consists of a flyweight 9 pivotally mounted at 12 on an engine driven shaft 1 and has a spring-loaded arm 13 to co-operate with a fixed bleed orifice 15 in a duct 23 conveying compressor output pressure to a bellows 28 connected by a strut 29 with an evacuated bellows 27 and by a pin 31 with a lever 32 pivoted at 33. Movement of this lever adjusts a half ball valve 34 cooperating with the bleed orifice 35 of a doubleacting piston 45 which is supplied with fuel under pressure through a line 47 and a restrictor 48 and operates a piston valve 41 in the main fuel supply line 42, 44 to the engine. The valve 41 is coupled by a spring 37 to the lever 32 which is also acted upon by a pre-set spring 36. A gear pump 4 driven by the shaft 1 supplies fuel through a line 7 to a valve unit 52 including a spring-loaded valve 54 to prevent fuel from being supplied to the piston 45 during starting and a by-pass valve 65 to maintain the pressure drop across the valve 41 in the main fuel supply line constant. The valve 65 is operated by a piston 63 subjected to the pressure drop while the valve 54 has an aperture 55 to maintain a constant supply to the valve 41. When the turbine is to be stopped, a solenoid by-pass valve 74 is opened to allow a valve 71 to close the main fuel line. The governed speed may be adjusted over a small range by a manually set restrictor 21.",DOWTY FUEL SYST LTD,TYLER STANLEY RALPH;;ANDREWS DAVID KEITH,,https://lens.org/014-832-358-039-795,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,F02C9/32,F02C9/32,F1G G10B          G10B;;F1G G10E1A2       G10E2A;;F1G G10E1B3       G10E2A;;F1G G10E1B4       G10E2A,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A system and method for advanced warning of severe weather for general aviation aircraft is presented. An aircraft includes an onboard weather tracker which monitors atmospheric condition changes. The weather tracker uses data from an onboard barometric altimeter and a GPS device to calculate air pressure changes in order to identify when the aircraft is flying into a low-pressure zone. The weather tracker uses the air pressure's rate of change and the aircraft's speed to determine the criticality of a situation and appropriately notifies a pilot. The weather tracker provides the pilot with local airport information and alternative flight pattern information per the pilot's request.

   A console flight management system and method are provided. With the system and method, sensor/instrument signals are obtained from sensors and instruments of the aircraft and are passed through one or more driver interfaces. The driver interfaces act as device drivers for the particular sensors and instruments and convert the signals received into a standardized data format. The sensor/instrument data obtained from the sensor/instrument signals, which has been formatted to the standardized data format, is then provided to a flight management information correlation engine. The flight management information correlation engine obtains correlation rules and correlation configuration data from associated databases and applies the correlation rules and correlation configuration data to the formatted sensor/instrument data. The result is a correlation of the sensor/instrument data that provides meaningful information to a pilot such that the information aides the pilot in the operation of the aircraft based on the current sensor and instrument readings. The output from the application of the correlation rules and correlation configuration data to the sensor/instrument data is then formatted using templates established for different types of portable devices. The formatted output is then sent to an input/output interface which may transmit the output via a wired or wireless connection to the portable device.

Dec. 3, 1968 [Dec.9, 1967], No.56079/67. Heading F1J. A bi-propellant rocket engine comprises a combustion chamber and a pair of tanks in which the propellants are stored separately of each other, each of the tanks being arranged to communicate, during operation of the engine, with the combustion chamber and being disposed coaxially one within the other, a portion of the outer peripheral wall of the inner tank and a corresponding portion of the inner peripheral wall of the outer tank being spaced apart radially and shaped to define therebetween an annular propulsion nozzle communicating with the combustion chamber. In Fig.1 the assembly comprises an inner propellant tank 1 of annular form and an outer propellant tank 2 also of annular form, the rearward portions 6 and 7 of the outer peripheral wall 3 of the inner tank and of the inner peripheral wall 4 of the outer tank being shaped so as to define an annular combustion chamber 10 and an annular propulsion nozzle 11. The outer tank 2 is engaged axially over the inner tank 1 until the radial surfaces 5 abut. Baffle members 14, 15 are disposed adjacent the wall portions 6 and 7 so that fuel flows upstream through the passage between the baffles 14, 15 and the adjacent wall portions 6, 7 to the injection ports 12, 13. The injection ports are initially closed by shear cups 16, 17 which are engaged within annular grooves 20, 21 formed in the walls of an annular piston 22 which is movable axially within a chamber 23 from the initial position shown to an operative position in which it abuts against the stop rings 24, 25. Such axial movement of the annular piston causes the cups 16, 17 to shear so that the propellants may pass through the injection ports 12, 13 through ports 26, 27 in the walls of che piston to a mixing space within the piston, the mixed propellants then discharging through ports 28, 29 into the combustion chamber 10. A solid propellant charge 38 is contained within breech 37 and upon firing by igniter 39, gases pass through bore 36 to the chamber 23 thus causing the piston 22 to move axially to the operative position. At the same time gases pass through bores 40, 41 bursting the sealing discs 42, 43 to the propellant chambers 1, 2 thus acting to pressurize the propellants within the chambers. A further rocket engine may be mounted in the space 45 within the inner propellant tank 1, Fig.5 (not shown). In place of an annular combustion chamber, a series of cylindrical chambers may be provided.

The server screens the inbound message for attacks using a first set of rules and policies defined as part of a production profile from a WAF instance defined by the specific customer while contemporaneously testing the inbound message against a second set of rules and polices defined as part of an audit profile from the same WAF instance. In this manner, the specific customer tests the audit profile rules and policies while still receiving the protections of the production profile rules and policies.",VERIZON DIGITAL MEDIA SERVICES INC,PHONSA VIKAS;;KIM HAYES;;ANDREWS DAVID,EDGECAST INC (2021-11-01);;EDGIO INC (2022-10-21),https://lens.org/079-821-139-496-827,Granted Patent,yes,2,3,4,4,0,H04L63/0263;;H04L63/0263;;H04L63/0218;;H04L63/0218;;H04L63/1433;;H04L63/1433,H04L29/00;;H04L29/06,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The objects of the method and system are achieved as is now described. At least one resistive element is placed in series with each monitoring electrode. The impedance of the resistive element is chosen such that the impedance is greater than the typical impedance that could be measured between a pair of accurately placed and properly prepared defibrillation electrodes. The resulting series resistive element-monitoring electrode combination is then utilized to distinguish between monitoring electrodes and defibrillation electrodes in an electric circuit electrically connecting combination defibrillation-heart monitoring equipment to a patient. In order to distinguish between the different types of electrodes, the impedance of the circuit formed by electrodes electrically connected to the patient is measured. If the measured impedance is greater than or equal to the impedance of the resistive element placed in series with the monitoring electrodes, then it is determined either that one or more monitoring electrodes are in use or that the defibrillation electrodes are not in good contact with the patient. If it is determined that one or more monitoring electrodes are in use or that the defibrillation electrodes are not in good contact with the patient, the operator is alerted to the determination and appropriate corrective actions are taken before a defibrillation discharge is allowed.",HEWLETT PACKARD CO,BURTON DAVID L;;ANDREWS JONATHAN N,HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY (1997-01-17);;HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY A DELAWARE CORPORATION (1998-05-20);;AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES INC (1999-11-01);;KONINKLIJKE PHILIPS ELECTRONICS N.V (2001-08-01),https://lens.org/082-624-312-517-27X,Granted Patent,yes,14,14,1,1,0,A61N1/3931;;A61N1/3931,A61N1/39,607/2,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A first element is housed in a thermally conductive sheath and hence reacts quickly to changing temperatures outside the detector, while the other element is surrounded by less thermally transmissive structure and reacts more slowly. The two elements are biased apart by a compression spring and an additional spring biases the first-mentioned element only. A rod connected with the first element carries an electrical contact which closes the gap with a fixed contact when that element overcomes the biases of the two springs and the further bias of the other SME element, the movement of the first element being thus related to the rate of rise of temperature experienced outside the detector. In another embodiment the two SME elements are again subject to different rates of heat transmission from the environment but are biased equally, and the output is related to the difference in deflection between the two elements.",CHUBB FIRE SECURITY LTD,ANDREWS DAVID J;;HART WILLIAM B,,https://lens.org/083-671-920-908-731,Granted Patent,no,0,0,6,11,0,H01H37/323;;H01H2061/0115,H01H37/32,340-157,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A detector such as an accelerometer 1 is placed against the end of the log to measure the echo as the wave from the impact of the hammer are reflected from the sides and opposite end of the log. The signal is analysed mathematically to obtain a measure of the fundamental frequency fo of the log. The length L of the log is measured separately and used in the process of calculating fo. The analysis of the echo may involve testing all spectral peaks for membership to a series from which a best value of fo can be derived. The fundamental frequency is related to the plane wave speed V and length L by V = 2L/fo. Noise spikes, peaks from unwanted modes, or other spurious signals are filtered using a comb filter.

This compound is then esterified with a novel series of reagents to give the 17-ester which can be reduced the corresponding 17-allene. Oxidation of this allene to the bis-epoxide compound, followed by treatment with an alkali metal salt of a carboxylic acid under phase transfer conditions gives the 17 alpha -hydroxy 21-ester 9 alpha -carbonate.

The analysis is performed with best fit recognition procedure or one that emphasizes high harmonics to determine a fundamental frequency related to acoustic speed, which is indicative the stiffness characteristics of the tree stem or log. The apparatus uses a compliantly mounted accelerometer pressed against one end of the tree stem to defect reflections from the other end after impacting the first end. Also disclosed is a method of cutting a stem into logs by establishing a function that represents the nature of speed variation with distance along the stem characteristic for a species and locality. The average speed along a stem and the speed function are used to compute the likely speed at points along the stem, and then the stems are routed for cutting according to their speed.

Centrifugal pumps; gas turbine engine fuel systems. DOWTY FUEL SYSTEMS Ltd. Jan.23, 1969 [Jan.23, 1968], No.4316/68. Headings F1C and F1G. Liquid fuel is supplied to the burners of a gas turbine engine by a centrifugal pump followed by a positive displacement pump, control means responsive to the flow of fuel to the burners being operable to regulate the effective delivery of the positive displacement pump when the flow demand is less than that which the positive displacement pump is capable of delivering at the speed at which it is driven, and the centrifugal pump being driven at a variable speed which is responsive to the flow to the burners whereby when the flow demand exceeds that which the positive displacement pump is capable of delivering, the centrifugal pump is driven at a speed at which it develops the pressure required to sustain the flow demand, the excess of demanded flow over displacement of the positive displacement pump being bypassed across the latter. Fuel is supplied to burners 7, Fig.1, by a centrifugal pump 2 driven by an air turbine 71, a line 3, an engine-driven positive displacement pump 4 and a line 5 containing a manual throttle valve 38. At low engine speeds, as when the engine is being started or run at low power on the ground, the engine compressor delivery pressure is insufficient to drive the air turbine 71 at a speed at which the centrifugal pump 2 develops the required delivery pressure, the remainder of the required delivery pressure being developed by the positive displacement pump 4. Under these conditions the displacement of the pump 4 exceeds the controlled flow, the excess flow being recirculated to the line 3 by a by-pass valve 22 which is regulated by the pressure difference across the centrifugal pump 2. At higher engine speeds and high flow demand, the controlled flow exceeds the displacement of the positive displacement pump 4, but by then the compressor delivery pressure is sufficient to drive the centrifugal pump 2 at a speed at which it develops the required pressure. The centrifugal pump pressure is then high enough to close the by-pass valve 22 fully, and the excess of centrifugal pump delivery over the displacement of the positive displacement pump 4 is by-passed across the latter through a non-return valve 25. At high altitude and high engine speed, the flow demand is reduced below the displacement of the pump 4, and a servovalve 47 responsive to the pressure drop created across the throttle valve 38 by the flow in the delivery line 5 acts through a servopiston 15 to move a butterfly valve 74 to reduce the speed of the air turbine 71, whereby the pressure developed by the pump 2 is reduced to a level at which it again regulates the opening of the by-pass valve 22. In another embodiment, Fig.2, the excess delivery of the positive displacement pump 119 occurring at low engine speeds is recirculated to the delivery line 121 of the centrifugal pump 110 via a by-pass valve 127, 128. The flow passes to the burners via a valve 125, 126 and a manual metering valve 132, 134 in series. The valves 125, 126 and 127, 128 are combined, with a common spool 124 which is loaded downwardly by a spring 137 seated against the metering valve plug 132 and upwardly by the pressure drop across the metering valve 132, 134, this pressure drop appearing as a pressure difference between the chambers 135 and 139. The valve spool 124 is therefore sensitive to the flow through the metering valve 132, 134 and the position of the metering valve plug 132. The combined pressure drop across the valves 125, 126 and 132, 134 acts on a piston 117 to tend to close the air admission valve 153 of the air turbine 151 during the pump 110. As in the previous embodiment, a non-return valve 141 opens when the flow exceeds the displacement of the positive displacement pump 119.",DOWTY FUEL SYST LTD,TYLER STANLEY RALPH;;ANDREWS DAVID KEITH,,https://lens.org/180-109-535-953-681,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,F04C14/02;;F02C7/236;;F02C9/32;;F02C9/38;;F04D13/04;;F04D13/12;;F04D15/0066,F02C7/236;;F02C9/32;;F02C9/38;;F04C14/02;;F04D13/04;;F04D13/12;;F04D15/00,F1C CD            CD;;F1C C104          CD;;F1C C121          CD;;F1C C2J1D         C2J;;F1C C2J2C1        C2J;;F1C C2J2J3        C2J;;F1C C2J3          C2J;;F1C C504          CD;;F1C C513          CD;;F1C C519          CD;;F1C C521          CD;;F1C C530          CD;;F1C C602          CD;;F1G G10E1B1A      G10E;;F1G G10E2A        G10E;;F1G G10E2X        G10E,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A distributed computer system for implementing a method for managing translations of human language text from a source language to a target language is disclosed. The system comprises a translation management server computer and a translation client computer. Upon notification of a need for translations of source language files of human language text in the source language, the server computer generates a control file including the source language files and a source manifest listing the source language files. The server computer notifies the client computer of the control file whereby the client computer can download the control file. A translator or translation program associated with the client translates the human language text from the source language to a target language, and then the client computer generates a translation file including target language files of the human language text in the target language and a target manifest listing the target language files. The server computer receives the translation file and utilizes the source manifest and the target manifest in ascertaining whether to accept or reject the translation file. When accepting a translation file, the server computer further inspects the target language files for compatibility with a corresponding source language file.

The flight plan filing device provides an electronic form, such as an electronic version of FAA Form 7233-1, which may receive input from a user, such as a pilot of an aircraft. The completed electronic form is then transmitted to an airport server which forwards the form to a regulatory agency server which assigns a transponder code to the flight plan and stores the flight plan in association with the transponder code. The airport server further monitors for transponder signals of aircraft within a predetermined distance of the airport. When the airport server receives a transponder signal, the airport server determines whether the aircraft has landed based on the altitude indicated in the transponder signal. If the aircraft has landed, the airport server attempts to close a flight plan associated with the transponder code sent in the transponder signal by sending a close flight plan message to the regulatory agency server.",IBM,ANDREWS JAMES NEAL;;KUMHYR DAVID BRUCE,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (2003-01-20);;AIRBNB INC (2021-01-06),https://lens.org/122-196-967-668-969,Granted Patent,yes,3,8,2,2,0,G08G5/0013;;G08G5/0039;;G08G5/0082;;G08G5/0013;;G08G5/0039;;G08G5/0082;;Y10S707/99945;;Y10S707/99934,G08G5/00,701/25;;701/14;;701/24;;707/4;;707/104.1;;244/175;;342/36,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A system and method to update weather forecasting using on-board sensing equipment is presented. An aircraft uses onboard sensors to collect atmospheric data during the aircrafts flight. The aircraft's sensors may include an altimeter, a GPS device, a thermometer, and a speedometer. The aircraft may use the collected atmospheric data to calculate other atmospheric measurements, such as changes in atmospheric pressure. The aircraft sends the atmospheric data to a ground station, such as an air traffic control tower, which, in turn, sends the atmospheric data to a weather server. The weather server analyzes the atmospheric data and may send a preferences update to the aircraft which may include an increased atmospheric data transmission interval.

   The present invention provides a system and method for filing and closing of flight plans. With the present invention, a computing device is provided that includes a flight plan filing device that is capable of electronically transmitting a flight plan to an airport server. The flight plan filing device provides an electronic form, such as an electronic version of FAA Form 7233-1, which may receive input from a user, such as a pilot of an aircraft. The completed electronic form is then transmitted to an airport server which forwards the form to a regulatory agency server which assigns a transponder code to the flight plan and stores the flight plan in association with the transponder code. The airport server further monitors for transponder signals of aircraft within a predetermined distance of the airport. When the airport server receives a transponder signal, the airport server determines whether the aircraft has landed based on the altitude indicated in the transponder signal. If the aircraft has landed, the airport server attempts to close a flight plan associated with the transponder code sent in the transponder signal by sending a close flight plan message to the regulatory agency server.

The 9 alpha -carbonates are prepared by reaction of the corresponding 9 alpha -hydroxy steroid with a sequence of excess base, trialkylsilyl chloride, alkyl haloformate and alkanol or by using excess base, alkyl haloformate and alkoxide. 9 alpha -Carbonate-17-keto compounds can be treated with lithium acetylide and a lithium salt to afford the corresponding 17 alpha -ethynyl-17 beta -hydroxy-9 alpha -carbonate. This compound is then esterified with a novel series of reagents to give the 17-ester which can be reduced the corresponding 17-allene. Oxidation of this allene to the bis-epoxide compound, followed by treatment with an alkali metal salt of a carboxylic acid under phase transfer conditions gives the 17 alpha -hydroxy 21-ester 9 alpha -carbonate. Elimination of the 9 alpha -carbonate group affords the a 17 alpha -hydroxy, 9(11)ene, which in a few subsequent steps can be converted to a variety of commercially important corticosteroids.

   Disclosed is an implantable, intravascular device for treating a medical disorder associated with the presence of a particular molecule in the systemic circulation of a mammal. When implanted, the device removes or reduces the concentration of the molecule in the blood stream thereby conditioning the blood. The device includes an anchor component immobilizable to an inner wall of an intact blood vessel and a cartridge component that is retained in place within the blood vessel by the immobilized anchor. The cartridge contains a converting agent, for example, viable cells or enzyme preparations, that catabolize or convert the molecule of interest into one or more other molecules that are not associated with the disorder. The invention also provides a minimally or non-invasive method for introducing into and, optionally, removing from the blood vessel the device of the invention.

    A light source with multiple parallel beams is combined with a pair of opposing mirrors mounted on a rotating fixture and with a fixed aperture to produce a single output beam. Through the motion of the rotating fixture, the pair of mirrors shifts the location of the output of each input beam passing through the device so as to sequentially channel each beam into the optical path defined by the aperture. Thus, the input source corresponding to the output beam may be quickly switched by rotating the pair of mirrors to the position that produces the appropriate shift of the beam selected from the light source. In another embodiment of the invention, the pair of opposing mirrors is replaced by a transparent block similarly mounted on a rotating fixture.

   A light source with multiple parallel beams is combined with a pair of opposing mirrors mounted on a rotating fixture and with a fixed aperture to produce a single output beam. Through the motion of the rotating fixture, the pair of mirrors shifts the location of the output of each input beam passing through the device so as to sequentially channel each beam into the optical path defined by the aperture. Thus, the input source corresponding to the output beam may be quickly switched by rotating the pair of mirrors to the position that produces the appropriate shift of the beam selected from the light source. In another embodiment of the invention, the pair of opposing mirrors is replaced by a transparent block similarly mounted on a rotating fixture.

The arrangement permits of a substantial flow through the valve 25 during normal operation of the engine without sacrificing sensitivity of control by the valve 47 which opens only during abnormal running conditions. As shown, two pumps 1, 2 are driven through gearing 6 by a gas turbine engine and discharge into a common fuel delivery pipe 4 having a throttle 5. The valve 25 is loaded by a spring 29 and actuated by an evacuated bellows 31 subject to barometric pressure and a diaphragm 34 subject to the fuel delivery pressure. Two valves 47, one for each pump, are opened by a diaphragm 43 subject to the delivery pressure of a centrifugal impeller 37 upon the attainment of an excessive engine speed.
