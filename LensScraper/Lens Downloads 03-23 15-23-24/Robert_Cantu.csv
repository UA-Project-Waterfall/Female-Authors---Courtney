The invention is a highly shock absorbent, lightweight, portable batting aid, which is inexpensive to make, and provides an easy, fatigue-resistant use. The invention comprises a composite apparatus consisting of all shock-absorbent lightweight components, comprising a handle at one end and a golf-size ball at the other. The result of the shock absorbency properties, negligible weight, and arrangement of the parts of the invention is that, while grasping the invention by the handle, while the ball is being repeatedly hit with the bat, the user will not experience fatigue from the weight of the apparatus or repeated impacts of the bat. The invention is small and lightweight enough to fit inside the typical batting bag. Another advantage is that to use this invention, the user merely grasps the apparatus by the handle, holding the apparatus in one position, thereby reducing fatigue of the user which would result from having to swing the apparatus.",CANTU ROGER;;ALEMAN ROBERT,CANTU ROGER;;ALEMAN ROBERT,,https://lens.org/172-767-107-507-399,Patent Application,yes,15,26,1,1,0,A63B69/0002;;A63B69/0002;;A63B2069/0008;;A63B2069/0008;;A63B2208/12;;A63B2208/12,A63B69/00,473/422;;473/424;;473/451;;473/453,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

    Fluid processing systems and methods make use of a replenishable source containing a volume of a processing fluid that is dispensed during a processing period. A processor serves to sequentially pause and resume the processing period. The processor records weight values of the source at commencement of the processing period; upon pauses in the processing period; and upon resumptions of the processing period. At termination of the processing period, the processor generates a total volume value of processing fluid dispensed from the source during the processing period, which takes into account replenishment of the processing fluid when the processing period is paused. The systems and methods can be integrated into blood processing circuits to monitor the introduction of anticoagulant.

   Blood processing systems and methods rotate a processing chamber on a rotating element. The processing chamber includes a first compartment and a second compartment. Blood is conveyed into the first compartment for centrifugal separation into components. A liquid free of blood occupies the second compartment to counter-balance the first compartment during rotation on the rotating element. In one embodiment, the second compartment is served by a single fluid flow access. Prior to use, the single access is coupled to tubing, through which a vacuum is drawn to remove air from the second compartment. While the vacuum exists, communication is opened between the tubing and a source of liquid. The vacuum draws the liquid into the second compartment through the single access, thereby priming the second compartment for use.

   Systems and methods for treating bone employ an expandable body sized to be inserted into bone over a guide wire, without need of an access cannula, and undergo expansion in cancellous bone to compact cancellous bone. The systems and methods further include one or more other instruments sized to pass over the guide wire. The other instruments can comprise, e.g., a cannula, or a device for injecting material into bone. The systems and methods can make use of a special guide wire assembly that includes a guide wire having an enlarged component or tip element on its distal end that can be used to engage the distal end of a bone treatment tool in response to a pulling motion on the guide wire. The pulling motion on the guide wire serves to withdraw the bone treatment tool. The enlarged component or tip element on the distal end of the guide wire can enable the withdrawal of an inner centering body from an outer cannula body after deployment. After withdrawal of the inner body, the outer body can be used, e.g., to guide a bone treatment tool into a bone, or to convey material into bone

The perfusion device is configured for installation into a blood vessel such as a left anterior descending coronary artery through an incision therein, to which is to be grafted a distal end of a blood vessel such as an internal mammary artery. The device includes a central member of selected configuration and material, terminating at either end thereof in respective selectively tapered end members. A lumen extending through the central member and end members, and selected perforations in the end members, maintain blood flow through the perfusion device.

SOLUTION: A basic shunt is composed of a central member 22 with a lumen 24 for passing of blood passing a shunt shown by an arrow mark 26, and formed by a material such as polyurethane, polyethylene, silicone, etc. The shunt is, for instance, guided into the left anterior descending artery (LAD) 30 to be hung on a left anterior artery discission part or a discission part 32 of the LAD 30 to form a position for anastomosis construction. So as to accept a vascular flow 26 passing through the LAD 30 and, on the other hand, to maintain the anastomosis position corresponding to the discission part 32 in a condition without blood, the shunt 20 has an outer diameter exactly to fit in the inner wall of the LAD 30 on guiding in.",CARDIOTHORACIC SYST INC,TAYLOR CHARLES S;;CANTU ALFRED R;;GIA SON M;;KROLIK JEFF A;;MATHENY ROBERT G;;SALAHIEH AMR;;SEPETKA IVAN,,https://lens.org/163-943-771-200-225,Patent Application,no,0,4,18,20,0,A61B17/0469;;A61B17/11;;A61B17/12045;;A61B17/12109;;A61B17/12131;;A61B17/12136;;A61B17/1219;;A61B2017/1135;;A61B2017/12127;;A61B17/12045;;A61B17/11;;A61B17/12109;;A61B17/12131;;A61B17/12136;;A61B2017/12127;;A61B17/11;;A61B2017/12127;;A61B17/12131;;A61B17/12109;;A61B17/0469;;A61B2017/1135;;A61B17/12136;;A61B17/12045;;A61B17/1219,A61B17/04;;A61B17/00;;A61B17/11;;A61B17/12,,0,0,,,,PENDING
