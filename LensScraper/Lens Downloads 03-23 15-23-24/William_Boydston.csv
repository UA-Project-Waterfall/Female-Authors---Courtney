The collision avoidance system may comprise a secondary perception component that may receive sensor data, receive and/or determine a corridor associated with operation of a vehicle, classify a portion of the sensor data associated with the corridor as either ground or an object, determine a position and/or velocity of at least the nearest object, determine a threshold distance associated with the vehicle, and control the vehicle based at least in part on the position and/or velocity of the nearest object and the threshold distance.",ZOOX INC,WANG CHUANG;;COHEN JOSHUA KRISER;;PHILBIN JAMES WILLIAM VAISEY;;BOYDSTON JACOB DANIEL;;XIE YUESONG;;REN HANG;;ZHANG YUAN,ZOOX INC (2019-09-27),https://lens.org/076-071-504-405-323,Patent Application,yes,3,14,6,6,0,B60W30/09;;B60W30/0953;;B60W30/0956;;B60W60/0011;;B60W2552/00;;B60W2552/15;;B60W2552/20;;B60W2552/25;;B60W2552/30;;B60W2554/40;;B60W2554/4041;;B60W2554/4042;;B60W30/0953;;B60W30/0956;;B60W60/0011;;B60W2552/00;;B60W2554/40;;B60W2554/4041;;B60W2554/4042;;B60W2552/15;;B60W2552/20;;B60W2552/25;;B60W2552/30;;B60W30/09;;G05D1/0212;;G05D1/0231;;G05D1/0255;;G05D1/0257;;G06N3/08;;G08G1/16,G05D1/02;;G08G1/16,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
