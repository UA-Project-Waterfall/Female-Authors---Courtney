Berry, J., and Berry, F. Aug. 17. Rope grips.-Consists of a clip or grip for cable haulage in collieries &c., and of means for automatically releasing the same. Figs. 1 and 4 show the clip, and Fig. 5 the releaser. Pivoted in a body piece a are jaws e, e<1> the lower ends of which embrace the cable. A top jaw h slides in slots in the piece a. The jaws e, e<1> are weighted so that when free of the cable they open, but when the clip is placed on the rope the jaw h separates the top parts of the jaws e, e<1> enough to allow the thin part of the wedge-shaped cam-lever c, d to enter between them. On then depressing this lever, the edge of the cam engages the inclined top of the jaw h, and its sides the jaws e, e', and all three jaws are thus closed on the cable. The releaser comprises a trough k with a supporting-roller l for the cable, and a pivoted cross-arm n on to which the cam lever c, d passes to be lifted. An incline o on the clip raises the arm n to allow of the passage of the clip, after which the arm drops again to its operative position.",BERRY JOHN;;BERRY FASCUTT,BERRY JOHN;;BERRY FASCUTT,,https://lens.org/045-691-900-515-666,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

[Also in Group XIII] The flow of water to an instantaneous heater is controlled by two valves, one responsive to water pressure and the other to the temperature of the water in the stream. The water supply fed at 15 passes through a port controlled by a valve member 19 which is connected to a diaphragm 10. Water then flows past a valve 27 and pipe 36 to the heated tubes, shown diagrammatically at 33. The diaphragm is subjected on one side to the water pressure downstream of the valve 19 and on the other side to a spring loading 44 and water pressure downstream of the valve 27 fed through a small pipe 25 whereby a constant pressure drop is maintained across the valve 27. The valve 27 is adjusted by a bellows 32 filled with a liquid and connected to a bulb 30 preferably located near the heated water outlet, e.g. in the last limb of a zig-zag arrangement of heating tube. The diaphragm may also control a gas valve 42 supplying the burners. A stop 39 may be provided to limit the closure of valve 27 to allow a small flow, when the heater is cold, to open the gas valve.",MAIN WATER HEATERS LTD,BERRY JOHN EDWIN,,https://lens.org/055-297-841-173-308,Granted Patent,no,0,2,2,2,0,F23N1/087;;F24H9/2035;;F24H9/2035,F16K31/68;;F23N1/08;;F24H9/20,F2V VA30          VA30;;F2V VLZ2          VLZ2;;F2V VT19          VT4A;;F4A AC            AC/COMBS;;F4A A100          AC/COMBS;;F4A A103          AC/COMBS,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

AMERICAN CYANAMID CO. 19 Jan., 1967 [9 Feb., 1966], No. 2971/67. Heading C4S. [Also in Division G4] A record such as a cheque or card has symbols, e.g. legible characters, recorded thereon by means of a combination of at least one material which fluoresces under ultraviolet radiation and at least one material reflecting any or none of the visible colours red, green and blue. The symbols may be sensed by spatially separating the fluoresecent and visible portions of a symbol and simultaneously irradiating the respective portions with ultraviolet and white light, there being an appropriate number of photodetectors responding to the various fluorescent and reflected colours. Alternatively, the two symbol portions may overlap, and the symbol is sequentially illuminated with ultraviolet and white light. In this case, it may be possible to use the same detectors for both portions, the threshold level for sensing visible marks being higher than that for sensing fluorescent marks.

Dec. 15, 1960 [Dec. 16, 1959], No. 42864/59. Class 81 (2). A knee joint for an artificial leg has means by which, on returning to a straight position, the movement is free over the greater part of its range, but has a controlled resistance applied to it over a small angle before the straight position is reached. The control is effected hydraulically and the joint comprises a radial vane 8, mounted on an axle 4 and rotated within a cylindrical casing 1 by the shin member, the casing being attached to the thigh. The casing is filled with oil and, over the greater part of the movement of the vane 8, oil is free to pass around its outer end. Towards the end of its movement, however, the vane passes adjacent to an arcuate plate 14 which causes the oil to pass through orifices 15 and one-way valves 16, causing a slight resistance to the freedom of movement. Finally, over the last few degrees of straightening the knee, the orifices bear against and are closed by spring- loaded balls 17. The springs 19 permit displacement of the balls, and final straightening of the leg, but during this arc of movement the oil is forced through a duct 13 which is adjustably restricted by a needle valve.

July 9, 1964 [July 25, 1963], No. 29590/63. Heading H1W. The waveguide transition of Specification 805,510, for transforming the TE 01 rectangular mode to the TE 01 circular mode, improved in that it is dimensioned in such a manner that the guided wavelength is constant over the length of the transition within the transmission frequency band. The known transition comprises a first section a in which a rectangular input end 5 is transformed by a double taper to a rectangular output end lying at right angles to the input end and having a major dimension twice that of the input end. This is followed by a section b transforming between a rectangular input end and a symmetrical cruciform output end and by a section c in which the cruciform section is transformed to a circular section. The first section may be improved by spacing the start of one of the tapers from the end of the section, e.g. at the position 6, whereby it extends over three-quarters the length of the section. Both tapers may be modified in this way and the tapers may be curved, e.g. according to a cos<SP>2</SP> curve. The first section is preferably three wavelengths long. A further method of improving the first section consists in so dimensioning the L-shaped symmetrical halves of the transition that they have a constant cut-off frequency at any section preferably equal to the cut-off frequency of the initial section 5. The dimensions of the cruciform section are such that the width d (minor dimension) of the arms is smaller than the value given by the equation # h =d.2#2, where # h is the free-space wavelength corresponding to the highest operating frequency. Preferably, the diameter of the circular output end of the third section is made greater than the longer side of the output end of the first section and this increase of dimension may be achieved either by a progressive increase extending over the whole transition or over only the third section.",MARCONI CO LTD,BERRY JOHN ALFRED,,https://lens.org/131-026-665-406-52X,Granted Patent,no,0,5,1,1,0,H01P5/082,H01P5/08,H1W WHA           WHA;;H1W W4A           -;;H1W W4C           -;;H1W W4D           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Optical direction-finding; transistor gating circuits. ELECTRIC & MUSICAL INDUSTRIES Ltd. 26 Jan., 1962 [3 Feb., 1961], No. 4254/61. Headings H3T and H4D. Apparatus for tracking a radiating bodymoving relative to the apparatus comprises a first lattice of elongated parallel radiationsensitive elements, a second lattice of elongated parallel radiation-sensitive elements at right angles to the first, means for focusing radiation on the two lattices from substantially the same point of view, first and second sampling means for sampling the elements of the two lattices respectively in predetermined manner to determine which, if any, of the elements is sensitized by radiation, and output means responsive to the sampling means to produce an output signal dependent on the direction of the radiating body relative to the tracking apparatus. Referring to Fig. 1, infra-red radiation emitted by a target is sampled by a mechanical chopper (not shown) and focused by a Schmitt optical system 1 on to two lattices 2 of infra-red sensitive cells carried by the missile. (Only one lattice 2 and its circuit is shown in Fig. 1). Each cell is scanned in turn by a series of switches or gates 3 controlled by a counter 4, and only that.cell on which radiation is focused will produce an output, the particular cell being determined by the angular position of the radiation source. This output is applied to a high-pass filter 5, amplifier 6 and blanking circuit 7 which cuts out components of the switching pulses; after passing through amplifier 9 the signal is detected at 10 to .reduce the A.C. component due to the mechanical chopper and applied to a Schmitt trigger circuit 11 which provides a fixed output whenever the signal rises above a predetermined value. The switches 3 are normally operated sequentially by a ring counter 4 which is driven by pulses from the counter control unit 8 via the counter driver 12. The counter control unit 8 produces driving pulses only when no signal is produced by unit 11. When a signal appears, e.g. from cell "" x,"" the counter control unit 8, and hence the counter 4, stops and cell "" x "" remains connected to the output line as long as it is producing a signal. If the signal disappears, the unit 8 produces a drive pulse which stops the counter 4 in the direction in which it was last moving, for example to the (x + 1)<SP>th</SP> stage; if there is still no signal the unit 8 in conjunction with reversal unit 13 rapidly reverses the counter 4 two stages to the (x - 1)<SP>th</SP> stage and if there is still no signal the counter proceeds to count in this direction. The counter 4 is connected to a digital to analogue converter 14 whereby the count number at any instant is converted to a voltage proportional to the coordinate value. The signal from 14 is applied to a computer (not shown) and may, if desired, be gated into the computer by the "" target present "" signal from unit 11. A second input to the computer is derived from the second lattice to give the position of the target relative to the missile in two directions at right angles, and from these two values the computer calculates the angle of sight and its rate of change and hence the optimum moment of detonation. Blanking circuit.-The blanking circuit, Fig. 2, comprises a transistor T connected across a tuned circuit C 3 L 4 of which the centre tap of the coil L 4 is earthed to A.C. When T is cut off the coil L 4 behaves as an autotransformer and the signal is simply inverted in passing from the input amplifier 6 to the output amplifier 9. When T conducts the signal is fed to both halves of coil L 4 simultaneously and cancels out. Ring counter.-The ring counter shown in Fig. 3 comprises a number of stages each including a four-layer PNPN semi-conductor diode S connected to one of the lines ABC which are energized in sequence by means not shown. The potential applied to lines ABC is insufficient to cause conduction through a diode but sufficient to maintain conduction. When the circuit is switched on means are provided to ensure that one and only one diode will conduct (for example a non-linear impedance may be connected between the negative potential source and the junction of resistances RC1, RC2, RC3 ...). If line B is energized and diode S2 is conducting, the condensers C associated with diodes S1 and S3 are charged through diodes DB; this charge enables diode S1 or S3 to conduct if line B is de-energized and line A or C energized. Thus the stages can be energized in sequence in either direction according to the sequence of energization of lines AB and C.",EMI LTD,BERRY PETER JOHN;;THOMPSON BERNARD JOHN,,https://lens.org/143-240-891-942-841,Granted Patent,no,0,7,2,2,0,F42C13/02;;G01J1/4214;;G01J1/4214;;F42C13/02,F42C13/02;;G01J1/42,H3T TCX           TCX;;H3T T1C1          -;;H3T T2B9          TCX;;H3T T2F2          -;;H3T T2F4          -;;H3T T2F5          -;;H3T T2P           -;;H3T T2T3J         -;;H3T T2W2          -;;H3T T2X           -;;H3T T3V           TCX;;H3T T3V1          -;;H3T T4S           -;;H4D D716          L;;H4D D746          L;;H4D D763          L;;H4D D774          L;;H4D D775          L;;H4D D781          L;;H4D D782          L,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Yarns and threads. COURTAULDS Ltd. Nov. 11, 1958 [Nov. 12, 1957], No. 35178/57. Class 120(3) [Also in Group XXXIV] A composite cord for use as circumferential reinforcement of the crowns of tyres consists of a ""destructible"" textile core around which is helically wound a tyre cord. The core, and consequently the composite cord, has a high initial modulus but the breaking extension of the core is less than the increase in the circumference of the base of the tread of the tyre occasioned by the shaping thereof. The remanent cord in the finished tyre has a high initial modulus. The core may be a staple fibre yarn of cotton and/or viscose rayon or continuous filaments, e.g. bulked, yarn and the helically wound cord may be a high tenacity, continuous filament, rayon, nylon or polyethylene terephthalate yarn. The tyre cord may be initially over-twisted and then back-twisted during the winding on the core so that the final fully extended cord has twist which is normal in tyre cords.

Phythian, J., and Berry, A. E. Feb. 2. Mechanical stoking; fire-bars and grates; linings.-Fuel is fed to a reciprocating grate of special construction by means of a special form of rotary feeder located in the base of a hopper. A protective, metallic, removable lining is provided at the mouth of the furnace. As shown in Fig. 2, the fuel hopper c is provided with a bridge c"" with inclined sides to direct the fuel to openings c<1> which are controlled by a slide e actuated by a screwed shaft e<11>, working in nuts upon the slide and rotated by bevel-gear g<1>. The fuel is fed to the furnace by the rotary drum i, which is provided with blades i<1> of the form shown in Fig. 1. A distributing . plate f, kept cool by water and provided with ribs, directs the fuel on to the coking-plate j, which may also be ribbed. Motion is given to the rotary drum i by worm gearing mounted on the vertical shaft l and drum shaft. The shaft l receives motion from worm gear and spur gear n' driven from a shaft n<11> provided with pulleys n<111>. The vertical shaft l is also provided with worm gearing for giving motion to the cam shaft w, which is provided with cams w<1>, w<11> for giving a reciprocating motion to the fire-bars. The latter are arranged in two sets or series r, r', Fig. 4, those in one set or section alternating with those in the other section. The bars in each section are connected by crossbars s, s' secured to their respective side bars t, t<1>, which are provided at their front ends with suitable projections u, u<1>, u<11>, u<111> and recesses v, v<1>, Fig. 5. The cam-surface w<1> is in advance of the cam-surface w<11>, and, during each revolution, strikes the shoulders u on the side-bars t and moves the latter towards the front of the furnace, while the cam w<11>, subsequently, by striking the shoulders u<1>, moves the bars t<1> in the same direction. The backward movement of the bars r is effected by the cam w<1>engaging with the feet u<11> on the bars t. The feet u<11> are also provided with lateral projections, as shown in Fig. 6, which, as the bars t move backwards, engage the feet u<111>on the bars t<1>, whereupon the two sets of bars move back together. The fire-bars are stepped and inclined as shown and ride upon a roller x to facilitate motion. The protective metallic lining for the furnace mouth is shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Each side lining comprises two suitably-shaped castings or blocks o, o' of metal, one o of which is provided with longitudinal grooves p having lateral extensions at rightangles to receive projections p<1> upon the block o'. Each block may be grooved, in which case a bolt with a flange or the like is employed to enter the grooves and hold the blocks together, and also secure them to the boiler front. The blocks may also be secured to the furnace front by bolts q.

Locks, key.-The mechanism and the keyhole in the case are capable of lateral adjustment, so that the lock may be used to replace another without cutting a fresh keyhole in the door, box, &c. to which the lock is applied. A D-shaped hole, shown in dotted lines in Fig. 1, is cut in the front plate of the lock and covered by a keyhole plate B, which can be adjusted by a screw b. A tumbler C, Fig. 3, having projections c to enable it to be operated by a key, is adjustably secured to the bolt D by a screw c<2> and slot d in the bolt, which is thus operated through the tumbler. A stump c<1> on the tumbler projects through a slot d' in the bolt, and engages a lever E which is pivoted on the keyhole plate and holds the bolt in the retracted or shot positions. The rear end of the bolt is guided by a pin d<4> on the case. To attach the lock the case is placed in position, and the keyhole is made to register by moving the keyhole plate. The position of the bolt relatively to the tumbler is then adjusted by the screw c<2>. Fig. 6 shows the arrangement for a night latch. The position of the spring bolt is adjusted relatively to the tumbler I by a screw L' bearing against a projection i on the tumbler, the key operating the bolt, in one direction only, through the tumbler.

Berry, J., Glover, W. T., and Meters, Ltd. Sept. 30. Gas-meters.-In registering-mechanism for gas and like meters of the type in which means are employed to compensate for differences in pressure, the compensating-means is controlled by a weight adapted to move angularly to balance the gas pressure. As shown in Fig. 1, a supplementary movement is given to the differential gear train of the registering mechanism by pawls h, i carried by a bar g connected to a plunger c which is reciprocated by a crank d and connecting-rod e through a spring f. The extent of movement of the plunger c is controlled by a curved striking-plate b carried by a lever p connected by a link to a sliding member o. The sliding member o is connected through a lever n to a diaphragm a and by a chain q to a quadrant r secured to an arm s provided with a weight t. An increase in the pressure of the gas acts through the diaphragm a and connected parts to move the striking- plate b and to move the weight t angularly to increase its leverage. In a modification, the weight t is carried by the striking-plate b. Specification 7727/11 is referred to. The Provisional Specification also states that a piston under the influence of the gas pressure may cause a wheel to mesh with any one of a series of wheels or with parts of a wheel with numbers of teeth removed at different points.",BERRY JOHN;;GLOVER WILLIAM THOMAS,BERRY JOHN;;GLOVER WILLIAM THOMAS,,https://lens.org/054-288-256-464-349,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,G01F15/04,G01F15/04,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The method involves displaying to the text processing system operator a menu of data type codes selectable through a keyboard for defining the types of data fields in a record. In response to operator selected field types, structured fields of fixed length (41) and address pointers of fixed length for the string fields are established for the records. When the data is keyed in, the structured fields are concatenated with the string field address pointers and the text data (43), including format control codes, is stored at a system selected address in a variable length section of an auxiliary storage device such as a disk file.

Protective arrangements. J. STONE & CO. (DEPTFORD) Ltd. 19 April, 1966 [26 April, 1965], No. 17401/65. Heading H2K. An arrangement for protecting semi-conductor apparatus comprises a thyristor 3 connected across the supply to the apparatus and a Zener diode 4 or other device connected to the apparatus and responsive to overvoltage conditions to apply a control signal to the thyristor to render it conducting to short-circuit the apparatus. A fuse 7 is then blown, or an automatic circuit-breaker is operated, by the shortcircuit current to interrupt the supply to the apparatus. As shown, the Zener diode 4 is connected in series with a resistor 5 across the supply to the apparatus 1 and, in the event of overvoltage, conducts. The voltage across the resistor 5 is applied to the gate of the thyristor 3 through a variable resistor 6 to render the thyristor 3 conducting, a slight delay being provided by capacitors 9 to prevent undesired operation under transient conditions. Should the supply be alternating current, then diodes 10, 11 are connected as shown. Figs. 2 and 3 (not shown), illustrate the application of the arrangement to the field circuits of a D.C. generator and an alternator. By providing a further Zener diode 4 and resistor 5 the arrangement may be connected to provide overcurrent protection.

When the target object (124) is on another page (125) of the notebook, the user selects the source object (123). The user then flips the notebook page. During the page flipping, the selected source object is shown as an outline shadow with a page number (P1) under it. If the new page is shown with the desired target object on it, the user drags and drops a link (127) between the shadow source object and the target object to make a connection. If the user flips to the source object page, then the target object will become the shadow object with a page number label next to it. If the shadow object is too big and covers the target object completely or for any other reason, the user may want to optionally use the outside page connector technique. This can be done by dragging and dropping the link from the source object to any point outside the notebook. The ending point of the link (outside the notebook) will have an outside page connector ICON appear. The user flips the notebook to find the target object. After the target object page is displayed, the user draws a link from the outside page connector to the target object.

Transistor amplitude-discriminating circuits; pilot-controlled A.V.C. GENERAL ELECTRIC CO. Ltd. Oct. 23, 1963 [Nov. 1, 1962], No. 41377/62. Headings H3T and H4R. A circuit for producing a predetermined response when the voltage level of an input signal (e.g. a pilot signal in a communication system) falls outside defined limits, comprises two bi-stable trigger circuits one of which changes state when the input signal voltage increases positively to exceed a first voltage level but which does not return to its initial state until the input signal has fallen below a level less positive than the first voltage level and the other of which changes state when the input signal voltage increases negatively to exceed a second voltage level but which does not return to its initial state until the input signal has fallen below a level less negative than the second voltage level. Thus both trigger circuits remain in their initial states so long as the input signal voltage remains within the limits defined by the first and second voltage levels; however, once a circuit has changed state its state is not restored until the input signal voltage has returned to within limits narrower than those defined by the first and second voltage levels. The circuit may form part of terminal receiving equipment in which a pilot signal transmitted with the intelligence signal is used to effect gain control, the circuit serving to indicate when excessive changes on the pilot-signal amplitude, such as would be due to a fault, have taken place. The two bi-stable circuits 43, 44 comprise Schmitt-trigger circuits constituted by transistors 2, 6 and 13, 16 respectively and so biased that for input-signals levels within the defined limits, transistors 6 and 13 are conducting. The circuit 44 includes an inverting output transistor 24, so that for normal levels of input signal, the output transistors 6 and 24 of the circuits 43, 44 are both conducting. The outputs from the two trigger circuits are applied via diode gates 11, 28 to emitter-follower transistor 29; thus for normal input-signal levels both transistors 31 and 36 are conducting and relay 39 is energized. Reversal of the state of either of the bi-stable circuits results in a considerably more negative voltage being established at the base of emitter follower 29, this switching transistors 31 and 36 and so releasing relay 39 to cause an alarm to be operated and/or some other control to be effected. Transistor 22 forms part of the load for transistor 13 and serves to delay the onset of bottoming in that transistor.",GEN ELECTRIC CO LTD,BERRY ALLAN DAVID;;BURCOMBE JOHN EDWARD,,https://lens.org/013-284-633-196-779,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H04B3/10,H04B3/10,H3P PPTE          PPTE;;H3T TE            TE;;H3T T1CX          -;;H3T T1M2P         -;;H3T T2A1N         -;;H3T T2A2          -;;H3T T2B2          -;;H3T T2B3          -;;H3T T2J           -;;H3T T2M           -;;H3T T2T3J         -;;H3T T3C1          -;;H3T T3E           -;;H3T T3N           -;;H3T T3X           -;;H3T T4C           -;;H3T T4D           -;;H3T T4E1N         -;;H3T T4E2N         -;;H3T T4G           -;;H3T T4M           -;;H3T T5E           -;;H4R R18A1         -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The guides 1 and 2 are held together by a sleeve 4, the guide 2 in Fig. 1 being a helical guide 2a in a sheath 2b of synthetic material. In the construction shown in Figs. 1 and 3 the grooving la is in the form of internal ring triangular grooves, in a solid walled grade, which are of a depth and/or width which is increased from groove to groove towards the end of the guide or of a depth and/or width which is increased from group of grooves to group of grooves towards the end of the guide. Alternatively the grooving can be in the form of a screw thread of increasing depth and/or width towards the end of the guide. In the construction shown in Fig. 2 the guide 2 consists of a metal helix 2c whose turns are in contact contained in a sheath 2b of synthetic material, the metal helix being formed of metal wire or strip the cross-sectional dimensions of which are reduced, either gradually or in steps, over a length at one end of the guide. In the construction shown in Fig. 3 the flexible guide 2 is built up of metal rings 2d spaced by rings 2e of dielectric material. The desired gradual variation of surface impedance, which may be effected in a solid walled guide or a flexible guide, or in both, can be in accordance with a linear, binormal or exponential law.",MARCONI CO LTD,SCHELISCH ERNST FRIEDRICH;;BERRY JOHN ALFRED,,https://lens.org/104-896-904-040-386,Granted Patent,no,0,0,3,4,0,H01P5/082;;H01P5/082,H01P5/08,H1W WFA           WFA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

An operator equipped with a receiver (18) having a communications probability indicator (22) (Figures 2 and 3 (not shown)) proceeds from one elemental area to the next, either on foot or in a vehicle, monitoring a particular characteristic of the transmitted signal and the number of occurrences of that characteristic within a predetermined sampling period in each elemental area, thereby determining the quality of reception of that characteristic. This characteristic may be either the carrier strength or SINAD (the ratio of the [signal plus noise plus distortion] to [noise plus distortion]).

The separation of competing anions by the separation subsystem increases the treatment capacity of the anion exchange resin to remove PFAS from the contaminated water.,EMERGING COMPOUNDS TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES INC,WOODARD STEVEN;;NICKELSEN MICHAEL;;BERRY JOHN,,https://lens.org/156-766-915-605-937,Patent Application,no,0,0,5,5,0,B01D15/363;;C02F1/42;;C02F2001/422;;C02F2101/36;;B01D61/08;;B01D61/18;;B01D2311/2623;;C02F1/442;;C02F1/444;;B01J41/05;;B01J41/14;;B01J49/07;;C02F1/42;;B01D15/363;;B01D61/145;;C02F2103/007;;C02F9/00;;C02F2001/422;;C02F2101/36;;B01D61/04,B01D15/00;;C02F1/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

[Also in Divisions B2 and C3] A fibrous web of sheet material such as paper or a textile fibre, which may be in the form of a woven fabric or a non-woven fabric may be impregnated with a material comprising the reaction product of (a) a polymer of one or more episulphides having at least two reactive terminal groups and (b) a potentially thermosetting aminoplast by spraying, brushing, spreading and especially dipping techniques and composite laminate structures may subsequently be formed and if desired a layer of a non-fibrous material such as a strip of aluminium or other heat-resistant material may be included to confer heat-resistant properties on the impregnated fibrous material. The fibrous layers may be united together before the impregnating material is applied or they may be non-united layers which are united by the impregnating material itself giving a flexible composite fabric. Layers of fibrous web may be mechanically locked together, for example, by needling, or they may be impregnated and laminated together by means of conventional laminating resins, for example, aminoplastics or phenolin resins and the top web is then impregnated with the impregnating material giving a laminate, which is not usually flexible, having a working surface very resistant to alkali and to chipping. Drying of the impregnated fibrous web is effected at room temperature or at 70-80 C. and curing may be effected at 140-200 C. while the coated web is compressed between press platens. The examples describe the formation of laminates whereby both surfaces of a decorative paper web are coated with the impregnating material and also both surfaces of a white overlay paper web are similarly coated and the two coated webs air-dried, superimposed and pressed together for 10 minutes at 180 C. between chromium plates previously coated with a silicone release agent. The resulting sheet materials may be provided with a backing of adhesive, which may be covered with a release paper. The cured surfaces are resistant to staining by household liquids and cleaners.

   A self-tapping fastener or fastening peg secures a weatherseal to a mounting surface of an automotive vehicle. A pointed, conical nose pierces the weatherseal to form an opening. In the preferred embodiment, the fastening peg is rotated at a first velocity as it is axially advanced toward the weatherseal to create an opening. The fastening peg is further axially advanced and rotated at a second velocity to advance a first flange through the pierced opening, thereby securing the fastening peg to the weatherseal. The weatherseal is then secured to a vehicle mounting surface by advancing a locking assembly through a pre-formed opening in the mounting surface.

The protection circuit needs to handle an extremely large power: namely all the power supplied to the anode. The invention overcomes this problem by using two voltage sources (1, 9) one (1) of which provides carrier power whilst the other (9) drives a pulse width modulation amplifier (8) which modulates the carrier. Varying demand for power to the amplifier (8) thus does not effect the carrier. Therefore carrier compression is reduced. Also, only that voltage source (9) which feeds the amplifier needs a sophisticated fast acting protection system (11, 12) and since this does not supply all of the power to the anode the protection system is able to operate reliably.",MARCONI CO LTD,MOLYNEUX-BERRY ROBERT BEWES;;BRETT JOHN EDWARD,,https://lens.org/107-952-225-551-363,Patent Application,yes,8,2,3,9,0,H03F3/24;;H03C1/16,H03C1/16;;H03F3/24,,1,0,,,"TECHNISCHE MITTEILUNG AEG-TELEFUNKEN, vol. 69, no. 3, 1979, B.

The thus-immersed circuit is then subjected to a reduced-pressure testing environment to draw air and other retained gases out of internal voids within the encapsulated circuit. The pressure of the testing environment is slowly increased to cause the encapsulated circuit to ingest a quantity of the evaluating fluid. An input signal is then applied to the circuit and the circuit's response to the input signal is monitored over a predetermined time period.,MC DONNELL DOUGLAS CORP,BERRY JOHN C JR;;FOGG LARRY L,,https://lens.org/197-066-539-707-031,Patent Application,no,0,0,9,9,0,G01R31/2849;;G01R31/2849,G01R31/28,,0,0,,,,PATENTED

The dispersion of the urea/formaldehyde resin, in which the mol. ratio of urea to formaldehyde may be 1 : 2-3, may contain a softening agent for the regenerated cellulose, e.g. glycerine. Examples disclose the production of dispersions (1) by refluxing at 98 DEG C. a mixture of urea or thiourea, formaldehyde, sodium acetate and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, adding acetic acid to pH 5, cooling, and neutralizing to pH7 by caustic soda solution, and (2) by proceding as at (1) above with the addition of ethanol to the reaction mixture. Vinylidene chloride may be copolymerized with one or more of the following: acrylonitrile, vinyl chloride or acetate, styrene, ethyl acrylate, methyl or n-butyl methacrylate. The production of dispersions of vinylidene chloride/acrylonitrile is described in Specification 655,732. Long-chain alkyl sulphates may also be used as dispersing agents. After formation, the dispersion is acidified to pH 1-4 by citric, acetic, hydrochloric, &c. acid, or sulphur dioxide, or by ageing the dispersion under conditions which favour hydrolytic evolution of hydrochloric acid. Examples describe the preparation of dispersions (1) by copolymerizing at 45 DEG C. an emulsion of vinylidene chloride, acrylonitrile, ammonium octadecyl sulphate, ammonium persulphate and sodium metabisulphite, cooling, ageing, and acidifying with citric acid to pH 2.5; (2) by copolymerizing at 38 DEG C. a mixture of vinylidene chloride, methyl methacrylate, a condensation product of formaldehyde with naphthalene sulphonic acid (as dispersing agent), ammonium persulphate, and sodium metabisulphite, cooling and acidifying to pH 3 with hydrochloric acid.",BRITISH CELLOPHANE LTD,BERRY WILLIAM;;OSWIN CHARLES ROBERT;;BOYD JOHN,,https://lens.org/056-602-996-335-310,Granted Patent,no,0,3,6,6,0,C08J2301/06;;C08J2475/02;;C08J7/0427;;C08J7/048;;C08J2301/06;;C08J2475/02;;C08J7/0427;;C08J7/048,C08J7/048,B2E EANA;;B2E E18Y;;B2E E184;;B2E E209;;B2E E21Y;;B2E E214;;B2E E228;;B2E E339;;B2E E361;;B2E E372;;B2E E44Y;;B2E E45X;;B2E E46Y;;B2E E464;;B2E E498;;B2E E532;;B2E E548;;B2E E570;;B2E E65Y;;B2E E708;;B2E E722;;B2E E725;;B2E E726;;B2E E73Y;;B2E E743;;B2E E755;;B2E E756;;B2E E757;;B2E E76Y;;B2E E765;;B2E E766;;B2E E77Y;;B2E E775;;B2E E777;;B2E E785;;B2E E786;;B2E E787;;B2E E79Y,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The acidic constituent may also be a mixture of citraconic and itaconic anhydrides obtained by distillation of citric acid. The preferred mixtures contain more than 80 per cent of vinylidene chloride (e.g. 87 per cent), between 0.5 and 10 per cent of the acidic ingredient and the remainder acrylonitrile. To produce a polymer sufficiently soluble in volatile organic solvents it is generally necessary to use a modifying compound of the formula R.R1C=O, where R and R1 may be hydrogen or a hydrocarbon radical, such as aldehydes and ketones, e.g. methyl isobutyl ketone. 6.5 per cent of modifying compound based on the weight of the polymerizable mixture is preferably used. Polymerization may be effected in bulk, solution or emulsion or by granular processes. A catalyst, e.g. ammonium persulphate, is preferably employed and may be used with an activator, e.g. sodium metabisulphite. Dispersing agents such as sodium long chain alkyl aryl sulphonates are used in emulsion polymerization and modifiers such as long chain mercaptans are preferably employed. An emulsion polymerization is described in which the mixture is maintained at 40 DEG C. with stirring for 20 hours and the product coagulated with aluminium sulphate. The polymers may be dissolved in such solvents as methyl ethyl ketone for application to cellulosic base films in the production of moisture-proof, heat-sealable sheet wrapping material.

Each constant current source comprises a switch S 3  a current sensor R 1 , R 2  and an inductor L 1 , L 2 . Each switch S 3  S 4  is switched on and off at a set frequency which, in the illustrated system, is the same as the pulse repetition frequency of the signal to be amplified. Each time the switch S 3  or S 4  is closed the current in the associated inductor L,, L 2  builds up until a set limit, determined by sensor R 1 , R 2  is reached whereupon the sensor opens the switch S 3 , S 4 . Thus, the period for which switches S 3  and S 4  remain closed varies to maintain the currents to G, and G 2  at the desired levels. By employing this technique the inductors L, and L 2  do not need to be as large as would be required using a known technique described in UK Patent Specification 1566095.

A focusing device for a C.R.T. comprises a supporting member 1, a first annular magnet 4 fixedly held in spaced relation to said member, a second annular magnet 5 disposed coaxially of the first magnet 4 and guided for axial movement relative thereto, and manually rotatable cam means 7 disposed between the magnet 5 and the supporting member 1 and operable to adjust the movable magnet 5 relatively to the fixed magnet 4. The supporting member 1 consists of an aluminium or other non-ferrous apertured plate adapted to encircle the stem of a C.R.T. and provided around its periphery with three parallel rods 2 to which is secured an aluminium or other non-ferrous carrier plate 3 carrying the fixed magnet 4, the movable magnet 5 being mounted on a second carrier plate 6 supported by apertured ears for sliding movement upon the rods 2. The cam means 7 consists of an apertured flanged disc rotatably supported upon a series of lugs bent up from the supporting plate 1, the flange portion of the disc being shaped to form a series of curved ramplike lobes 8 bearing against the ears on the carrier plate 6. The cam disc 7 is rotated by an arm 10, a curved blade spring 11 secured to the arm and bearing at its free end against the rear face of the supporting plate 1 providing a frictional lock. The magnetic repulsion of the two magnets 4 and 5 is assisted by coiled compression springs 9 encircling the rods 2 and bearing at their ends against the carrier plates 3 and 6. Means for centring the focusing device accurately upon a C.R.T. consists of a ring 12 adapted to fit closely upon the stem of the C.R.T. and formed with a slotted extension 13 riding on one of the rods 2 so that it can slide and pivot thereon, a handle 14 extending from the opposite side of the ring for displacing the focusing device. The Provisional Specification states that the cam disc may be rotatably supported on a cylindrical bearing surface fixed to the movable carrier plate or formed integral therewith by a pressing operation and provided with a plurality of arcuate cam elements which extend axially through complementary slots in the supporting plate. The cam elements may consist of appropriately bent metal strips fixed to the cam-plate or bent up therefrom. The cam may take the form of a drum or cup-like member, the rim or peripheral portion being shaped to define the cam elements whilst the body portion is apertured for location upon lugs provided on the inside or outside of the movable carrier plate.

Singleton, T., Singleton, G. W., and Thornley, J. B. Sept. 29. Brakes.-The knocking-off lever 6, Figs. 1 and 2, of a loom is provided with a slot in which fits a pin 4 on a bell-crank 3 pivoted to a bracket 1. The actuation of the lever 6 thus rocks the bell-crank 3, and a pin 7 thereon depresses a pendent rod or tumbler lever 8 pivoted to the brake lever 12, which has a pin 15 for supporting a brake shoe 13 faced with leather &c. and pivoted on the same stud 14 as the lever 12. The brake is thus applied and positively retained against the action of the spring 19, the latter normally holding it out of action against a stop 17. The lever 8 has a handle or projection 10 by which it may be moved from under the pin 7, so that the brake 12 can be taken off and the wheel 18 turned by hand whilst the loom is stopped. The brake shoe 13 may be readily removed on first removing the split pin 20 or a nut from the stud 21. The weighted end 9 of the lever 8 places the latter in position when the lever 6 is moved to start the loom, the lever 8 or the brake lever 12 being slotted and provided with an adjusting-screw &c. to regulate the pressure on the end of the brake lever 12. According to the Provisional Specification, the lever 8 may be hung from the bell-crank, with its free end just above the brake lever.",SINGLETON THOMAS;;SINGLETON GEORGE WILLIAM;;THORNLEY JOHN BERRY,SINGLETON THOMAS;;SINGLETON GEORGE WILLIAM;;THORNLEY JOHN BERRY,,https://lens.org/003-103-314-150-441,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The medium pressure also enables high gas temperatures that provide an effective source of heat in the reactive zone on the wafer that enhances etch rates and provides a practical means of removing ion implanted photoresist.",AXCELIS TECH INC;;UNIV HOUSTON,WOLFE JOHN;;SRIVASTAVA ASEEM;;BERRY IVAN;;SAKTHIVEL PALANI,,https://lens.org/044-662-196-195-814,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,G03F7/427;;H01J37/32192;;H01J37/32752,H01L21/3065,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
