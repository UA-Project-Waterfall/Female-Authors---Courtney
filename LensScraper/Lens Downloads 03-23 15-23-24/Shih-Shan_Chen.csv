By enabling the glass substrate to reciprocate in the chambers, the overall temperature of the glass substrate becomes more uniform. Moreover, the recycled liquid selenium/sulfur and inert gas can be reused, thereby reducing the material cost.",NAT CHUNG SHAN INST SCIENCE & TECH,PAN WEN-CHUEH;;WANG YIH-HSING;;LIN MING-JUNE;;LI JEN-CHIEH;;WEI SHIH-SHAN;;WU TIEN-FU;;CHEN TSAN-TUNG,,https://lens.org/029-285-632-775-934,Patent of Addition,no,0,0,2,2,0,Y02E10/50;;Y02P70/50,C23C14/24;;C23C14/06;;H01L31/0264;;H01L31/0445;;H01L31/18,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

A clamp shoe for gripping a corresponding edge of the annular collar is provided on the bottom end of each clamp plate, and a turnbuckle is fitted with a pair of threaded shafts which engage the upper end portions of the respective clamp plates. By rotating the turnbuckle, the threaded shafts are advanced away from each other against the clamp plates, which pivot on the connecting rod and cause the clamp shoes to tightly engage respective edges of the collar. The clamp is grasped to lift the collar from the chamber and replace the collar in the chamber after cleaning or maintenance.
