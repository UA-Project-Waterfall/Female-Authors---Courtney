   A content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system has a front-end that includes a pipeline of one or more dynamically-constructed filters for measuring perceptual similarities between a query image and one or more candidate images retrieved from a back-end comprised of a knowledge base accessed by an inference engine. The images include at least one color set having a set of properties including a number of pixels each having at least one color, a culture color associated with the color set, a mean and variance of the color set, a moment invariant, and a centroid. The filters analyze and compare the set of properties of the query image to the set of properties of the candidate images. Various filters are used, including: a Color Mask filter that identifies identical culture colors in the images, a Color Histogram filter that identifies a distribution of colors in the images, a Color Average filter that performs a similarity comparison on the average of the color sets of the images, a Color Variance filter that performs a similarity comparison on the variances of the color sets of the images, a Spread filter that identifies a spatial concentration of a color in the images, an Elongation filter that identifies a shape of a color in the images, and a Spatial Relationship filter that identifies a spatial relationship between the color sets in the images.

It is a self-cleaning design with automatic resetting function. The valve consists of an outer body with an inlet and outlet port with an internally installed rubber Venturi tube assembly, fixed flange, moving flange, coil spring and surge flow suppressing orifice. The lower pressure causes the rubber tube to be squeezed by the water pressure, and then automatically shuts off the valve. When the supply water pressure drops below 5 psi the Overflow Shutoff Valve automatically resets and opens to normal position. A flow suppressor orifice prevents any surge flow or start up flow which could cause premature shutoff of the valve.

   A portable urinal apparatus includes a supporter attached to the top of a catch basin and a discharge tube attached to the bottom of the catch basin, in which the catch basin is constructed so as to catch urinary fluids and direct those fluids down through the discharge tube into the toilet bowl of a conventional sit down toilet. An interior chamber is defined by the walls of the catch basin. The sides of the catch basin are sloped to direct fluids towards the middle and bottom of the interior chamber of the catch basin, rather than outside the basin. The bottom of the catch basin is sloped to direct fluids towards the discharge tube. When in use, the bottom end of the discharge tube is positioned over the middle area of the toilet bowl.

Some of the benefits are that it increases the life, upgradability, mobility, re usability, and the capacity of a PC so that it results in reducing the overall PC cost, providi ng novice PC users with friendliness, and providing power users with necessary computing power at a low cost. The invention also helps the environment by limiting the impact components in li eu of the entire PC. Industrial companies benefit most from this invention because of the volume of PCs. The benefit will be even greater when the companies utilize the high-end application ""Virtual Mainframe"" configuration by combining the modular sections accordingly.",CHOI EDWARD JE CHANG,CHOI EDWARD JE-CHANG,,https://lens.org/137-355-509-223-09X,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,G06F1/16;;G06F1/181;;G06F1/184;;G06F1/183,G06F1/16,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

C. or greater, is disclosed. The method comprises the steps of: (a) forming a porous preform from particles of a first aluminum alloy via cold-pressing, the preform having the shape and dimension of the aluminum alloy article to be fabricated; (b) squeeze-casting a molten second aluminum alloy into void spaces of the porous preform to form an aluminum composite containing the first aluminum alloy, which serves as a reinforcement phase, dispersed in the second aluminum alloy, which serves as a matrix phase; (c) wherein the molten second aluminum alloy is cast at such temperatures so as to cause a surface of the first aluminum alloy particles to melt and thereby form a strong bonding with the second aluminum alloy. The first aluminum alloy particles are formed by melt-spinning, followed by rapid solidification and precipitation, of a composition of the first aluminum alloy to form a thin ribbon, then pulverizing the thin ribbon into particles. Unlike the prior art processes, which fabricate high-temperature aluminum alloys only in essentially two-dimensional articles, the method disclosed herein allows the capability of near net shaping, i.e., it can fabricate high-temperature aluminum alloy articles of essentially any intended shapes.

   An automatic tester uses a coarse timing subsystem and a formatter circuit to generate a first formatted waveform with coarse timing based on the information stored in a vector memory subsystem. The first formatted waveform is refined by a timing refiner circuit to form a second formatted waveform with precise timing. The timing refiner circuit includes a flip-flop device to re-synchronize and remove jitter in the first formatted waveform. A counter and/or shift register and vernier circuit in the timing refiner circuit then triggers the leading and trailing edges of the second formatted waveform with precise timing. The formatter circuit may be eliminated by using control signals of the memory devices in the vector memory subsystem to manipulate timing. The coarse timing subsystem may further be eliminated by providing sufficient range for the counters in the timing refiner circuit.

The present invention teaches a novel submicron (<0.2 mm) T-gate technology using shift mask technique. The 8% half-tone PSM was selected for the definition of the isolated narrow space. Before lithography, 2500 Å Si3N4 film was deposited on the wafer. After I-line PSM exposure and RIE etching of the silicon nitride film, openings with less than 0.25 mum wide were formed on the Si3N4 film. To further reduce the dimension of the openings, the wafer was then deposited addition 500 Å nitride and etched back using RIE without any mask. Less than 0.2 mum openings were formed on the wafer after the dry etch. The wafer was then coated with another layer of photoresist to form lift-off structure.

   The present invention is directed a nonwoven fabric which is imparted with a durable three-dimensional image or pattern during the fabrication stage. The three-dimensional image or pattern imparted into the structure of the nonwoven fabric results in a lofty material with capturing recesses or pockets which act to entrap and retain body surface contaminants. The three-dimensional image or pattern also results in a number of fibrous ends and loops which extend beyond the surface of the recesses or pockets, which in turn, improve the nonwoven fabrics ability to effectively collect low viscosity contaminants from the surface of the skin to be cleaned.

The feeds thus can be separately positioned about the lens surface along mutually orthogonal paths in response to control signals over a wide range. This facilitates continuous communication as the direction of a satellite from the site changes by utilizing two satellites simultaneously so that when one goes out of sight, the other can be used to continue communications.",DATRON TRANSCO INC,LEE CHANG SOB;;RAYNER MARK EDWARD,L-3 COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (2011-01-19);;DATRON ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES INC (2001-04-13),https://lens.org/026-577-912-222-571,Granted Patent,yes,7,27,3,3,0,G06N3/126;;G06N3/126;;H01Q3/08;;H01Q3/08;;H01Q15/08;;H01Q15/08;;H01Q19/062;;H01Q19/062;;H01Q25/007;;H01Q25/007,G06N3/12;;H01Q3/08;;H01Q15/08;;H01Q19/06;;H01Q25/00,343911L;;343/754;;343/757;;343/766,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   A system and method for generating real-time promotions to a visitor of an electronic commerce (e-commerce) World Wide website to increase the likelihood of purchase on the website by the visitor. The system and method receive and store clickstream data provided by the visitor, and calculate the probability that the visitor will leave the website or will make a purchase on the website based upon this clickstream data. The system and method then utilize the calculated probabilities, as well as the frequency of visits to the website by the visitor, and the time of the visit to the website, to decide whether or not real-time promotions should be generated on the website. If it is decided that promotions should be generated, then the system and method automatically calculate what promotions to send, when to send them, and how to send them. The system and method enable e-commerce owners and managers to better direct their promotions, enable promotions to be tailored to the visitors' display preferences, and generate the right promotion at the right time and the right place. Furthermore, the system and method become increasingly effective and refined with more visitors to the e-commerce website, providing the e-commerce website owner or manager with a better understanding of his or her customers, increased revenue, and greater marketing efficiency. The visitors to the e-commerce website, in turn, receive better service, information and value.

The solid substance is less finely divided prior to dissolution than when deposited on the substrate and the deposition density of the solid substance on the substrate is regulated at least in part by solid substance concentration. The solid substance is insoluble in a liquified gas and the first solution is soluble in the liquified gas. The solvent also is capable of depressing the freezing point of the liquified gas upon expansion of the liquified gas. The first solution is dissolved in the liquified gas to create a second solution having a sufficient concentration of the solvent relative to the liquified gas that solidification of the liquified gas is substantially prevented upon the expansion thereof. Preferably, this concentration of solvent is a minimum to prevent overuse of environmentally hazardous solvents. The solution is sprayed against the substrate so that a portion of the liquified gas flashes into a vapor and the second solution containing a remaining portion of the liquified gas contacts and thereby coats the surface substrate. The remaining portion of the liquified gas is evaporated along with the solvent, so that the solid substance remains as a deposit on the substrate.

SOLUTION: On a client side, a navigation(NV) tree is structured as a classification tree on the basis of a classifier (LCC, etc.), to index a large number of documents. At this time, a system 900 before introducing a document into the NV tree puts a query for the classifier by using the information in the document. The classifier returns a classification tree 901 in response. From this classification tree 901, the NV tree is structured adaptively to the size of a user's collection. For example, users A and B structure data sets 904 and 905 as to an access pattern and preference and individualized NV trees 906 and 907 corresponding to data sets 902 and 903 as to a document collection.",NEC CORP,WEN SHAN LEE;;KUOKKU UU;;CHANG EDWARD,,https://lens.org/116-180-950-629-628,Patent Application,no,0,7,3,3,0,G06F16/954;;G06F16/954;;Y10S707/99942;;Y10S707/99944;;Y10S707/99943;;Y10S707/99945,G06F12/00;;G06F17/30,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The present invention works to reduce the erratic effects that multipath channel interference and random noise play in target location systems due to incorrect identification of the main pulse of the transmit signal. In addition to providing for a greater accuracy and consistency in a TOA-based target location system, the method also provides for an opportunity to reduce a transmission bandwidth associate with the TOA transmission by the multiple receivers. The method may be considered a post-processing element, as the determination of TOA and DTOA may require a real-time calculation, where the timing constraints for the ensuing target location estimate may be less severe.",ZEBRA TECH CORP,RICHLEY EDWARD A;;TURNER BELINDA;;WANG CHANG,ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION (2018-12-20);;ZIH CORP (2017-09-25),https://lens.org/173-719-258-025-629,Granted Patent,yes,204,3,10,10,0,G01S5/02213;;G01S5/0244;;G01S5/0218;;G01S5/0244;;G01S5/0218;;G01S5/02213;;G01S5/0218;;G01S5/0244;;G01S5/02213;;G01S5/06,H04W24/00;;G01S5/02;;G01S5/06,,40,12,095-335-852-715-462;;036-382-388-904-551;;046-075-867-639-620;;063-882-363-385-716;;127-729-375-101-783;;078-910-947-983-138;;172-736-594-973-087;;095-335-852-715-462;;036-382-388-904-551;;055-864-160-468-897;;096-637-854-987-621;;148-563-817-838-067,10.1109/hpcc.and.euc.2013.297;;10.1109/surv.2009.090308;;10.1109/uwbst.2003.1267866;;10.1109/2.989928;;10.1109/tnsre.2004.827825;;15218943;;10.1109/jproc.2008.2008786;;10.1109/icu.2005.1570035;;10.1109/hpcc.and.euc.2013.297;;10.1109/surv.2009.090308;;10.1109/percomw.2013.6529528;;10.1145/1864349.1864367;;10.1109/ecticon.2008.4600544,"Yongcai Wang, “An Algorithmic and Systematic Approach for Improving Robustness of TOA-based Localization”; 2013 IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications & 2013 IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing.;;Ismail Guvenc, “A Survey on TOA Based Wireless Localization & NLOS Mitigation Techniques”; IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, vol. 11, No. 3, Third Quarter 2009.;;Swedberg, Claire, “USDA Researchers Develop System to Track Livestock Feeding Behavior Unobtrusively”, RFID Journal, Jul. 18, 2013.;;International Search Report and Written Opinion from International Application No. PCT/US2014/041062 dated Oct. 1, 2014.;;International Search Report and Written Opinion from International Application No. PCT/US2014/040947 dated Oct. 9, 2014.;;Fontana, R.J., Richley, E., Barney, J., “Commercialization of an Ultra Wideband Precision Asset Location System,” 2003 IEEE Conference on Ultra Wideband Systems and Technologies, Nov. 16-19, 2003.;;Gueziec, A., “Tracking Pitches for Broadcast Television,” Computer, Aug. 7, 2002.;;CattleLog Pro, eMerge Interactive, Inc., Sebastian, FL, 2004.;;Marchant, J., Secure Animal Identification and Source Verification, JM Communications, UK, 2002.;;“A Guide to Using NLIS Approved Ear Tags and Rumen Boluses,” National Livestock Identification Scheme, Meat & Livestock Australia Limited, North Sydney, Australia, May 2003.;;King, L., “NAIS Cattle ID Pilot Projects Not Needed, Since Proven Advanced Technology Already Exists,” ScoringSystem, Inc., Sarasota, FL, Dec. 27, 2005.

The present invention works to reduce the erratic effects that multipath channel interference and random noise play in target location systems due to incorrect identification of the main pulse of the transmit signal. In addition to providing for a greater accuracy and consistency in a TOA-based target location system, the method also provides for an opportunity to reduce a transmission bandwidth associate with the TOA transmission by the multiple receivers.

    A digital imaging system is provided for interpolating a full color image from a camera having an array of single color sensors. Measured color values are stored as an array of data elements in a memory of the system. Each data element corresponds to the measured color value from one sensor. A set of gradient values is determined for each data element at a specific location in the array. The gradient values correspond to color value differences in a plurality of directions from the data element. From the set of gradient values, a threshold value is determined. Using the threshold value, a subset of gradient values is selected so that the members of the subset have gradient values less than the threshold. Additional color values for each data element are interpolated according to the subset of gradient values.

This invention also provides a method, based on the principles of strained interfaces blocking the threading dislocation generated from the Ge epitaxial layers, to reduce the total thickness, dislocation density and surface roughness on the Ge epitaxial layers. Firstly, precleaning the Si substrate in a standard cleaning procedure, dipping it with HF solution and prebaking to remove its native oxidized layer. Then, growing a high Ge-contained epitaxial layer, such as Si0.1Ge0.9 in a thickness of 0.8 μm on said Si substrate using ultra-high vacuum chemical vapor deposition under certain conditions. During the period of growing, many dislocations are generated and located near the interface and in the low part of Si0.1Ge0.9 due to the large mismatch between this layer and Si substrate. Furthermore, a subsequent 0.8 μm Si0.5Ge0.95 layers, and optionally a further 0.8 μm Si0.02Ge0.98 layer, are grown. The formed strained interfaces of said layers can bend and terminate the propagated upward dislocation very effectively. Then, a film of Ge is grown on said uppermost epitaxial layer.

This invention also provides a method, based on the principles of strained interfaces blocking the threading dislocation generated from the first epitaxial layer, to reduce the total thickness, dislocation density and surface roughness on the Ge epitaxial layers. Firstly, precleaning the Si substrate in a standard cleaning procedure, dipping it with 10% HF solution and prebaking to remove its native oxidized layer. Subsequently, growing a high Ge-containing epitaxial layer, such as Si0.1Ge0.9 in a thickness of 0.8 μm on said Si substrate using ultra-high vacuum chemical vapor deposition under certain conditions. During the period of growing, many dislocations generated and located near the interface and in the low part of Si0.1Ge0.9 due to the large mismatch between this layer and Si substrate. Furthermore, a subsequent 0.8 μm Si0.05Ge0.95 layers, and optionally a further 0.8 μm Si0.02Ge0.98 layer, are grown. The formed strained interfaces of said layers can bend and terminate the propagated upward dislocation very effectively. Finally a Ge film is grown on said layer.",UNIV NAT CHIAO TUNG,LIOU GUANG-LI;;YANG TSUNG-HSI;;CHANG CHUN-YEN;;CHANG EDWARD Y,,https://lens.org/043-541-900-734-352,Patent of Addition,no,0,1,2,7,0,,H01L21/324,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In particular, methods, devices, and systems are provided for decoding words and sentences directly from neural activity of an individual. Cortical activity from a region of the brain involved in speech processing is recorded while an individual attempts to say or spell out words. Deep learning computational models are used to detect and classify words from the recorded brain activity. Decoding of speech from brain activity is aided by use of a language model that predicts how likely certain sequences of words are to occur. In addition, decoding of attempted non-speech motor movements from neural activity can be used to further assist communication. This neurotechnology can be used to restore communication to patients who have lost the ability to speak and has the potential to improve autonomy and quality of life.",UNIV CALIFORNIA;;MOSES DAVID;;LIU JESSIE;;METZGER SEAN,MOSES DAVID;;LIU JESSIE;;METZGER SEAN;;CHANG EDWARD,,https://lens.org/074-297-947-152-344,Search Report,yes,0,0,5,5,0,G10L15/24;;A61B5/372;;A61B5/37;;A61B5/7264;;A61B5/741;;A61B5/7278,A61B5/372;;G10L15/24,,0,0,,,,PENDING

    Method and system for analyzing local composition and structure of a compound having one or more non-zero gradients in concentration for one or more selected constituents in a selected direction. A beam of X rays having representative energy E is received by a mono-capillary or poly-capillary device and is directed at a selected small region of the compound. A portion of the X rays is diffracted at the selected region by one or more constituents of the compound, at each of two or more diffraction angles relative to a selected surface or lattice plane(s) of the compound; and the diffracted portion of X rays for each of these diffraction angles is received and analyzed at an X-ray detector. A portion of the X rays excites fluorescence radiation that is received by a fluorescence detector to estimate the relative concentrations in a compound having two or more constituents. Fluorescence X rays and diffraction X rays can be detected at each desired translational position and rotation for a target site. As a result, a concentration map for various constituents in the compound can be prepared, together with a phase map illustrating the structure of a combinatorial compound. An X-ray detector monochromator can be removed and a capillary diameter can be reduced in some situations.

   An embodiment of the invention provides an improved circuit and method for capturing and observing internal signals on an integrated circuit. Internal signals are routed to a multiplexer that either selects normal-operation signals or debug signals. A counter creates addresses where the debug signals are be stored in an on-chip RAM. A second multiplexer selects either normal-operation addresses or addresses created by the counter. The output of the second multiplexer provides addresses for the on-chip RAM. After debug signals are stored in the on-chip RAM, they may, at a later time, be read from the RAM to a BIST engine.

   A gas distribution grid for a slurry reactor includes a plurality of gas injectors horizontally arrayed across, and extending through, an otherwise gas and liquid impervious plate. The injectors have a throat open at both ends, with a gas pressure reducing bore at one end which is the entrance end and with the other end opening into an upward opening cone. Flow diverting means in the injectors prevents slurry solids from entering the throat and being attrited by the high velocity gas jet exiting the bore into the throat. It is preferred that the gas injectors not protrude above the top surface of the grid and flat space is eliminated by means such as angular fillers, to prevent solids accumulation top of the grid. A chamfer may be present at the junction of the bore and throat to prevent unrestricted expansion of the gas jet entering the throat. This is useful for injecting gas into a reactive hydrocarbon synthesis slurry in a slurry reactor, with reduced catalyst attrition and deactivation.

   A gas distribution grid for a slurry reactor includes a plurality of gas injectors horizontally arrayed across, and extending through, an otherwise gas and liquid impervious plate. The injectors have a throat open at both ends, with a gas pressure reducing bore at one end which is the entrance end and with the other end opening into an upward opening cone. Flow diverting means in the injectors prevents slurry solids from entering the throat and being attrited by the high velocity gas jet exiting the bore into the throat. It is preferred that the gas injectors not protrude above the top surface of the grid and flat space is eliminated by means such as angular fillers, to prevent solids accumulation top of the grid. A chamfer may be present at the junction of the bore and throat to prevent unrestricted expansion of the gas jet entering the throat. This is useful for injecting gas into a reactive hydrocarbon synthesis slurry in a slurry reactor, with reduced catalyst attrition and deactivation.

When used in combination, the p-toluenesulfonic acid and the bifunctional dopant together have a much greater effect on the contrast ratio, which is increased to within a range of 11-19 depending on dopant concentrations. The contrast ratio improvement varies within this range for many different proportions, with the p-toluenesulfonic acid being present in concentrations of up to several hundred parts per million (ppm) and the bifunctional material being present in concentrations of up to several weight per cent. The contrast ratio range is adequate for display purposes, however, the cutoff electrical excitation frequency (above which all dynamic scattering ceases) for the doped liquid crystal varies over a range of from about 180 Hertz to 400 Hertz. The addition of the selected dopants to the nematic liquid crystal stabilizes the mixture in the presence of sunlight, oxygen and water, and against electric field deterioration thus reducing the dependence of the final display characteristics on meticulous care in preparing and handling the liquid crystal mixture and on the environment (sunlight and electric field) to which the finished display device is exposed. The preferred liquid crystal mixture is .51 weight % p-aminophenol with 191 ppm p-toluenesulfonic acid in a nematic material such as substantially 55% 4-methoxybenzylidene-4'-n-butyl-aniline and substantially 45% 4-ethoxybenzylidene-4'-n-butylaniline by weight.",ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL CORP,JONES JR FREEMAN B;;CHANG ROGER;;PARRY EDWARD P,,https://lens.org/184-518-539-134-555,Granted Patent,no,10,8,1,1,0,C09K19/58;;C09K19/58,C09K19/58,252/299,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   The distributed broadband cable modem termination system centralizes the point to multi-point function of the downstream signaling while simultaneously localizing the multi-point to single point functions of the upstream signaling. The upstream broadband cable termination segment of the broadband cable modem termination system is located at a different layer of the broadband cable network from the downstream broadband cable modem termination segment of the broadband cable modem termination system. By splitting the broadband cable modem termination system functions into separable and independently operable upstream and downstream functions, network deployment is optimized for a number of reasons. The downstream and upstream functions scale independently so the system can selectively add capacity where needed in the direction needed independent of the capacity in the reverse direction. In addition, this architecture provides additional flexibility by supporting a number of concurrently operational implementations. Within a single broadband cable network, the upstream and downstream segments of the broadband cable modem termination system can be located at different layers of the broadband cable network as long as the interconnected upstream and downstream segments of the broadband cable modem termination system for a particular communication path are at different levels of the broadband cable network.

Ripples in image data are reduced by eliminating the effects of single pixel defects before filtering for crosstalk caused by electrical crosstalk between sensor elements in an imager. Dark current is removed from image data generated by an imager by subtracting a fraction of a determined dark current value from all image data generated by the imager to compensate for nonlinearities in dark current across the imager.

The injectors have a throat open at both ends, with a gas pressure reducing bore at one end which is the entrance end and with the other end opening into an upward opening cone. Flow diverting means in the injectors prevents slurry solids from entering the throat and being attrited by the high velocity gas jet exiting the bore into the throat. It is preferred that the gas injectors not protrude above the top surface of the grid and flat space is eliminated by means such as angular fillers, to prevent solids accumulation top of the grid. A chamfer may be present at the junction of the bore and throat to prevent unrestricted expansion of the gas jet entering the throat. This is useful for injecting gas into a reactive hydrocarbon synthesis slurry in a slurry reactor, with reduced catalyst attrition and deactivation.

A fiber entry whip reducer positioned in front of the fiber winding device includes at least one pulley and a guide channel including a straight entry section and a curved section leading to the fiber winding device. The guide channel is formed and positioned such that the loose end of the fiber is maintained against the guide channel by centrifugal force imparted onto the fiber by the curvature of the channel and forward motion of the fiber produced by the rotating spool, thereby producing a trajectory such that the loose end of the fiber enters the fiber winding device and is maintained against the whip shield.
