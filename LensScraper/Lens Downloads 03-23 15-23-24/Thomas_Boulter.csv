A pressure actuated locking arm assembly allows for the rotation of the rotor to the first stage arming position, while the removal of a wind tab allows for the rotation of the rotor to the second stage or fully armed position. In this position under impact in any direction a spherical weight located adjacent to the firing pin assembly causes movement thereof against the detonator and subsequent detonation of the fuze. It is this pressure actuation in conjunction with two-stage arming and omni-directional impact detonation which makes this fuze extremely safe and reliable in operation.",US AIR FORCE,WESSON JERRY J;;BOULTER THOMAS W,,https://lens.org/151-664-186-794-563,Granted Patent,no,5,6,1,1,0,F42C1/06;;F42C1/06,F42C1/06,102 76   R;;102 73   A;;102/81,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

INTERNATIONAL COMPUTERS Ltd. 27 Dec., 1967 [6 Jan., 1967], No. 908/67. Heading B8R. Documents 1 of various size are fed from the bottom of a stack by a suction drum 4, a document being fed when suction is applied, and thereafter being forwarded by a roller 7 to a conveyer 10, 11. Double feed is prevented by an adjustable plate 3 and reverse rollers 14 engaging grooves in the drum. The vertical position of the rollers 14 controls the slip between the document and the drum and thus the time when the leading edge of the documents passes a photo-cell 13. A signal representing the time and a series of pulses representing the desired timing are passed to a counter which derives the delay or prematurity of each document, whereby lamps indicate by their intensity a weighted average of the number of documents in various time increments. The rollers are adjusted manually or automatically until it is indicated that most documents are in the desired time range.",INT COMPUTERS LTD,BAULDREAY JOHN;;BOULTER DAVID GORDON;;CHILES FREDERICK THOMAS,,https://lens.org/160-543-955-750-617,Granted Patent,no,0,0,8,8,0,G06K13/067;;G06K13/067,G06K13/067,B8R RAA5          RAA5;;B8R R10A3         -;;B8R R10B7         RAA5;;B8R R10C1C        RAA5;;B8R R10C7         RAA5;;B8R R10E1         RAA5;;B8R R10E4         RAA5;;B8R R10R11        RAA5;;B8R R10R6         RAA5,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The stream flows are adjusted so that one deposits on the bed over at least 50% of kiln length from the discharge end and the second deposits primarily on the bed over regions requiring the greatest heat-transfer rates. The streams are produced by blowing the particles with low pressure air.",DAVY MCEY STOCKTON LTD,BEKER ALLEN C;;BOULTER JEFFERY N;;GOODEL THOMAS W;;KENNELLY JAMES A,,https://lens.org/161-161-201-999-312,Granted Patent,no,0,1,12,12,0,C21B13/08;;C21B13/08;;C21B13/08;;Y02P10/20;;Y02P10/20,C22B5/10;;C21B13/08,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
