Oct. 4, 1954 [Oct. 26, 1953], No. 29532/55. Class 37. [Also in Group XI] An electric torch or flash lamp, of the type having a metal casing 10 which houses a battery 11 and is included in the circuit between the battery and the bulb 13 when the latter is illuminated, is adapted for the testing of cartridge fuses or the continuity of a circuit by providing on the casing an auxiliary external contact 19 which is completely and permanently exposed and insulated from the casing, so that when one end of a conductor is placed on the contact 19 and the other end on the casing 10, the lamp will be illuminated. In the example the auxiliary contact 19 is substantially in the form of a bifurcated rivet with its head insulated from the casing by a disc 20 provided with a tubular shank through which the two retaining limbs of the rivet are inserted, one limb 21 being shown extended upwardly to bear upon a conical reflector 15 which is held in position by a lens 16 secured in the upper end of the casing. A convention switch 16a can be operated to bring aal contact strip 17 against the reflector 15 for normal operation of the torch. In a modification, Fig. 4 (not shown), the auxiliary contact comprises a small slidable plunger which is normally pressed radially outward of the casing by a surrounding helical spring, the part of the plunger within the casing being provided with a lateral contact stem which is normally held apart from the adjacent end of a contact strip mounted on the end of the reflector. In testing a cartridge fuse one end is held against the torch casing and the other end pressed down upon the plunger.",D S PLUGS LTD,CHANDLER JOHN;;CHANDLER JOHN WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/171-278-415-280-639,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,G01R31/54;;G01R31/54;;G01R31/52;;G01R31/52;;H01H2085/0216,G01R31/02,F4R R244          AB;;F4R R254          AB;;F4R R27Y          AB;;F4R R275          AB;;F4R R29X          AB;;F4R R41Y          AB;;F4R R414          AB;;F4R R44Y          AB;;F4R R444          AB;;F4R R466          AB;;F4R R510          AB;;F4R R615          AB;;F4R R62Y          AB;;F4R R621          AB;;F4R R631          AB;;F4R R714          AB;;G1U UC2A          UC2A,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Protective cut-out arrangements. COAL INDUSTRY (PATENTS), Ltd. Aug. 18, 1954 [May 18, 1953], No. 13921/53. Class 38 (5). In a remote control and protective system suitable for mines wherein a motor 14 (or other device) is connected to the supply 10 over contacts of a contactor X and cable 15, under the control of a two-position switch 13 at the motor, a number of interlocking relays A ... D are provided having contacts which operate to ensure the correct sequence of relay operation in closing the contactor and to ensure opening of the contactor in the event of failure of the supply, open- or short-circuited pilot circuit 16, 17, and in some cases earthing of a power lead to the pilot circuit. The contacts are shown in the positions they occupy when the supply is dead. Relay A has windings a, b polarized by rectifiers so that their effects are additive, relays C, D have copper slugs which cause them to release with a time-delay, and a resistance R1 is adjusted so that relay B will just pick up with a supply voltage of 69 per cent normal. With the switch 13 "" off "" and rectifiers S4, S9 operative, winding a energizes relay C to close C1 and change C2. If 13 is now moved to "" run,"" B is energized and a de-energized but before it releases, B is energized and makes a maintaining circuit at B1 and also energizes relay D over contacts B2. Relay D makes its holding circuit at D2 (independent of C2) and closes the contactor circuit at D1. When 13 is moved back to "" off "" position, relay B releases contact B2 and A changes over AI, but the delay of D prevents shorting of the pilot circuit at B2, C2, D2. If the pilot breaks or the supply volts fall unduly, B releases and D opens the contactor X, or if the switch 13 is "" off,"" relay A releases, so that in both cases all relays are de-energized. On restoration of the supply or pilot, switch 13 must be in (or be moved to) the "" off "" position in order to reclose the contactor as described. With a short-circuit in the pilot, both relays A, B pick up, C, D are (or remain) de-energized and the pilot is locked shorted by contacts B2, C2, D2, current being limited by a resistance R2 to a low value. In order to resume working after repair of the fault, all armatures must be released and starting effected as before described. If a sufficient leakage to the pilot occurs when the motor is running, winding b causes relay A to pick up, the operation then being as with a shorted pilot. Fig. 2 (not shown) illustrates an arrangement employing only one slow-release relay in addition to the starting and running relays, and the contactor circuit has contacts in series and controlled by all the relays. Fig. 3 (not shown) illustrates a further arrangement in which relays A, B have slugs and additional delay-action relays C, D are provided. In Fig. 4 (not shown) relays A, B, C are again timedelayed and have series-connected contacts in the contactor circuit, but a holding contact closed by the contactor shorts the closing-relay contact which opens with a delay.",COAL INDUSTRY PATENTS LTD,CHANDLER KENNETH WILLIAM;;ROSTON BENJAMIN,,https://lens.org/155-956-520-801-66X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H02H7/005,H02H7/00,H2K KHE           HE,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Frequency discriminators; pulse frequency detectors. COAL INDUSTRY (PATENTS) Ltd. June 19, 1963 [March 19, 1962], No. 10424/62. Headings H3A and H3T. A frequency discriminator comprises an amplifier and pulse shaper, J15-J18, Fig. 4 (not shown), for converting an input sine wave S, Fig. 1 (not shown), into a square wave which triggers a scaling circuit J19, J20 producing complementary square wave outputs A and B of half the input frequency; the B output is differentiated and triggers a timing circuit J21, J22 producing pulses of constant length T, and the inverted output of the timing circuit together with the A output are fed to an AND gate J24 which is opened only when both inputs are zero, thereby producing output pulses H of constant amplitude of a duration equal to the difference between T and half a cycle of A, these pulses being fed to an output meter M which indicates the frequency. T may be varied to vary the frequency at which the meter shows zero. The input S may be derived from an acoustic gas detection system, and the meter M may then indicate the concentration of methane in a gas mixture. Pulse frequency detectors.-The A and B pulses derived as above feed a control circuit, Fig. 5 (not shown), adapted to operate a relay when the input frequency is either above or below a predetermined value. The A pulses trigger a long timing circuit J27, J28 which holds gate J33, J34 open and gate J29 closed for the duration of the long timing pulses. The B pulses trigger a short timing circuit J25, J26, and pulses are produced across R77 and R89 by differentiating circuits at each end of the short timing pulses. Thus if the frequency is high, Fig. 2a (not shown), the pulses across R89 pass through gate J33, J34 to set a bi-stable circuit J31, J32, to one state. If the frequency is low, Fig. 2c, pulses across R77 pass through gate J29 to set the bi-stable circuit to its other state.

Addressing data stores; computers. BURROUGHS CORP. 20 Sept., 1968 [25 Sept., 1967], No. 44740/68. Headings G4A and G4C. Address manipulation circuitry for a digital computer comprises a computer memory, a peripheral memory, and a source of copy descriptors and mother descriptors referencing information stored in groups of memory cells forming arrays in the computer memory, each mother descriptor including fields designating respectively: (1) the base address of an array in the computer memory or the array address in the peripheral memory, (2) length of array, (3) nature of field (1), each copy descriptor including fields designating respectively: (1) the base address of an array or the location of the mother descriptor of the array in the source, (2) the index value of a cell in the array relative to the base address, (3) nature of field (1), there being means responsive to an instruction to access a cell of the computer memory to address this memory with the sum of fields (1) and (2) of an appropriate copy descriptor if field (3) of this descriptor designates field (1) as containing a base address. General.-The computer memory includes a last-in-first-out stack to hold the descriptors (see above) but the locations of the stack are also addressable randomly by a memory address register also used for addressing the rest of the computer memory. The peripheral (back-up) memory may be a disc file or magnetic tape. Besides the fields mentioned above, each descriptor includes a field (4) specifying the descriptor as mother or copy. During operation, fields (3) and (4) are consulted and updated as appropriate. In the course of generation of the descriptors, a mother descriptor is generated for information in an array the first time it is referenced and a copy descriptor on each subsequent reference, so all the copy descriptors related to a given mother descriptor lie above it in the stack. Accessing a cell of computer memory.-A computer-memory-access instruction causes the top descriptor in the stack to be obtained. If it is a copy descriptor with a base address in field (1), fields (1) and (2) are added and used to address the computer memory. If it is a copy descriptor with a mother descriptor address in field (1), this address is used to access this mother descriptor from the stack. If the mother descriptor has a peripheral address in field (1), the computer programme is interrupted and fields (1) and (2) of the mother descriptor are used to obtain the array from peripheral memory, this array being stored in an unused portion of computer memory and its new base address being substituted for the peripheral address in field (1) of the mother descriptor. Thus if the mother descriptor did not initially have a base address in field (1) it has now, and in either case the base address is transferred to field (1) of the copy descriptor and added to field (2) of the copy descriptor to address the computer memory. If, alternatively, the original descriptor is a mother descriptor it is treated like the mother descriptor referred to above up to the point where it contains a base address in field (1), when an index value is inserted in field (2) and the sum of these fields is used to address the computer memory. As a modification, field (2) of either type of descriptor could contain an index value or an array length, a further field of the descriptor indicating which and causing replacement of a length by an index value from the stack before addition. Updating descriptors (see above also).-When an array has to be returned from peripheral to computer memory as described above, but there is no room, an array has to be transferred to the peripheral memory to make room. The computer memory is addressed to obtain (from the stack) the mother descriptor relating to the array to be sent to peripheral memory and field (1) of each descriptor above this mother descriptor in the stack is compared with field (1) of the mother descriptor, being replaced with the address in memory of the mother descriptor if equal. Finally, the peripheral address of the array is inserted into field (1) of the mother descriptor. All the descriptors are returned to their locations in the stack after use.

COAL INDUSTRY (PATENTS) Ltd. 15 Dec., 1967 [19 Dec., 1966], No. 56676/66. Heading B8B. A control system in a colliery shaft winding apparatus for preventing an accumulation of slack cable above a halted cage comprises a unit 1 for producing a first output signal 2 related to the amount of cable displaced by a winding drum, a detection device 6 for producing a second output signal 7 related to the extent of movement of a cage attached to the cable, and a means responsive to the first and second outputs which produces a control output when displacement of the cable exceeds the extent of movement of the cage by a predetermined maximum excess of movement, which control output prevents further displacement of the cable. The unit 1 comprises a pair of solid state detectors associated with a plate rotatable in proportion to the cable drum, and capable of generating the pulsating output 2 representing movement of the cable and passing directly to a pulse counter 4, and a pulsating output 3 which indicates the direction of rotation of the cable drum and which passes to a counter control circuit 5. The cage detection device 6 which is provided in the delivery/loading station area of the shaft, comprises a reed switch commutator unit driven by a spring-loaded wheel engageable by a skid on the cage in the detection area, a pulsating output 7 from the detector 6 passing to the counter control circuit 5. In operation, upon rotation of the drum, pulses of the output 2 feed the counter 4 until a predetermined number, indicative of a predetermined cable length, cause the counter to trip, which produces a signal to stop further rotation of the drum. The counter trip can only be cleared if the drum is rotated in the opposite direction to wind up the cable. The pulses of signal 2 are added or subtracted at the counter 4 depending on whether the pulses of signal 3 represent the paying out or winding in direction of the drum respectively. The pulses of output 7 from the cage detector 6 cause the count in the counter 4 to be reduced to zero or by unity per pulse such that pulses from the unit 1 are balanced out provided the cage is moving whilst in the detection zone. Once the cage leaves this zone a cut-off device prevents the counter from tripping. An indication of slip either between the cable and the drum or between the cage and the detector unit is achieved by comparing the occurrences of the output pulses 2 and the output pulses 7.",COAL INDUSTRY PATENTS LTD,SMITH ROYEL ALBERT;;CHANDLER KENNETH WILLIAM;;WOOD PHILIP,,https://lens.org/013-519-429-843-813,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,B66B5/125,B66B5/12,B8B BCCA          BCCA;;B8B B50           -;;B8B B59           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

April 2, 1959 [April 3, 1958], No. 10918/58. Class 141 In a pleating machine for producing converging pleats, wherein an upper set of pleating arms 9 is pivoted at one end 23 so that the other ends of the arms may interengage with the arms of a lower set, the arms of both sets are pivoted individually at 8 for horizontal angular movement so that the interengaging ends of the arms can be made to converge. The two sets of pleating arms are mounted on upper and lower sections 5, 4 of a slidable carriage. Associated with each. set of arms is a guide plate 15, 12 having series of converging slots 14 engaged by pins 13 fixed to the arms 9. The guide plates are longitudinally stationary but the upper guide plate is arranged to pivot with the upper carriage section 5 so that on forward and pivoting movement of the carriage the pin-and-slot connections cause the arms to converge as they interengage. At the end of each arm 9 is a vertically pivotable finger 10 with a projection 21 anchored to the corresponding guide plate by a coiled spring cable 22. As the carriage nears the end of its forward travel the tension in the springs causes the fingers 10 to pivot away from the pleated material. The operative edges of the arms 9 of each set are covered with a fabric layer. The machine may be used to pleat one end of a tubular casing of regenerated cellulose. In a modification the carriage is longitudinally stationary and the guide plates are movable to effect interengagement and pivoting of the pleating arms.",VISKASE LTD,CHANDLER ARTHUR ROWLAND;;STORER WILLIAM ELWOOD;;DOXSEY JAMES RICHARD,,https://lens.org/058-225-929-921-24X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B29C53/26,B29C53/26,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

As described the peripherals may be magnetic tape units, printers &c. and three modes of operation are described. Interrogate peripheral unit type.-A word is placed in the A register 24 which is the top register in a stack memory. A group of bits identifying the word as an ""interrogate peripheral unit type"" command are decoded and used to gate via gate 26 a further group of bits in the word specifying a particular multiplexor and a channel number to the control lines of the scanbus. These bits are applied to a decoder 28 and via a gate 32 to the gating circuit 34. The gate 32 is enabled by the TYPE output of the decoder and the circuit 34 energizes one or more of its outputs 1-20 in response to the channel designation. The lines 1-20 are connected to respective printed circuit boards 36-40 which generate a coded output specifying the type of peripheral connected to the designated channel. Interrogate peripheral path.-This command verifies the availability of a designated channel. A word is loaded in the A register 24 as above and the operation is similar except that the PATH output of decoder 28 is energized. The outputs 1-20 of the gating circuit 34 pass via AND gates 42-46 respectively which are enabled by the PATH output and also by NOT BUSY signals from the control units associated with the peripherals connected to channels 1-20. The outputs of gates 42-46 are gated to the processor via gate 48. Interrogate status.-This command verifies the availability of the selected peripheral unit, the STATUS output of the decoder 28 being energized as above. A group of bits specifying one of the groups of READY lines from the peripheral units is passed to the decoder 56 which is activated in response to the STATUS output. The READY signals verify the status of the peripheral units and are utilized by the decoder 56 to generate control signals which are applied to the corresponding ones of the gates 50, 52, 54. The selected READY signals are thus gated to the processor. The system may provide for avoiding interrogation of all the READY signals by passing each group of such signals through a corresponding inverter 58, 60, 62 to the gating circuit associated with the next lower order group of READY signals. The output of the inverters indicate that none of the peripheral units is ready and a particular bit in the A-register 24 is set accordingly. The controlling program in response to setting of this bit, inhibits further interrogation.",BURROUGHS CORP,PRICE WILLIAM CHANDLER;;HAUCK ERWIN ARTHUR;;VIGIL JACOB FRANCIS,,https://lens.org/062-720-513-986-843,Granted Patent,no,0,4,8,8,0,G06F15/177,G06F13/10;;G06F15/177,G4A AFD           FD;;G4A AFGDC         FGDC;;G4A AFGDT         FGDT;;G4A A11A          FD;;G4A A11A          G;;G4A A11A          G4A;;G4A A16B          FD;;G4A A16B          G;;G4A A16B          G4A;;G4A A16J          FD;;G4A A16J          G;;G4A A16J          G4A;;G4A A19           FD;;G4A A19           G;;G4A A19           G4A;;G4A A6G           FD;;G4A A6G           G;;G4A A6G           G4A;;G4A A6H           FD;;G4A A6H           G;;G4A A6H           G4A;;G4A A9C           FD;;G4A A9C           G;;G4A A9C           G4A;;G4A A9D           FD;;G4A A9D           G;;G4A A9D           G4A,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

[Also in Division G1] A transistor gating circuit, for use in an electrical measuring system (see Division G1), consists of a transistor T5 and a diode D2. If a negative potential is applied to line 1 a signal from measuring apparatus 12 is applied to the base of the transistor, and diode D2 becomes forward biased as the transistor emitter takes up a negative potential. The measuring signal is then passed through lines S, C to control station 10. While D2 is conductive a negative potential exists on line S to back-bias the diodes associated with all other measuring heads connected to lines S, C. Line 14 is provided to remove the measuring signal from the base of transistor T5 when no bias is applied to line 1. In a modified arrangement diode D16 is connected to the collector of transistor J16, and the output is taken across resistor R36 connected between the emitter and collector.",COAL INDUSTRY PATENTS LTD,CHANDLER KENNETH WILLIAM;;FOOT BERNARD NOEL;;SHILLINGFORD HENRY STEPHEN,,https://lens.org/127-879-669-395-469,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,G08B17/117;;H03K17/6257;;H04Q9/00;;H04Q2209/60,G08B17/117;;H03K17/62;;H04Q9/00,G1N NAHH          AHHD;;G1N NAHHD         AHHD;;G1N N1A2C         AHHD;;G1N N1M           AHHD;;G1N N3S15         AHHD;;G1N N3S4          AHHD;;G1N N7A1          AHHD;;G1N N7B1          AHHD;;H3T T1C1          -;;H3T T1C2          -;;H3T T2A1N         -;;H3T T2A2          -;;H3T T2B3          -;;H3T T2E           -;;H3T T2F4          -;;H3T T2J           -;;H3T T2T3J         -;;H3T T4E1N         -;;H3T T4E2N         -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The jet sled is pulled along a desired path by means of a cable, usually of fixed length, extending from a winch on the barge, and forward movement is supplied by one or more pull-ahead winches which reel in on a forwardly extending cable at a desired rate to permit the trench to be of the desired depth. Sled cable tension is controlled to a desired value by sensing this tension and producing an electrical signal proportional thereto, modifying this signal in a signal-shaping circuit comprising a second order lead-lag filter and comparing the modified signal with a tension reference signal to produce an error signal. The error signal is further modified by a signal representative of velocity and direction of movement of the pull-ahead cable.

The major elements of the invention include: computer hardware, user description of the patient, description of the radiation source, physical databases, Monte Carlo transport, and output of dose distributions. This facilitated the estimation of dose distributions on a Cartesian grid for neutrons, photons, electrons, positrons, and heavy charged-particles incident on any biological target, with resolutions ranging from microns to centimeters.

The major elements of the invention include: computer hardware, user description of the patient, description of the radiation source, physical databases, Monte Carlo transport, and output of dose distributions (15). This facilitated the estimation of dose distributions on a Cartesian grid for neutrons, photons, electrons, positrons, and heavy charged-particles incident on any biological target, with resolutions ranging from microns to centimeters.

The wheels b, c, d are so chosen that the spring f, which is kept sufficiently wound to operate the striking-mechanism, is in the same state after a complete rotation of the hour-hand as before.

BELLING & LEE Ltd. June 18, 1965, No. 25785/65. Heading H1W. [Also in Division H4] An aerial support beam comprises two spaced apart members between which is a two-tube balun whose electrical characteristics are adjustable by altering the spacing between the tubes and by moving a shorting link along them. The beam projects from a tower, to which it is fixed, and an aerial is secured to its projecting part. As described, the beam comprises a metal channel having side walls 45, 46, Fig. 1, the balun tubes 39, 40 being contained therein by means of U shaped blocks (84), (85), (86), (87), Figs. 2 and 4 (not shown), and clamping bars (92), (93). Block (84) at the tower end is made of metal and the others, of insulating material. The insides of the blocks are made wide enough to allow adjustment of the distance between the tubes and two short pieces of channelled metal (102), (103) are interposed between the tubes and the block (84) to prevent any inadvertent rotation. An adjustable short-circuiting clip comprises two tube clamps 104, 105, Fig. 1, embracing the tubes 39, 40 and connected by a copper ring 108. A length of coaxial cable passes through one balun tube and at the tower end of the beam is terminated in a socket 52 which is mounted on a baffle-plate 50 secured in the channel member. A plate (76), Fig. 5 (not shown), for fixing the beam to the tower is welded to the channel member (44) and is strengthened by gusset plates (80), (81). A cover in two parts (57), (58) for the open top of the channel member (44) is held in place by nuts (69) with washers (70) engaging bolts (53), (54) secured to the floor (47). At the end of the beam remote from the tower a plate (48) with a rectangular aperture (49) is fitted to the channel member (44). On this is bolted an aerial junction box 5, Fig. 1, from which extends transversely an aerial dipole formed by two tubes, 1, 2. The dipole may be secured to the beam so that its axis is horizontal (Fig. 8, not shown) or vertical (Fig. 9, not shown). The junction box 5 contains a mass of electrical potting material 6 in which are embedded four lugs 7, 8, 9, 10 which are suitably connected to the dipole tubes 1, 2. Connections between the lugs 7, 9 or 8, 10 and the balun tubes 39, 40 are made by means of tubular connector links 24, 25 which have apertured flattened ends (Fig. 7, not shown). At the balun tubes they engage with screwthreaded shanks (37), (38) which project from the ends thereof (Fig. 6, not shown). The coaxial cable is also connected to an appropriate one of the lugs. Access to the lugs is obtained via an aperture 30, Fig. 1, in the junction-box 5, which is normally covered by a plate 33.",BELLING & LEE LTD,CHANDLER RICHARD DAVID JAMES;;CROCKER ALLEN ARTHUR;;GODFREY NELSON FREDERICK JOHN;;GODFREY WILLIAM THOMAS,,https://lens.org/060-665-579-679-617,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H01Q9/08,H01Q9/08,H1Q QKE           KE;;H1W WFA           WFA;;H1W W11           -;;H1W W13Y          -;;H1W W2            -;;H1W W3B1          -;;H1W W7            -;;H4A A3M           -;;H4A A6D           -;;H4A A8            -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   The invention provides methods, apparatus, and systems for performing high-throughput preparation and screening of salts and polymorphs of drug candidates. The invention is directed towards enhancing the pre-formulation discovery process used for drug development. In particular, processes that determine suitable salts and processes that discover substantially every polymorph that can form from a particular drug candidate are provided. The processes are performed using several apparatuses that are specifically configured to carry-out various steps in a high-throughput characterization process. One such apparatus is configured for synthesizing a plurality of library members based on, for example, a library model generated by a computer system. Another apparatus may filter the synthesized solution to provide a substantially pure mixture that can be subjected to salt or polymorph testing. Yet another apparatus may be used to crystallize mixtures on a substrate such that the crystallized mixture can be screened by one or more screening devices.

   The invention provides methods, apparatus, and systems for performing high-throughput preparation and screening of salts and polymorphs of drug candidates. The invention is directed towards enhancing the pre-formulation discovery process used for drug development. In particular, processes that determine suitable salts and processes that discover substantially every polymorph that can form from a particular drug candidate are provided. The processes are performed using several apparatuses that are specifically configured to carry-out various steps in a high-throughput characterization process. One such apparatus is configured for synthesizing a plurality of library members based on, for example, a library model generated by a computer system. Another apparatus may filter the synthesized solution to provide a substantially pure mixture that can be subjected to salt or polymorph testing. Yet another apparatus may be used to crystallize mixtures on a substrate such that the crystallized mixture can be screened by one or more screening devices.

    A network switch includes a plurality of first network ports coupled to a first bus, a plurality of second network ports coupled to a second bus, a bridge interface enabling data transfer between the buses, a switch manager controlling the flow of network data, and a processor for performing supervisory and control functions. The first and second network ports operate according to different network protocols, and the first and second buses operate according to different bus standards. During packet data transfers across the first bus, the bridge interface emulates a first network port. During packet data transfers across the second bus, the bridge interface primarily acts as a slave to the second network ports by storing control lists for execution by the second network ports, thus relieving the processor of performing overhead functions associated with data transfers across the second bus.

The invention is directed towards enhancing the pre-formulation discovery process used for drug development. In particular, processes that determine suitable salts and processes that discover substantially every polymorph that can form from a particular drug candidate are provided. The processes are performed using several apparatuses that are specifically configured to carry-out various steps in a high-throughput characterization process.

A user interface may be suitable only for some devices (e.g., buttons may be selectable by a pointer, but not on a touch-sensitive display; textboxes may appear too large or too small on different displays), and may satisfy only some user interactions (e.g., a map interface may be usable on a laptop by a stationary user, but not usable in a vehicle while the user is driving). Presented herein are techniques for automatically generating a user interface that is adapted both for the interaction component properties of the device, and the interaction criteria of the user interaction with the user interface. A device may choose the presentation of each element of a user interface based on such information, and generate a user interface matching both the device and the user interaction with the application.",MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC,THRELKELD ELIZABETH FAY;;STAUBER WILLIAM SCOTT;;MIKKOLA PETTERI;;MORAN KERI KRUSE;;KHOURY ISSA Y;;CROSS BRIAN DAVID;;DAVIS DARREN RAY;;SEGA GIORGIO FRANCESCO;;SHIPLEY KENTON ALLEN;;BALASUBRAMANIAN RAMRAJPRABU;;DERKS PATRICK;;RAHMAN MOHAMMED KALEEMUR;;PENDLAY RYAN CHANDLER,,https://lens.org/052-663-061-022-742,Patent Application,no,5,3,5,5,0,G06F8/38;;G06F8/76;;G06F9/44505;;G06F9/451;;H04M1/72454;;G06F9/451;;G06F3/04842;;G06F3/04847;;G06F8/38;;G06F8/76;;G06F9/44505;;H04M1/72454;;G06F3/04847;;G06F3/04842;;G06F9/451;;G06F8/38;;G06F8/76;;G06F9/44505;;H04M1/72454,G06F9/44;;G06F9/445;;H04M1/72454,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Such incorporation may involve a terminal services session that projects the computing environment of the primary device onto the auxiliary device; mirroring the computing environment of the primary device through the auxiliary device; and/or utilizing applications that interoperate with client applications executing on the second device.
