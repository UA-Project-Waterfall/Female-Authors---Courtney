    A method for forming a fine-pitch flip chip assembly interconnects fine pitch devices after they have been connected to a carrier substrate. A die having a plurality of conductive sections, such as solder balls, is attached to a conductive layer of the substrate. An interconnect pattern is then formed in the conductive layer to connect the conductive sections and generate electronic functionality to the assembly. By forming the interconnect pattern after the device have been connected to the carrier, the invention provides precise alignment between the devices and the interconnect pattern without actually aligning the two components during the assembly process.

For example, the control logic may determine that a sudden, but temporary, blockage has occurred in the filter membrane. In response to this, the control logic may initiate a specific response designed to alleviate the blockage. This response may be a temperature change, a vibration, a change in fluid flow path, or some other action. The control logic will then determine the success of the response, based monitoring any change in the fluid characteristics. Based thereon, the control logic may alert the operator that the filter element must be replaced. Alternatively, if the response was successful in correcting the blockage, the control logic need not notify the operator, as the filter element is back to normal operating operation.

In response to the measured characteristic or parameter, the control logic within the filter element is able to determine an appropriate response. For example, the control logic may determine that a sudden, but temporary, blockage has occurred in the filter membrane. In response to this, the control logic may initiate a specific response designed to alleviate the blockage. This response may be a temperature change, a vibration, a change in fluid flow path, or some other action. The control logic will then determine the success of the response, based monitoring any change in the fluid characteristics. Based thereon, the control logic may alert the operator that the filter element must be replaced. Alternatively, if the response was successful in correcting the blockage, the control logic need not notify the operator, as the filter element is back to normal operating operation.

In response to the measured characteristic or parameter, the control logic within the filter element is able to determine an appropriate response. For example, the control logic may determine that a sudden, but temporary, blockage has occurred in the filter membrane. In response to this, the control logic may initiate a specific response designed to alleviate the blockage. This response may be a temperature change, a vibration, a change in fluid flow path, or some other action. The control logic will then determine the success of the response, based monitoring any change in the fluid characteristics. Based thereon, the control logic may alert the operator that the filter element must be replaced. Alternatively, if the response was successful in correcting the blockage, the control logic need not notify the operator, as the filter element is back to normal operating operation.

The CAU (700) includes an RF transceiver (702) that includes a cable interface (704), an UP converter (706), a modulator (708), and a DOWN converter (710). The cable interface (704) provides an interface to either coaxial or fiber-optic cables, whereby RF signals from the UP converter (706) are placed on the spokes (510) and RF signals from the spokes (510) are downloaded to the DOWN converter (710). The modulator (708) processes digital signals into analog signals that are converted to their proper frequency for transmission by the UP converter (706).",MOTOROLA INC,BURKE TIMOTHY M;;MANNETTE MICHAEL;;BAHARY ROB,,https://lens.org/147-405-360-456-738,Patent Application,yes,3,0,10,10,0,H04H60/94;;H04H60/97;;H04J3/0682;;H04L12/2801;;H04H60/94;;H04H60/97;;H04L12/2801;;H04J3/0682,H04H60/94;;H04H60/97;;H04J3/06;;H04L12/28,,0,0,,,,PENDING

An operator may automatically place the library's robotic picker in a ""TDSM mount mode"" when an attached host processor requests one or more data volumes stored on one or more TDSMs. A library-manager controller can be automatically configured to interact with the library's robotic pickers to transfer a TDSM from the input/output station to a device, such as a tape drive within the library. The library manager controller is automatically configured to ignore the machine readable external label of a TDSM so that it is not necessary to place such a label on a TDSM. The controller can notify the operator when processing of the data volume is complete and return the TDSM to the input/output station for ejection from the library.

The telephone (40) is usually waiting for a telephone call. The first subsystem reduces power consumption by having a transceiver (114) for the telephone (40) only monitor for incoming calls periodically and turns off the transceiver (114) when not monitoring for calls. The second subsystem, limits system power consumption and access to channels (36) by only allowing loop current and access to channels (36) when a channel (36) is available for use.

The method includes forming a trench within a semiconductor substrate of a first conductivity type, the trench including sidewalls and a bottom portion. The method further includes forming a substantially uniform gate dielectric in the trench, and forming a gate electrode within said trench and over said gate dielectric. The method also includes doping the semiconductor substrate to form a channel region of a second conductivity type after forming the trench. In one embodiment, the doping step is performed after forming the gate dielectric and after forming the gate electrode. In another embodiment, the doping step is performed after forming the gate dielectric, but prior to forming the gate electrode.

One or more droplets (10) can be interacted with by forming a bridge of liquid (220) and a surface (12) that includes an initial drplet (10) and breaking the bridge of liquid (220) between a dispensing member (100) and a surface (12) that includes one or more of the droplet (10) or droplets (10) and drowing at least a portion of the bridge of liquid (220) into an inner volume of the dispending member (100).",ARRADIAL INC,KALE SAMESH;;SEWARD GEORGE H;;KIM NAMYONG;;CAIN BRIAN;;MOULTON TIMOTHY;;SEPTAK MICHAEL;;BURKE CHARLES;;BOURN DOUGLAS,,https://lens.org/136-399-248-628-379,Search Report,yes,5,0,7,7,0,B01J2219/00367;;B01L3/0262;;B01L3/5088;;B01L2200/143;;B01L2300/0838;;B01L2400/022;;B01L2400/0433;;C40B60/14;;G01F25/0092;;G01F25/0084;;B01L3/0262;;B01L3/5088;;B01L2400/022;;B01L2400/0433;;C40B60/14;;B01L2200/143;;B01J2219/00367;;B01L2300/0838,B01J4/02;;B01L3/00;;G01N1/00;;B01L3/02;;C40B60/14;;G01N35/10,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The tube is able to expand longitudinally along the length-wise axis of the hose between hose ends, as well as radially or circumferentially, to an expanded state in response to application of at least a minimum fluid pressure to an inner tube of the hose. Once the fluid pressure falls below the minimum fluid pressure, the hose assembly will contract. The two layer construction of the hose assembly allows for storage in relatively compact spaces, similar flow rates, approximately one-half the weight, and improved maneuverability when compared to conventional hose constructions.

In one embodiment the jacket is formed around the tube in a continuous process that welds a fabric, preferably using hot air, into the jacket.

The invention further provides a method of producing a deacidified lignin. The method involves contacting an acidic lignin with a hydrocarbon solvent; and heating the hydrocarbon solvent to remove an acid from the acidic lignin thereby obtaining the deacidified lignin.
