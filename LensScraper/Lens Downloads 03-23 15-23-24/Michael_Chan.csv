In addition, new insights into methods for coagulum reduction during RF ablation will be presented, and a quantitative model for ascertaining the propensity for coagulum formation during RF ablation will be introduced. Effective practical techniques a represented for multichannel simultaneous RF energy delivery with real-time calculation of the Coagulum Index, which estimates the probability of coagulum formation. This information is used in a feedback and control algorithm which effectively reduces the probability of coagulum formation during ablation. For each ablation channel, electrical coupling delivers an RF electrical current through an ablation electrode of the ablation catheter and a temperature sensor is positioned relative to the ablation electrode for measuring the temperature of cardiac tissue in contact with the ablation electrode. A current sensor is provided within each channel circuitry for measuring the current delivered through said electrical coupling and an information processor and RF output controller coupled to said temperature sensor and said current sensor for estimating the likelihood of coagulum formation. When this functionality is propagated simultaneously through multiple ablation channels, the resulting linear or curvilinear lesion is deeper with less gaps.

A dispersed catalyst suspension is passed upwardly at a velocity of 0.15 to 1.22 m/sec (0.5 to 4 ft/sec). Atomized feedstock is injected downwardly at a velocity relative to the catalyst velocity of -9 to -305 m/sec (-30 to -1000 ft./sec) to produce a turbulently mixed reaction suspension. Vaporizing feedstock rapidly accelerates the reaction suspension in approximately plug flow. The slip factor between catalyst and hydrocarbon in the reaction suspension defining the departure from ideal plug flow is thereby reduced.,TEXACO DEVELOPMENT CORP,DACH MICHAEL MARKEL;;CHAN HENRY CHOISUN CHAN;;CHAN TING YEE,,https://lens.org/075-694-959-726-347,Patent Application,yes,4,0,7,7,0,B01J8/0015;;B01J8/0015;;C10G11/18;;C10G11/18,B01J8/00;;C10G11/18,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

In addition, new insights into methods for coagulum reduction during RF ablation will be presented, and a quantitative model for ascertaining the propensity for coagulum formation during RF ablation will be introduced. Effective practical techniques a represented for multichannel simultaneous RF energy delivery with real-time calculation of the Coagulum Index, which estimates the probability of coagulum formation. This information is used in a feedback and control algorithm which effectively reduces the probability of coagulum formation during ablation. For each ablation channel, electrical coupling delivers an RF electrical current through an ablation electrode of the ablation catheter and a temperature sensor is positioned relative to the ablation electrode for measuring the temperature of cardiac tissue in contact with the ablation electrode. A current sensor is provided within each channel circuitry for measuring the current delivered through said electrical coupling and an information processor and RF output controller coupled to said temperature sensor and said current sensor for estimating the likelihood of coagulum formation. When this functionality is propagated simultaneously through multiple ablation channels, the resulting linear or curvilinear lesion is deeper with less gaps.

Various embodiments of the technology includes a proxy server that facilitates transmission of notifications to the computing devices based on a location proximity and/or access pattern of the computing devices. The proxy server transmits the notifications to the devices based on their location proximity with a primary device of the user, e.g., a device which the user uses more often than others. For example, if a particular device is not within a predefined location proximity of the primary device, the proxy server delays the transmission of notifications to the particular device until the particular device is in the predefined location proximity. In another example, a transmission frequency of the notifications is continuously adjusted based on the location proximity, e.g., the transmission frequency is increased as the proximity increases, and is decreased as the proximity decreases.",NEXTBIT SYSTEMS INC,CHAN MICHAEL A;;QUAN JUSTIN,RAZER (ASIA-PACIFIC) PTE.

A blockchain compression system may determine that a blockchain compression condition associated with a blockchain having a first plurality of blocks has been satisfied. In response, the system compresses the first plurality of blocks using a first hash tree into a first root hash value and stores the first plurality of blocks in a first database. The blockchain compression system generates a first new era genesis block that includes the first root hash value and a first database address of the first database at which the first plurality of blocks are stored. The blockchain compression system stores the blockchain at one or more nodes in a blockchain network. The blockchain includes the first new era genesis block and any previous new era genesis blocks.

   A physical layer device (PLD) includes a first serializer-deserializer (SERDES) device and a second SERDES device. Each SERDES device includes an analog portion with a serial port that is configured to communicate serial data with various network devices, and a digital portion that is configured to communicate parallel data with other various network devices. The PLD includes a first signal path that is configured to route serial data signals between the analog portions of the SERDES devices, bypassing the digital portions of the SERDES devices. Therefore, the SERDES devices can directly communicate serial data without performing parallel data conversion. A second signal path is configured to route recovered clock and data signals between the analog portions of the SERDES devices, but still bypassing the digital portions of the SERDES devices. The recovered clock and data signals are then regenerated before being transmitted over a network device. Signal latency and hardware requirements are reduced by bypassing the digital portions of the SERDES devices and avoiding the parallel conversion associated with the digital portions.

Effective practical techniques a represented for multichannel simultaneous RF energy delivery with real-time calculation of the Coagulum Index, which estimates the probability of coagulum formation. This information is used in a feedback and control algorithm which effectively reduces the probability of coagulum formation during ablation. For each ablation channel, electrical coupling delivers an RF electrical current through an ablation electrode of the ablation catheter and a temperature sensor is positioned relative to the ablation electrode for measuring the temperature of cardiac tissue in contact with the ablation electrode. A current sensor is provided within each channel circuitry for measuring the current delivered through said electrical coupling and an information processor and RF output controller coupled to said temperature sensor and said current sensor for estimating the likelihood of coagulum formation. When this functionality is propagated simultaneously through multiple ablation channels, the resulting linear or curvilinear lesion is deeper with less gaps.

   A system for efficient delivery of radio frequency (RF) energy to cardiac tissue with an ablation catheter used in catheter ablation, with new concepts regarding the interaction between RF energy and biological tissue. In addition, new insights into methods for coagulum reduction during RF ablation will be presented, and a quantitative model for ascertaining the propensity for coagulum formation during RF ablation will be introduced. Effective practical techniques a represented for multichannel simultaneous RF energy delivery with real-time calculation of the Coagulum Index, which estimates the probability of coagulum formation. This information is used in a feedback and control algorithm which effectively reduces the probability of coagulum formation during ablation. For each ablation channel, electrical coupling delivers an RF electrical current through an ablation electrode of the ablation catheter and a temperature sensor is positioned relative to the ablation electrode for measuring the temperature of cardiac tissue in contact with the ablation electrode. A current sensor is provided within each channel circuitry for measuring the current delivered through said electrical coupling and an information processor and RF output controller coupled to said temperature sensor and said current sensor for estimating the likelihood of coagulum formation. When this functionality is propagated simultaneously through multiple ablation channels, the resulting linear or curvilinear lesion is deeper with less gaps. Hence, the clinical result is improved due to improved lesion integrity.

Each towel in the interleaved stack of towels in the present invention is comprised of a sheet which has been folded in half to substantially create a two-ply arrangement. A second fold is imparted to the towel substantially to the first fold thereby creating a lead flap and a trailing flap. The lead flap begins with the first fold and thereby creates a tab end which is two-ply and which will not delaminate on dispensing. The user will thus always be grasping a two-ply product as it is being dispensed thereby minimizing tear-out and tab-out failure.

The PLD includes a first signal path that is configured to route serial data signals between the analog portions of the SERDES devices, bypassing the digital portions of the SERDES devices. Therefore, the SERDES devices can directly communicate serial data without performing parallel data conversion. A second signal path is configured to route recovered clock and data signals between the analog portions of the SERDES devices, but still bypassing the digital portions of the SERDES devices. The recovered clock and data signals are then regenerated before being transmitted over a network device.

The user will thus always be grasping a two-ply product as it is being dispensed thereby minimizing tear-out and tab-out failure.

Once the set of top fans is identified, content creators can interact, potentially exclusively, with the set of top fans, which can enhance the experience for all parties involved.",GOOGLE INC,LEE-CHAN JEFFREY;;SCHNEIDER MICHAEL PATRICK,GOOGLE LLC (2017-09-29),https://lens.org/050-008-130-246-341,Granted Patent,yes,11,0,2,2,0,G06Q50/01;;G06Q50/01;;G06F3/0481;;G06F3/0484;;G06F16/24578;;G06F16/24578;;G06F16/9535;;G06F16/9535;;G06F16/958;;G06F16/958;;G06Q30/0201;;G06Q30/0201,G06F17/30;;G06F3/0481;;G06F3/0484;;G06Q30/02;;G06Q50/00,,2,0,,,"Notice of Allowance dated Mar. 2, 2016 in U.S. Appl.

In one embodiment, shared locks on a resource are granted more efficiently by maintaining data that is local to (e.g. on the same node as) each entity to indicate whether an exclusive lock has been granted on the resource to any entity of the plurality of entities. Data that ( 15 ) is maintained local to an entity, and that ( 16 ) indicates whether any entity has an exclusive lock on a particular resource is referred to herein as a “local exclusive lock flag” for that particular resource. When an entity of the plurality of entities seeks to acquire a shared lock for a particular resource, that entity checks the local exclusive lock flag for that particular resource. If the local exclusive lock flag indicates that no entity holds an exclusive lock on the resource, then the entity seeking the shared lock acquires the shared lock without first receiving a lock grant from the resource manager that manages the resource. In many cases, the resource manager that manages the resource is remotely located relative to the entity that desires the shared lock. Because the local exclusive lock flag is local, the act of checking it does not incur the overhead associated with communicating with a remotely located resource manager. Thus, obtaining a shared lock based on the state of a local exclusive lock flag significantly increases the efficiency of managing access to the resource, particularly for resources for which entities do not frequently require exclusive access.",ORACLE INT CORP,CHAN WILSON WAI SHUN;;ZOLL MICHAEL,ORACLE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION (2003-04-11);;ORACLE CORPORATION (2000-12-18),https://lens.org/185-757-122-271-604,Granted Patent,yes,9,64,1,5,0,G06F16/2343;;G06F16/2343;;Y10S707/99952;;Y10S707/99938,G06F17/30,707/8;;707/10;;707/201;;710/200;;711/150;;711/151;;711/152,9,0,,,"Rahm, Erhard, ""Concurrency and Coherency Control in Database Sharing Systems"", Technical Report ZRI, Dec. 1991, Revised: Mar. 1993, pp. 1-62.;;Lory D.

Therefore, the SERDES devices can directly communicate serial data without performing parallel data conversion. A second signal path is configured to route recovered clock and data signals between the analog portions of the SERDES devices, but still bypassing the digital portions of the SERDES devices. The recovered clock and data signals are then regenerated before being transmitted over a network device.",BROADCOM CORP,CHAN KEVIN T;;LE MICHAEL Q,AVAGO TECHNOLOGIES GENERAL IP (SINGAPORE) PTE.

   A switching technique allows multiple interconnect bus devices to be connected to a single bus segment, even if the interconnect bus protocol only allows a one of the interconnect devices to be connected at any time. Each of the interconnect devices is connected to the interconnect bus segment with a switch, such that the interconnect device is electrically isolated from the interconnect bus segment when the switch is open. An interconnect sourcing agent connected to the interconnect bus segment controls the switches, closing the switch for one of the interconnect devices when a transaction is destined for that interconnect device, opening all of the other switches so that only one device is connected to the bus at any time.

A second fold is imparted to the towel substantially to the first fold thereby creating a lead flap and a trailing flap. The lead flap begins with the first fold and thereby creates a tab end which is two-ply and which will not delaminate on dispensing. The user will thus always be grasping a two-ply product as it is being dispensed thereby minimizing tear-out and tab-out failure.

   A method and system for cleaning collector optics in a light source chamber. In producing, for example, extreme ultraviolet light for lithography, debris such as tungsten can accumulate on optical components near a light source in the light source chamber. 

   An etchant, such as a fluorine-containing gas, can be introduced into the light source chamber. The etchant is ionized via electrodes to generate free fluorine. The electrodes can be, for example, existing light source chamber components including the optical components. The fluorine can then react with the debris, forming gaseous compounds, which are pumped out of the light source chamber.

A layer of resist is applied over the boundary of a region in which a bump of a deposited material is to be formed. The resist layer is applied by a screen printing process in which the portion of the screen overlying the region is blocked so that no resist is deposited where the bump is to be formed. The screen is open in the areas surrounding the blocked portion, permitting resist to be deposited over any non-planar surfaces surrounding the intended bump location. This provides a substantially planar surface which may be used as a mask for direct paste deposition into the region where the bump is to be formed, or the planar surface may be used as a flat surface upon which a stencil may be supported.

    This invention provides novel substrate compounds that selectively inhibit the proliferation of pathological cells, for example, pathological calls that endogenously overexpress a target enzyme that confers resistance to biologic and chemotherapeutic agents. The enzyme acts on a substrate compound to 1) convert it to a cellular toxin and/or 2) release a toxic byproduct. In one embodiment, the activity of the target enzyme has been greatly enhanced in a target cell as a result of loss of tumor suppressor function and/or selection resulting from previous exposure to chemotherapy. In another embodiment, the pathological cell contains a target enzyme that is an expression product of an infectious agent in the cell. Further provided by this invention is a method for treating a subject by delivering to the subject a prodrug as described herein.

The enzyme acts on a substrate compound to 1) convert it to a cellular toxin and/or 2) release a toxic byproduct. In one embodiment, the activity of the target enzyme has been greatly enhanced in a target cell as a result of loss of tumor suppressor function and/or selection resulting from previous exposure to chemotherapy.

The computing device detects an identity of a network to which a computing device is connected or is to be connected during a network identification process executed on the computing device. The network can be identified, e.g., by examining a subscriber identification module (SIM) card electronically connected to the computing device. The device then sends a request including the identity of the network to a remote registration service. In turn the device receives an instruction from the remote registration service identifying a distribution of an operating system (OS) specific for the network.

The computing device detects an identity of a network to which a computing device is connected or is to be connected during a network identification process executed on the computing device. The network can be identified, e.g., by examining a subscriber identification module (SIM) card electronically connected to the computing device. The device then sends a request including the identity of the network to a remote registration service. In turn the device receives an instruction from the remote registration service identifying a distribution of an operating system (OS) specific for the network.

A source application can serialize the object using multiple serialization schemes. In order for another application to deserialize the object serialized by the source application, the application may have to know the serialization scheme used in serializing the object. The technology can analyze an intermediate code, e.g., bytecode, of the source application to determine the serialization scheme used by the source application. The technology compares a portion of the code of the source application that serializes the objects with multiple serialization scheme templates having code for known serialization schemes and determines the serialization scheme used by the source application based on a matching serialization scheme template.
