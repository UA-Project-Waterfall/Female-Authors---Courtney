A main boom is pivotally coupled to the tower boom nose pin at an opposite end of the tower boom. Raising and lowering of the tower boom between a fully retracted position and a raised position is effected by pivoting the tower boom relative to the vehicle base and telescoping the tower boom. The raised position is defined according to any position up to a maximum angle of the tower boom relative to the vehicle base and a maximum boom length. In order to reduce vehicle weight and expedite the tower boom lift function, pivoting of the tower boom relative to the vehicle base and telescoping of the tower boom are performed simultaneously so that the tower boom nose pin follows the predetermined path.

The presence of the ether also improves the second stage chain formation. Utilization of both the mixed coupling agents and the ether, preferably a diether such as 1,2-diethoxyethane gives the greatest control over the uniformity of the second stage polymerization, making possible the production of narrower molecular weight distribution polymer having no indication of bimodal distribution.

The present invention distributes the virtualization mapping in multiple parallel, mapping agents that are separate from a controller. This allows the performance-sensitive mapping process to be parallelized and distributed optimally for performance, while the control of the mapping may be located in a controller chosen for optimal cost, management, and other implementation practicalities. The mapping agents store the virtual mapping tables in volatile memory, substantially reducing the cost and complexity of implementing the mapping agents. The controller is responsible for persistent storage of mapping tables, thereby consolidating the costs and management for persistent mapping table storage in a single component. Distributed virtualization also allows the controller to manage multiple virtual disks used by multiple host systems, and allows a single virtual disk to be shared by multiple host systems. The mapping agents preferably do not interact only with other mapping agents, thereby improving the scalability of the virtual storage system and the virtual storage system's tolerance of component failures.",COMPAQ COMPUTER CORP,REUTER JAMES M;;THIEL DAVID;;BEAN ROBERT;;WRENN RICHARD F,"HEWLETT-PACKARD DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, L.P.

The present invention distributes the virtualization mapping in multiple parallel, mapping agents that are separate from a controller. This allows the performance-sensitive mapping process to be parallelized and distributed optimally for performance, while the control of the mapping may be located in a controller chosen for optimal cost, management, and other implementation practicalities. The mapping agents store the virtual mapping tables in volatile memory, substantially reducing the cost and complexity of implementing the mapping agents. The controller is responsible for persistent storage of mapping tables, thereby consolidating the costs and management for persistent mapping table storage in a single component. Distributed virtualization also allows the controller to manage multiple virtual disks used by multiple host systems, and allows a single virtual disk to be shared by multiple host systems. The mapping agents preferably do not interact only with other mapping agents, thereby improving the scalability of the virtual storage system and the virtual storage system's tolerance of component failures.

In a system having a virtual disk (the “original disk”), a persistent mapping table for this virtual disk exists on a controller, and volatile copies of some or all entries in this mapping table are distributed to one or more more mapping agents. The method of the present invention creates a new virtual disk mapping table that has the exact same entries as the mapping table as the original virtual disk. The new snapshot disk then shares the same storage as the original disk, so it is space efficient. Furthermore, creating new snapshot disk involves only copying the contents of the mapping table, not moving data, so the creation is fast.

   A system for moving physically stored data in a distributed, virtualized storage network is disclosed. A group of data sets is written to a first storage device as part of a write operation such as migration. A plurality of storage devices partially filled with data are designated as substitutes. The write operation to the first storage device is suspended upon receiving a request to read a data set stored in the first storage device, such as occurs in a recall operation. A second storage device is then selected from the plurality of substitute storage devices. The write operation is continued by writing data sets from the group of data sets included in the write operation that were not written to the first storage device to the selected second storage device. The requested data is then read from the first storage device. After data has been read from the first storage device, the first storage device may be designated as a substitute storage device so that the partially filled first storage device may be selected for continuing write operations. Data sets from substitute storage devices may be transferred or merged into a lesser number of storage devices during recycle operations to prevent the number of substitute storage devices from increasing beyond a predetermined limit or goal. Recycling operations in which data sets from different storage devices are transferred or merged may be performed by building a first queue including a list of filled tapes ordered according to the least amount of valid data and a second queue including all unassociated partially filled storage devices ordered by the amount of available storage space, and merging.

The method of the present invention creates a new virtual disk mapping table that has the exact same entries as the mapping table as the original virtual disk. The new snapshot disk then shares the same storage as the original disk, so it is space efficient. Furthermore, creating new snapshot disk involves only copying the contents of the mapping table, not moving data, so the creation is fast. In order to allow multiple virtual disks to share storage segments, writes to either the original virtual disk or the snapshot copy cannot be seen by the other. Therefore, in addition to simply copying the mapping table, both the original and snapshot disk mapping table must also cause writes to these disks to be handled specially. Finally, any changes to the original disk mapping table stored in the controller must be coordinated with the volatile copies stored in the mapping agent in such a way so that all hosts see a consistent view of that disk.",REUTER JAMES M;;THIEL DAVID W;;WRENN RICHARD F;;BEAN ROBERT G,REUTER JAMES M;;THIEL DAVID W;;WRENN RICHARD F;;BEAN ROBERT G,HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT LP (2015-10-27),https://lens.org/084-181-173-350-969,Patent Application,yes,3,26,16,16,0,G06F3/0605;;G06F3/0605;;G06F3/0608;;G06F3/0608;;G06F3/061;;G06F3/061;;G06F3/0611;;G06F3/0611;;G06F3/0614;;G06F3/0614;;G06F3/0617;;G06F3/0617;;G06F3/064;;G06F3/064;;G06F3/0647;;G06F3/0647;;G06F3/065;;G06F3/065;;G06F3/0665;;G06F3/0665;;G06F3/067;;G06F3/067;;G06F3/0683;;G06F3/0683;;G06F11/0727;;G06F11/0727;;G06F11/0772;;G06F11/0772;;G06F11/0793;;G06F11/0793;;G06F11/1435;;G06F11/1435;;G06F11/1451;;G06F11/1451,G06F3/06;;G06F11/14;;G06F12/00;;G06F12/08;;G06F12/10;;G06F13/14,711/165;;711/162,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The flow splitter communicates with the outlet of the pump and the inlet of the brake assist device and is operative when the back pressure from the brake assist device exceeds a predetermined control value to divert a fraction of the flow of fluid around the brake assist device directly to the steering assist device, thereby providing sufficient flow to operate both the brake and steering assist devices within their normal design limits, rather than having the brake assist device starve the steering assist device when under heavy load.

   The present invention provides a system and method for creating virtualized storage in a storage area network using distributed table-driven input/output mapping. The present invention distributes the virtualization mapping in multiple parallel, mapping agents that are separate from a controller. This allows the performance-sensitive mapping process to be parallelized and distributed optimally for performance, while the control of the mapping may be located in a controller chosen for optimal cost, management, and other implementation practicalities. The mapping agents store the virtual mapping tables in volatile memory, substantially reducing the cost and complexity of implementing the mapping agents. The controller is responsible for persistent storage of mapping tables, thereby consolidating the costs and management for persistent mapping table storage in a single component. Distributed virtualization also allows the controller to manage multiple virtual disks used by multiple host systems, and allows a single virtual disk to be shared by multiple host systems. The mapping agents preferably do not interact only with other mapping agents, thereby improving the scalability of the virtual storage system and the virtual storage system's tolerance of component failures.

    A system for moving physically stored data in a distributed, virtualized storage network is disclosed. A group of data sets is written to a first storage device as part of a write operation such as migration. A plurality of storage devices partially filled with data are designated as substitutes. The write operation to the first storage device is suspended upon receiving a request to read a data set stored in the first storage device, such as occurs in a recall operation. A second storage device is then selected from the plurality of substitute storage devices. The write operation is continued by writing data sets from the group of data sets included in the write operation that were not written to the first storage device to the selected second storage device. The requested data is then read from the first storage device. After data has been read from the first storage device, the first storage device may be designated as a substitute storage device so that the partially filled first storage device may be selected for continuing write operations. Data sets from substitute storage devices may be transferred or merged into a lesser number of storage devices during recycle operations to prevent the number of substitute storage devices from increasing beyond a predetermined limit or goal. Recycling operations in which data sets from different storage devices are transferred or merged may be performed by building a first queue including a list of filled tapes ordered according to the least amount of valid data and a second queue including all unassociated partially filled storage devices ordered by the amount of available storage space, and merging.

Contacting of the final step in the process, which frequently but not necessarily always will be the second step in the process, will be carried out in the presence of a polar compound suitable for increasing the amount of vinyl content in a conjugated diolefin polymer during polymerization thereof. The method used narrows the relative arm distribution of the several asymmetric radial polymers produced and significantly increases the amount of total product having the desired ratio of polymeric arms and accomplishes this objective in relatively short reaction time.

The cutting tool is mounted to a support plate which is pivotably attached to the work table. The elevating mechanism includes a threaded rod and a nut which engages a pivoting link. The pivoting link also engages the cutting tool. Rotation of the threaded rod pivots the link which in turn raises and lowers the cutting tool. A spring biases the cutting tool towards its lower position to remove play between the components. The angulating mechanism includes a lever, two cams and a locking rod. Rotation of the lever moves the locking rod longitudinally due to the action between the two cams. The longitudinal movement of the rod compresses the support plate between the work table and a bracket to maintain the position of the support plate with respect to the work table. Also included is an integral arbor wrench which is accessible when the throat plate is removed to lock the arbor to facilitate tool changing.

An ownership interlock prevents any processor ownership change to occur (i.e. exclusive or readonly ownership) for a cache data unit until all outstanding stores have been made in the cache data unit, after which the ownership may be changed. An ownership change may be signalled by a cross-invalidate (XI) signal to a processor. Outstanding stores are received by the pipeline after the stores are completed by a processor, and the outstanding stores output from the pipeline into a store-in cache. A continuous flow of stores is enabled into and out of the pipeline to expedite a change of ownership requested of a data unit in the cache.

The target aircraft, traveling on the same predetermined route but at an altitude between the sensor aircraft and the ground (background) passes beneath the sensor aircraft. The camera on the sensor aircraft captures a series of images including a reference image immediately before the target aircraft enters the image frame followed by several data images as the target aircraft passes through the image frame. The data images are processed to calculate density gradients around the target aircraft. These density gradients include shockwaves, vortices, engine exhaust, and wakes. Air density gradients cause a refractive index change in the fluid and a slight distortion in the background pattern of the data image.

   A machine tool has a work table which defines a working surface and has a cutting tool which is attached to and movable with respect to the work table. The position of the cutting tool with respect to the working surface is controlled by a mechanism which elevates the cutting tool with respect to the working surface and angulates the cutting tool with respect to the working surface. The cutting tool is mounted to a support plate which is pivotably attached to the work table. The elevating mechanism includes a threaded rod and a nut which engages a pivoting link. The pivoting link also engages the cutting tool. Rotation of the threaded rod pivots the link which in turn raises and lowers the cutting tool. A spring biases the cutting tool towards its lower position to remove play between the components. The angulating mechanism includes a lever, two cams and a locking rod. Rotation of the lever moves the locking rod longitudinally due to the action between the two cams. The longitudinal movement of the rod compresses the support plate between the work table and a bracket to maintain the position of the support plate with respect to the work table. Also included is an integral arbor wrench which is accessible when the throat plate is removed to lock the arbor to facilitate tool changing. The wrench is designed to not allow reassembling of the throat plate when the wrench is in engagement with the arbor shaft.
