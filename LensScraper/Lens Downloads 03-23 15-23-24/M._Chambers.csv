The process comprises introducing wet solid material into a dryer bringing the material into contact with one side of a plurality of heated surfaces located in the dryer and vaporizing liquid contained in the wet solid material. The vaporized liquid is withdrawn from the dryer and compressed to a pressure greater than the pressure in the dryer and then returned to the other side of the plurality of heated surfaces where, upon condensation, the latent heat energy is released therefrom and is used to vaporize liquid contained in wet solid material on the opposite side of the heated surfaces and withdrawing the condensate from the heated surfaces and substantially dried solids from the dryer. The drying apparatus provided comprises a housing having entrance and exit openings and means for delivering material to be dried into and dried material from the housing located in the opening and closing and isolating the interior of the dryer from the outside atmosphere. A plurality of hollow heat exchange means are disposed in the interior or the dryer housing and are connected to an external heat source and to the atmosphere, In addition, compressor means are connected to the housing in the vicinity of the entrance opening and to the hollow heat exchange means, the compressor means operating at positive pressure with respect to the pressure in the housing so that vaporized liquid is withdrawn from the housing or compressed and then led to the hollow heat exchange means where it is condensed, giving up its latent heat energy and thus vaporizing the liquid in wet solid material on the opposite surfaces of the hollow heat exchange means.",CHAMBERS JOHN M,CHAMBERS JOHN M,,https://lens.org/155-199-000-274-91X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,,F26B3/02;;F26B3/18;;F26B19/00;;F26B25/00,34-47,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In a preferred embodiment, a computer system according to the invention includes a network computer that receives particular product/service descriptions and buyer-specified price ceilings from financially committed buyers. The system then initiates a reverse auction amongst accredited potential vendors who bid against one another in an effort to secure the sale. Upon the auction's closing, the accredited vendor that offered the most favorable terms to the buyer is awarded the sale. The vendor is then paid and the product or service delivered or provided to the buyer.

It borrows two techniques from geophysical inversion problems, layer stripping and stacking, and combines them with a model-based estimation algorithm that minimizes the mean-square error between the predicted signal and the data. The technique is designed to process multiple looks from an ultra wideband radar array. The processed signal is time-gated and each section processed to detect the presence of a wall and estimate its position, thickness, and material parameters. The floor plan of a building is determined by moving the array around the outside of the building.

An end surface of the projection increases the available surface area for heat exchange with a cross flow whilst a coolant air flow jetted from the jet aperture can transgress a proportion of the air flow passing between the end surface and a junction surface incorporating the jet aperture. A spacing gap B between the end surface and the junction surface avoids localised distortions to the cross flow whilst the projection provides that the coolant air flow projected from the jet aperture mostly passes through a lower turbulence wake downstream of the projection for greater impingement upon a target surface for heat transfer and cooling efficiency. Typically the impingement cooling arrangement is incorporated within turbine blades or vanes of a jet engine.,ROLLS ROYCE PLC,CHAMBERS ANDREW;;IRELAND PETER;;GILLESPIE DAVID R H;;DAILEY GEOFFREY M,ROLLS-ROYCE PLC (2004-12-23),https://lens.org/140-813-718-017-19X,Patent Application,yes,10,15,4,4,0,F01D5/187;;F01D25/12;;F05D2250/231;;F05D2250/292;;F05D2260/201;;F05D2260/2212;;F05D2260/22141;;Y02T50/60;;F01D25/12;;F05D2250/292;;F05D2260/2212;;F05D2250/231;;F05D2260/201;;F01D5/187;;F05D2260/22141;;Y02T50/60,F01D5/18;;F02C7/12;;F01D25/12,415/115;;X416 97  R,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

    In a method for acquiring statistical information from data, an initial cumulative distribution function (CDF) that characterizes an initial set of data is acquired. The acquisition of this CDF comprises acquiring a set of quantile endpoints that define the CDF. At least one additional CDF, which characterizes a further set of data, is also acquired. Information that describes the initial CDF is combined with information that describes one or more additional CDFs, and the result is used to obtain a composite CDF that describes a combined set of data that includes the initial data set and the one or more further data sets. Then, a new set of quantile endpoints is determined, that defines the composite CDF. The sequence of steps described above is repeated at least once more. The previously obtained composite CDF is used as the initial CDF for each repetition of this sequence.

    An apparatus and method for detecting explosive-indicating compounds in subsurface soil. The apparatus has a probe with an adsorbent material on some portion of its surface that can be placed into soil beneath the ground surface, where the adsorbent material can adsorb at least one explosive-indicating compound. The apparatus additional has the capability to desorb the explosive-indicating compound through heating or solvent extraction. A diagnostic instrument attached to the probe detects the desorbed explosive-indicating compound. In the method for detecting explosive-indicating compounds in soil, the sampling probe with an adsorbent material on at least some portion of a surface of the sampling probe is inserted into the soil to contact the adsorbent material with the soil. The explosive-indicating compounds are then desorbed and transferred as either a liquid or gas sample to a diagnostic tool for analysis. The resulting gas or liquid sample is analyzed using at least one diagnostic tool selected from the group consisting of an ion-mobility spectrometer, a gas chromatograph, a high performance liquid chromatograph, a capillary electrophoresis chromatograph, a mass spectrometer, a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer and a Raman spectrometer to detect the presence of explosive-indicating compounds.

SOLUTION: This electrophotographic image forming member has a substrate, an electric charge generating layer contg. photoconductive dye particles, a 1st film forming binder and 2,6-di-tert.-butyl-4-methylphenol and an electric charge transferring layer. The electric charge generating layer exists between the substrate and the electric charge transferring layer. The substrate may contain an electrically nonconductive or conductive material, e.g. a layer of an inorg. or org. compsn. A flexible resin such as polyester or polycarbonate in the form of a thin web may be used as the electrically nonconductive material. When the substrate is electrically conductive, it is not required to coat the substrate with an electrically conductive coating material. If the substrate is an electric insulator, it is usually coated with an electrically conductive layer.

   In a method for acquiring statistical information from data, an initial cumulative distribution function (CDF) that characterizes an initial set of data is acquired. The acquisition of this CDF comprises acquiring a set of quantile endpoints that define the CDF. At least one additional CDF, which characterizes a further set of data, is also acquired. Information that describes the initial CDF is combined with information that describes one or more additional CDFs, and the result is used to obtain a composite CDF that describes a combined set of data that includes the initial data set and the one or more further data sets. Then, a new set of quantile endpoints is determined, that defines the composite CDF. The sequence of steps described above is repeated at least once more. The previously obtained composite CDF is used as the initial CDF for each repetition of this sequence.

   A system and method provides a holding member for releasably positioning a rotating control head assembly in a subsea housing. The holding member engages an internal formation in the subsea housing to resist movement of the rotating control head assembly relative to the subsea housing. The rotating control head assembly is sealed with the subsea housing when the holding member engages the internal formation. An extendible portion of the holding member assembly extrudes an elastomer between an upper portion and a lower portion of the internal housing to seal the rotating control head assembly with the subsea housing. Pressure relief mechanisms release excess pressure in the subsea housing and a pressure compensation mechanism pressurize bearings in the bearing assembly at a predetermined pressure.

Depending on the magnitude of the change (if any) a positive or negative result is indicated visually by electronics means such as LED's 20, 22. In a preferred embodiment, two sensors 16a, 16b are used. One of these receives a sample of gas 24 which has passed through an ammonia-absorbing means 30 such as sodium dihydrogen phosphate or copper sulphate on a porous frit to provide a corrected baseline value for the ammonia. Porous frit 28 balances the gas flow to the two sensors. An antacid or sparkling water may be administered orally to a subject before the test. The chambers 2a, 2b can be expandable and can have an exit vent to assist gas flow.
