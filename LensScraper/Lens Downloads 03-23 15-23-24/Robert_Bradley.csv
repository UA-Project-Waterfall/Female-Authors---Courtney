   A top section for an oven formed with an outer support shell, an intermediate insulating layer and an inner refractory lining wherein the three layers are connected by a plurality of spaced members. The spaced members are preferably formed as stainless steel pegs welded to an inner surface of the outer support shell extending across the intermediate insulating layer and fixed to the inner refractory lining as a result of the cast refractory lining setting around the pegs. The pegs may be covered at least in part by a plastic tip or coating to provide a relative expansion capacity between the pegs and the refractory lining. The outer section is preferably formed from steel, may be any suitable shape and includes one or more apertures to form doorways, flues and access ports for accessory items such as char-grilles, lights, fire retardant systems and windows. The invention extends to an oven including a top section as disclosed. The invention also extends to a method of forming an oven comprising the steps of forming the outer housing, welding pegs to an inner surface of the outer housing, locating insulating material inside the outer housing, positioning a mould defining a cavity of the top section and pouring and setting a castable refractory lining of the oven. The method may further include the step of positioning plastic tips over the pegs.

The second component is an electrically conductive, particulate component such as, for example, metallic silver which enhances the conductivity and actively reduces the resistance by supplying multiple, parallel conductive paths for electrical current flow, filling in surface irregularities in the contacts, and penetrating surface films. The conductive component may be in powder, coarse pigment, or flake form. Upon application to electrical contacts, the present material increases and maintains conductivity at the heightened level.",MICRO CIRCUITS COMPANY,BRADLEY ROBERT F,MICRO-CIRCUITS COMPANY A CORP.OF OH (1983-08-10),https://lens.org/197-297-156-740-449,Granted Patent,yes,5,226,1,1,0,H01B1/22;;H01B1/24;;H01H1/60;;H01R4/58;;H01R13/03;;H05K3/247;;H05K3/321;;H05K3/247;;H01B1/22;;H05K3/321;;H01R13/03;;H01H1/60;;H01R4/58;;H01B1/24,H01B1/22;;H01B1/24;;H01H1/60;;H01R4/58;;H01R13/03;;H05K3/24;;H05K3/32,252/514;;252/502;;252/503;;252/510;;252/511;;252/512;;252/513,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

On the end of each piston of the hydraulic cylinders is mounted a bar with one way chain connectors on each end. Two chains are used, one on each side of the cylinders the chains are kept in position by guide sprockets. The chains are connected to the power shaft assembly. When the cylinders are activated the pistons move out from the cylinders and connect the chains on the right of the cylinders. When the pistons are fully extended they activate electric switches that reverse the direction of there movement. When the pistons are fully retracted they again activate electric switchs and reverse there direction. This is accomplished by using electric solenoids to operate the hydraulic controls. One chain moves in a clockwise direction and the other chain moves in a counter clockwise direction.

   Methods of making acid and rennet-based cheeses include processing a previous lot of milk to produce curds and whey from the previous lot of milk, and removing the whey from the curd. For cottage cheeses, curds are washed with a wash water. Whey and wash water (when used) include fine particles of curd, which are collected, added, and mixed into a subsequent lot of milk preferably using a mixer such as a homogenizer or colloid mill. Mixing preferably reduces the fine particle size of at least a plurality of the fine particles and increases the total amount of surface area thereof. Fine particles are reincorporated into the matrix of the curd made from the subsequent lot of milk, which increases curd yield. Also provided is a higher yield cheese that is made from a subsequent lot of milk that includes fine particles of curd from a previous lot of milk.

For cottage cheeses, curds are washed with a wash water. Whey and wash water (when used) include fine particles of curd, which are collected, added, and mixed into a subsequent lot of milk preferably using a mixer such as a homogenizer or colloid mill. Mixing preferably reduces the fine particle size of at least a plurality of the fine particles and increases the total amount of surface area thereof. Fine particles are reincorporated into the matrix of the curd made from the subsequent lot of milk, which increases curd yield.

As shown in Fig. 1, the load is placed on plate 1 on a spider 2 constrained to vertical movement by arms 3, 4 attached by horizontal and vertical leaf-springs 6, 7 to the spider 2 and standard 5; a projection 8 supports a spring 9 anchored to arm 4 to oppose the downward thrust of the load; arc arm 24 on spider 2 is connected by a flexible strip 22 to one end of lever 17 pivoted by horizontal and vertical leaf springs 19, 20; lever 17 carries a slotted shutter 32, Fig. V, which can move between a light source 38 and photoelectric cell 40 to generate pulses. To make a weighing, switch 46, Fig. VI, is closed to start motor 43 which makes a holding circuit for itself over cam-operated contacts 51; cam 50 then closes contacts 52 to produce a zero-setting pulse for the electronic counter 42 and to energize relay 36 to release a catch 31, thus releasing the lever 17, Fig. I, and spider 2 from a position of disequilibrium; during the subsequent movement as spider 2 moves downwardly, the shutter 32 moves to generate pulses which are counted in the electronic counter 42; towards the end of one complete oscillation the cam 50 breaks contacts 52 to release relay 36 so that the catch 31 re-engages lever 17 at the bottom of its swing. In a modification, Fig. VIII (not shown), the spring 9 is arranged to act on the lever 17. In a further modification, Fig. VII, the spider 60 carries the shutter 73 on an arm 74 and is directly acted upon by the stop catch 67. In another modification, Fig. IX, the load is applied to the far end of member 100 against a spring 106 through a tape 110 wound round a shaft 104 carrying arms 113, 127; arm 113 carries a slotted shutter 114 for generating the pulses, and arm 127 carries a stop 128 released when cam 129 rotates clockwise and re-engaged when the cam has made one complete revolution which is timed to coincide with one complete oscillation of arm 127. Subsidiary cams driven from motor 137 make contacts for setting the electronic counter to zero and for stopping the motor 137 at the end of one rotation of cam 129. Adjustments. In Fig. I the anchorages of the spring 19 are adjustable along the arms 8, 4 to accommodate widely differing loads, and the equilibrium position of the spider 2 is adjustable by screw and nut 13 on the anchorage on arm 8. In Fig. IX the effective length of the spring 106 is variable by a collar 111 forming part of the support rod 107, and nuts 112 permit the equilibrium position to be adjusted.

   A system displays a collection of stationary images as a motion picture to passengers travelling in a vehicle along a pathway. The vehicle moves at a known speed and known distance from the images. The system includes an image illumination system including stroboscopic lighting for each image. The images, placed in parallel along the walls of the pathway of the vehicle, are adapted in number, size, and spacing for a vehicle travelling at the known speed and at the known distance from images on one or both sides of the vehicle such as to maintain an approximately constant viewing rate and perceived size of the images. The system includes mounting mechanisms for positioning each image vertically and at a constant distance from the train regardless of unevenness in wall contour. Glare due to interior lighting in the vehicle is reduced or eliminated by selecting the appropriate illumination intensity for the stroboscopic lighting.

The selection of the input and feed-back components, and hence the mode of operation of the time-base generator, is effected by an electronic switch 45 controlled by a gate pulse generator 34 synchronized by the transmitter trigger pulse generator 11, a further output from generator 34 being applied to brighten the trace on tube 15. The sin # and cos # scan control voltages are produced as described in Specification 679,723 by applying the output from an L.F. oscillator 17 to demodulators 18 and 19 through a magslip resolver 16 ganged to the aerial 13. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, push-pull magnetic deflection is employed, the output from amplifier 40 being applied to a current generator 22, Fig. 1, comprising a valve 50, Fig. 2, with a deflection coil 24 in its anode circuit, the feedback for amplifier 40 being derived from the cathode of valve 50 and a further output from said cathode being applied through a paraphase amplifier 26 and current generator (28, Fig. 1= 57, Fig. 2) to a deflection coil 30.

The reference wafer (10) contains sections (12) divided into subsections (16), each subsection having a quasi-random pattern of light scattering features on an otherwise polished surface of the wafer. The quasi-random pattern of features is formed by creating a random pattern of pits (20) within tiny areas (18) of the subsection and repeating that pattern. The random pattern of pits covers an area less than the area of the spot of a scanning beam used by the wafer surface inspection system. By randomizing the pattern of pits within the scanning beam, the scattered light does not produce interference patterns and thus the scattered light is more isotropic. A direct measurement of the amount of haze on the reference wafer can be obtained from measuring the amount of scattered light caused by the pits. Since this level of scattering is known beforehand to correspond to a certain level of haze, the wafer surface inspection system can then be calibrated to accurately measure haze on surfaces of non-reference wafers.",VLSI STANDARDS INC,MONTEVERDE ROBERT J;;SCHEER BRADLEY W,,https://lens.org/015-119-667-655-156,Patent Application,yes,5,4,2,2,0,G01N21/93;;G01N21/9501;;H01L22/34;;H01L22/34;;G01N21/93;;G01N21/9501,G01N21/93;;G01N21/95;;H01L23/544,G1A AA9           FB;;G1A AFB           FB;;G1A AG13          FB;;G1A AG7           FB;;G1A AR7           FB;;G1A AT27          FB;;G1A AT3           FB;;G1A AT4           FB,0,0,,,,PENDING

    An automated storage and retrieval system (ASRS) wherein individual identical articles are disposed in vertical stacks stored in cells of movable totes. The totes are movable into and out of storage racks by an automated storage/retrieval vehicle. The ASRS includes an order picking system having at least two zones disposed along an order-collecting conveyor system. One zone picks low-demand articles, and the other zone employs high-speed dispensers which support plural upright stacks each containing identical high-demand articles for dispensing of such articles onto the conveyor system. A controller assigns order-collecting areas along the conveyor system so that picked or dispensed articles within the zones are deposited into a preassigned area for assembly of an order. The pick zone for low-demand articles preferably includes several subzones arranged serially of the conveyor system, and each subzone includes a picker mechanism which includes a picking head which moves longitudinally and transversely of the conveyor. A plurality of totes are supported adjacent and longitudinally along at least one side of the conveyor system, with the cells in each tote typically defining plural stacks of different articles all having a preassigned position relative to the movement of the picking head. The controller causes the picking head to remove a desired article from a specific cell for transfer to the preassigned area of the conveyor system.

The first clamp (34) is extended above the work plane (124) established by the outer surface of one workpiece (10) with the lower ram retracted. Next, the frame (26) is moved downwardly until the first clamp touches the work­piece. An encoder (140) measures the amount of first clamp collapse during overtravel of the frame (26) after the first touch is sensed. The frame (26) is now backed off this distance to establish a work line coextensive with the work plane (124). The lower clamp (36) is then raised to clamp the workpieces (10,12) and a drill (88) carried by a sub-frame (66) will now drill aligned apertures through the workpieces (10,12). The sub-frame (66) is indexed to another position to place rams (96,86) in alignment with the apertures. The upper riveting ram (96) is then advanced to its full down position to set an upper cavity and is locked under high pressure. The lower ram (86) then rises under low pressure to a snug-up position. Squeeze forming is now accomplished by   simultaneously controlled motion of the frame down and the lower ram up until an upset complete signal is received. During this operation the upper clamp (34) is in a resilient condition. When the rivet (R) is completely upset, pressure is dumped from the upper clamp (34) and simultaneously the frame (26) is driven to its start position and the lower ram (86) is retracted. As soon as the lower ram (86) reaches its back away position, the upper riveting ram (96) is fully retracted.

   An active protection circuit for a MOSFET isolated switched power supply system operates to control the switching of the MOSFET isolation switches. A monitoring circuit operates to sense and turn off the isolation switch of the currently active power supply if it senses reverse current flowing through the switch. Simultaneously, a controller receives indication that the active power supply is out of specification, and actively switches the system voltage source to the other power supply. The controller actively ensures that the isolation switch of the out-of-specification power supply remains off until it determines otherwise.

In such a converter, according to the invention, the regulator controls the time periods of the current conducting capability of at least one pair of electronic switches which conduct current alternately in the primary circuit (energised in push-pull) of the transformer, while the time periods of current conducting capability of one electronic switch of the pair, or of each pair, of electronic switches overlap with the time periods of current conducting capability of the other electronic switch of the same pair. During operation, voltage stabilisation is achieved on the basis of the property that the time periods of the overlap increase as the voltage drop across the load decreases, and the time periods of the overlap reduce as the voltage drop across the load increases.

Various embodiments employ one or more preferred carpenter bee habitat features including an overhanging roof protecting the entrance hole from the weather, an entrance hole that slopes upward from horizontal, entrance holes surrounded by wood, and an opaque material forming the plenum regions such that the interior in the vicinity of the entrance holes is relatively dark. Various alternatives are possible for example to enhance trap performance in various situations or to make the traps aesthetically pleasing to a variety of tastes. In one embodiment, existing carpenter bee nests are treated with a disclosed insecticide gel. The insecticide gel consists of a thixotropic, injectable, non-hardening, non-volatile gel blended with a pyrethroid insecticide. A small amount of gel injected into existing nests kills all bees and larvae in the nests as well as any bees that enter the nest during the residual life of the application, in effect converting the bee nest into a trap.

    An active protection circuit for a MOSFET isolated switched power supply system operates to control the switching of the MOSFET isolation switches. A monitoring circuit operates to sense and turn off the isolation switch of the currently active power supply if it senses reverse current flowing through the switch. Simultaneously, a controller receives indication that the active power supply is out of specification, and actively switches the system voltage source to the other power supply. The controller actively ensures that the isolation switch of the out-of-specification power supply remains off until it determines otherwise.

    A power system has a first power supply operatively connect in parallel to a second power supply. The output of the first power supply is connected to the input of a switching device, such as a mosfet. The output of the switching device is the output of the power system. A measuring device, such as a differential amplifier measures the polarity between the input and output of the switching device. A controller connected to the switching device permits the switching device to conduct current if a first polarity is present between the input and the output. The controller interrupts current flow if a second polarity is present between the input and the output.

The first clamp (34) is extended above the work plane (124) established by the outer surface of one workpiece (10) with the lower ram retracted. Next, the frame (26) is moved downwardly until the first clamp touches the work­piece. An encoder (140) measures the amount of first clamp collapse during overtravel of the frame (26) after the first touch is sensed. The frame (26) is now backed off this distance to establish a work line coextensive with the work plane (124). The lower clamp (36) is then raised to clamp the workpieces (10,12) and a drill (88) carried by a sub-frame (66) will now drill aligned apertures through the workpieces (10,12). The sub-frame (66) is indexed to another position to place rams (96,86) in alignment with the apertures. The upper riveting ram (96) is then advanced to its full down position to set an upper cavity and is locked under high pressure. The lower ram (86) then rises under low pressure to a snug-up position. Squeeze forming is now accomplished by   simultaneously controlled motion of the frame down and the lower ram up until an upset complete signal is received. During this operation the upper clamp (34) is in a resilient condition. When the rivet (R) is completely upset, pressure is dumped from the upper clamp (34) and simultaneously the frame (26) is driven to its start position and the lower ram (86) is retracted. As soon as the lower ram (86) reaches its back away position, the upper riveting ram (96) is fully retracted.

The client stub and the client remote messaging engine prepare a server-ready object, referred to as a RemoteMethodObject ( 219 ) in response to client application logic ( 207 ) requesting a service from server ( 227 ) in the form of a call to the stub. The object is of a type corresponding to a particular service, and includes a header identifying its type and a user requesting the service. The object further includes data parameters for the service. The object's type, once received by the server, is identified, and a handle operation called. The method for the handle operation is bound to the object based on its type. SystemObject manager ( 221 ) manages objects that are instances of classes registered with it. The SystemObject manager pre-allocates memory, and subdivides the memory into elements called SystemObjects. Each RemoteMethodObject is mapped to a SystemObject when received. Other objects ( 223 ) can be created from SystemObjects. Each SystemObject includes basic information with which to manage usage of the memory element by an object.

A second fluid is disposed between the cooling surface and the adapter for conducting thermal energy from the adapter to the cooling surface whereby the cooling surface remains free to move axially relative to the adapter at a temperature of the cooling surface at which the first fluid is susceptible to freezing. This allows for movement of the cold finger relative to the dewar and adapter, due to differential thermal coefficients of expansion or support structure motion, without adversely affecting the communication of thermal energy from the load. In the illustrative embodiment, the cooler is a Stirling cycle cooler, the first fluid is thermal grease and the second fluid is nitrogen. The cooling surface is a cylindrical cold finger of the Stirling cycle cooler and the cooled surface is an inner wall of a dewar assembly. The dewar is in thermal contact with a load. The adapter is disposed between the inner wall of the dewar and the cold finger. The adapter has an end cap and a cylindrical housing extending therefrom. The housing extends at least partially along a longitudinal axis of the cold finger. An insulator is disposed about the cold finger and the adapter housing.

The first clamp (34) is extended above the work plane established by the outer surface of one workpiece (10) with the lower ram retracted. Next, the frame (26) is moved downwardly until the first clamp touches the workpiece. An encoder (140) measured the amount of first clamp collapse during overtravel of the frame after the first touch is sensed. The frame is now backed off this distance to establish a work line coextensive with the work plane. The lower clamp (36) is then raised to clamp the workpieces (10, 12) and drill carried by a sub-frame (66) will now drill aligned apertures through the workpieces. The subframe is indexed to another position to place rams (96, 86) is alignment with the apertures. The upper riveting ram (96) is then advanced to its full down position to set an upper cavity and is locked under high pressure. The lower ram (86) then rises under low pressure to a snug up position. Squeeze forming is now accomplished by simultaneously controlled motion of the frame down and the lower ram up until an upset complete signal is received. During this operation the upper clamp (34) is in a resilient condition. When the rivet is completely upset pressure is dumped from the upper clamp and simultaneously the frame is driven to its start position and the lower ram is retracted. As soon as the lower ram reaches its back away position the upper riveting ram is fully retracted.",GEN ELECTRO MECH CORP,ROBERTS BRADLEY M;;KELLNER ROBERT J,GEMCOR II LLC (2004-06-28);;GEMCOR ENGINEERING CORP. 785 HERTEL AVENUE BUFFALO NEW YORK 14207 A CORP.

A tubular sleeve element encompasses these opposing ends, and a potting compound positionally retains the opposing ends within the tubular sleeve. The hollow fiber lumens are fluid-connected to a reservoir containing a pressurized feed liquid, and the loops of hollow fiber are immersed in an essentially unpressurized extractant liquid. The pressure of the feed liquid is continually increased until there is an incipient presence of the feed liquid in the extractant liquid. The pressure of the feed liquid at that incipient presence may therefore be used to calculate a maximum pressure differential tolerated by the microporous hollow fibers for the feed and extractant liquids used. The system which detects the incipient presence may also be associated with full scale liquid-liquid extraction modules so that malfunctions and/or module failures may be determined.

A tubular sleeve element encompasses these opposing ends, and a potting compound positionally retains the opposing ends within the tubular sleeve. The hollow fiber lumens are fluid-connected to a reservoir containing a pressurized feed liquid, and the loops of hollow fiber are immersed in an essentially unpressurized extractant liquid. The pressure of the feed liquid is continually increased until there is an incipient presence of the feed liquid in the extractant liquid. The pressure of the feed liquid at that incipient presence may therefore be used to calculate a maximum pressure differential tolerated by the microporous hollow fibers for the feed and extractant liquids used. The system which detects the incipient presence may also be associated with full scale liquid-liquid extraction modules so that malfunctions and/or module failures may be determined.",HOECHST CELANESE CORP,CALLAHAN ROBERT W;;REED BRADLEY W,HOECHST CELANESE CORPORATION A CORP.

A first communication connection can then be established between the first network socket and the second network socket.",MOTOROLA INC,LOGALBO ROBERT D;;HIBEN BRADLEY M,MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS INC (2008-08-04),https://lens.org/002-947-593-627-890,Patent Application,yes,25,93,12,12,0,H04W8/06;;H04W80/04;;H04L12/189;;H04W8/186;;H04W84/08;;H04L12/1895;;H04W72/30;;H04W8/186;;H04W8/06;;H04W80/04;;H04W84/08;;H04L12/1895;;H04L12/189;;H04W72/30,H04L12/28,370/254,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The method includes a step of copying to a first buffer a portion of a display memory corresponding to a present portion of the second image wherein a first image will first appear. The method further includes the steps of superposing within the display memory the first image upon the present portion of the second image and copying to a second buffer the portion of the display memory corresponding to the present portion of the second image, including the first image superposed thereon, and a portion of the display memory corresponding to a next portion of the second image wherein the first image will next appear. The method further includes the steps of erasing the first image from the second buffer by copying the present portion from the first buffer to the second buffer and superposing, within the second buffer, the first image upon the next portion of the second image. The method includes a further step of copying the second buffer to the display memory such that the first image disappears from the present portion of the second image while simultaneously appearing within the next portion of the second image, thereby avoiding display screen flicker.
