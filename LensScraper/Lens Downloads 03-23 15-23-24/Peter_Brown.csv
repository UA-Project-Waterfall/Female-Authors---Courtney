The liquid confectionery material used may be chocolate. Since unaerated chocolate generally melts less easily than aerated chocolate providing the product with an outer coating reduces the risk of chocolate melting in someone's fingers. Several other advantages also result from the inventive process. Since aerated chocolate is generally paler than unaerated chocolate, the coating of relatively unaerated chocolate improves the colour of the item. Moreover, since aeration can improve taste in some cases, a product coated in accordance with the invention could have improved taste without a deterioration in appearance or handling/shelf life characteristics. Yet a further advantage of coating a product in accordance with the inventive process is that, since aerated chocolate is generally more viscous than unaerated chocolate, a thick coating of aerated chocolate could be applied at much lower cost than unaerated chocolate but at the same time achieving substantially the same consumer appeal as for a 'thick' chocolate coating.",APV LTD;;BROWN PETER,BROWN PETER,,https://lens.org/138-426-105-332-937,Patent Application,yes,9,14,3,3,0,A23G1/305;;A23G3/20;;A23G3/343;;A23G2220/02;;A23G2220/20,A23G1/00;;A23G1/30;;A23G3/20;;A23G3/34,,3,0,,,"PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN vol. 010, no. 219 (C - 363) 31 July 1986 (1986-07-31);;PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN vol. 1995, no. 02 31 March 1995 (1995-03-31);;PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN vol. 016, no. 025 (C - 0903) 22 January 1992 (1992-01-22)",PENDING

If an unusually high pressure is established at one side 26 of the piston, for example by unusually rapid closing movement of an associated door, the pressure can prevent the piston moving with the valve element 33 and the rod so that the passage 32 through the piston is opened to relieve the pressure. Alternatively (Fig. 3, not shown) the piston is connected directly to carrier 17, and piston rod 16 extends to a spring abutting nut at the opposite closer end, the nut being adjustable from outside the closer to adjust spring tension and thus the pressure at which valve 34 lifts.

DOWTY HYDRAULIC UNITS Ltd. Oct. 19, 1962 [Oct.30, 1961], No. 38760/61. Heading B7H. [Also in Division F2] In a motor vehicle transmission comprising a reversible positive displacement pump 1 driven by the vehicle engine and supplying positive displacement motors 2, 3 driving the front and rear wheels of the vehicle, a valve 4 is manually operable to restrict the supply to either the motor 2 or the motor 3 if wheel spin at the front or rear wheels occurs or to cut off the supply to the rear motor 3 entirely to increase the driving ratio. Reversible feed and return lines from the pump 1 are connected to ports 16, 17 each communicating with two ports 21, 22 and 23, 24 connected to reversible feed and return lines 26, 27 and 28, 29 to the motors 2, 3. Axial displacement of a valve spool 7 by means of a lever 32 restricts the ports connected to both the feed and return lines to one motor but non- return valves 34, 35, 36, 37 ensure that only the feed line is restricted. When the supply to the rear motor 3 is cut off entirely a port 25 connected to a branch 31 from the line 28 communicates with the port 24 to ensure that fluid may circulate freely through the motor 3. A pump 38 supplies make-up fluid to the return line 16 or 17 through a non-return valve 39 or 41 and also supplies cooling fluid to the casings of the motors 2, 3 through a restrictor 44. A non-return valve 48 supplies make-up fluid to the rear motor 3 when it is isolated.",DOWTY HYDRAULIC UNITS LTD,BROWN PETER HENRY,,https://lens.org/003-508-252-420-041,Granted Patent,no,0,3,1,1,0,B60K17/10;;F16H61/4165;;F16H61/40,B60K17/10;;F16H61/40;;F16H61/4165,B7H HC4A2C        -;;B7H HV4U          -;;B7H HXC           HXC;;B7H H103          HXC;;B7H H211          HXC;;F2D DB040         D(AQ;;F2D DB134         D(AQ;;F2D DB135         D(AQ;;F2D DB136         D(AQ;;F2D DB137         D(AQ;;F2D DB150         D(AQ;;F2D DB152         D(AQ;;F2D DB154         D(AQ;;F2D DB158         D(AQ;;F2W WC3           WC3;;F2W W042          WC3;;F2W W132          WC3;;F2W W152          WC3;;F2W W176          WC3;;F2W W182          WC3;;F2W W196          WC3;;F2W W222          WC3;;F2W W228          WC3;;F2W W230          WC3;;F2W W268          WC3;;F2W W272          WC3;;F2W W318          WC3;;F2W W322          WC3;;F2W W324          WC3;;F2W W446          WC3,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

DOWTY HYDRAULIC UNITS Ltd., and UNIPAT A. G. Feb. 22, 1957 [Feb. 27, 1956], No. 6042/56. Class 102(1). [Also in Group XXIX] In a swash plate pump a rotary cylinder block 29 and swash plate 4 are coupled together by means of a constant velocity universal joint 12 ; the relative angular position between the block and plate is set after assembly of the pump to ensure that the piston rods 41 oscillate in planes which pass through the axis of rotation. One half of the joint 12 is secured to the block 29 and the other half is carried by a shaft 9 having a reduced portion 13 to allow slight flexing, a serrated portion 14 and a portion 16 threaded at the end to receive a nut 21 accessible from the exterior of the pump. After assembly the block 29 and plate 4 are aligned and the nut 21 is then tightened causing the serrated portion 14 to bite into a soft ring 15 thereby locking the shaft 9 to the swash plate 4. The block 29 is held against a ported valve face by means of a spring 53 and fluid pressure in a chamber 46 connected through valves 51, 52 to the inlet/outlet ports 31, 32. The cylinder assembly is pivoted in bearings 24, 25, 35, 36 for stroke varying.

   A method and system for simulating, modeling and scheduling equipment preparation procedures in the biopharmaceutical production process is described herein. The use of process vessels in batch process manufacturing is optimized through the use of peak load scheduling frames. The system and method includes the steps of identifying soiled process components and their associated equipment preparation procedures. After the soiled process components are identified, a master list of soiled process components and their associated equipment preparation procedures is generated. After the soiled process components and the equipment preparation procedures are identified, the equipment preparation procedures are scheduled out based on preparation equipment protocols to generate a equipment preparation load summary table. Next, the size and capacity of the preparation equipment is determined based on the information in the load summary table. After the size and capacity of the preparation equipment is determined, an equipment preparation time line is generated.

The speech processing circuitry establishes overlapping time durations for generating the acoustic parameters and further employs a sinc-Kaiser smoothing function in combination with a folding technique for providing a discrete Fourier transform.

When the brakes are released the mechanism is returned to the position shown in Fig. 1 by means of a return spring (not shown) connected between an anchorage and a lug 21 on the lever 10.",GIRLING LTD,BROWN PETER WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/160-127-831-951-449,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B60T11/08,B60T11/08;;F16D65/22,F2E EP            EPZ;;F2E E3B           -;;F2E E3G           -;;F2E E3H           -;;F2E E3K           EPZ;;F2K K4B4          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The main element of the propulsion system is an elongated hollow tube that is open at one end and closed at the other end. Inside near the closed end there is a jet engine, a heater for raising the temperature of a gas, a gaseous substance, a gas compressor and a means of generating a directional force. The said force is directed towards the closed end of the tube. The means adapted to provide the said force may be electrostatic force, or it may be centrifugal force generated by spinning the whole unit. The said force causes the gas to collect at the closed end of the tube. The gas is first compressed and then heated to a high temperature in a container. Then the hot high-pressure gas is introduced to the jet engine, which directs the exhaust gas towards the open end of the tube. Two extra forces result, the main one being the push from the jet engine. The other force derives from the cooling gases circulating down the walls of the tube to the closed end of the tube, where a change in the direction of momentum causes an additional force. both extra forces are directed towards the closed end of the tube. There are no opposing forces because the other end of the tube is open to space.",HORSLEY PETER B,HORSLEY PETER BROWN,,https://lens.org/076-735-528-350-944,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,B64G1/409,B64G1/40,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

    A latch mechanism is provided for a door which includes a rotatable latch which is rotated into and held in an open position to allow the door to open, and is released from the open position only when a sensing mechanism provided as a part of the latch mechanism, held in the door, senses the door frame upon a closing of the door. The latch is held in an over center engaged position which it is moved into due to a lost motion connection among some, but not all, elements of the latch mechanism.

   In an effort to achieve the lowest cost of goods (COG) possible, a key objective in batch manufacturing is to maximize equipment utilization so that the capacity and size of equipment per batch cycle is the smallest possible for a given batch production capacity. This optimization of equipment utilization minimizes equipment and direct utility costs per batch, as well as reduces the physical space and the associated utilities required to support manufacturing operations. The present invention provides a means of: (1) determining the optimal number of batch cycles per year for a required annual production capacity; and (2) determining the optimal number of equipment cycle iterations per batch cycle in a manner that: (a) creates the smallest batch sizes possible; and (b) achieves higher equipment utilization per batch cycle, thereby reducing the capacity and size of equipment required to produce a given batch quantity of product.

In the current invention only one focussed image is used. The three-dimensional effect is achieved by recording the various focal lengths of rays from the original picture elements after the rays have passed through the optical lens of the camera. Within an evacuated tube, a thin pho to- sensitive dielectric plate is mechanically reciprocated through the range of focal depths in the image on which the focussed illuminated picture elements generate electric charges which are then sequentially scanned and recorded electronically. At the television receiving set, a dielectric plate coated with fine fluorescent elements adapted to fluoresce in the primary colors is mechanically reciprocated in synchronization with t he sequence of picture elements transmitted electronically from the camera. The range of focal depths in the image is then expanded to recreate the original three-dimensional sce ne by a picture tube fitted with an optical lens or fresnel lens.",HORSLEY PETER B,HORSLEY PETER BROWN,,https://lens.org/194-215-948-006-807,Patent Application,no,0,2,1,1,0,H04N13/221;;H04N13/211;;H04N13/395,H04N13/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

In a method of mounting a bridge structure a bridge beam 11 is supported upon an abutment 12 by first placing a precast concrete beam 14 carrying a superposed bearing 13 of the kind described in the parent Specification within a recess formed, e.g. during casting, in the abutment 12, aligning the precast beam 14, e.g. by wedges and packs, into its correct position, mounting the bridge beam 11 upon the bearing 13, and finally grouting in the beam completely filling the recess in the abutment 12. The bearing 13 may be secured, e.g. by gluing or bonding, or fitted by corresponding projections and recesses, to the beam 14 before the latter is placed in the recess in the abutment 12. A slot 15 in the upper face of the bearing 13 receives a corresponding rib on the underface of the bridge beam 11, alternatively the rib may be formed on the bearing 13 and the corresponding slot in the underface of the bridge beam. In another arrangement a curved bearing 13 is located between correspondingly curved opposed faces of the beams 11, 14. In a modification, Fig. 3, the bearing 13 carries a dowel pin 18 the upper and lower portions of which extend respectively into the beams 11, 14. In a further modification, Fig. 4 (not shown), the dowel pin is attached, e.g. by welding, to the upper bearing-supporting face of a steel girder of T cross-sectional shape which is. accommodated in the recess in the abutment 12. In another arrangement, Fig. 6 (not shown), the bearing 13 has a mild steel bar welded along the central longitudinal axis of the upper face of the T-section girder, the corresponding raised rib-like portion on the central part of the bearing being received in a corresponding groove in the lower surface of the beam 11. Fig. 8 shows a T-section beam levelled by means of blocks 26 and having its web depending into a recess 27 in the abutment 12. The T-section beam may be replaced by one of I-section.

   In a method of operating an inkjet printer, an intermediate transfer member is movable in an advance direction. A carrier supports a printhead, and is movable relative to the intermediate transfer member in a direction generally perpendicular to the advance direction. The printhead defines a plurality of raster lines extending over the intermediate transfer member at a non-perpendicular, fixed angle vector relative to the advanced direction. A bitmap image is defined which corresponds to an image to be formed on the intermediate transfer member. The bitmap image includes a plurality of rows and columns of pixels, with at least one image data corresponding to each pixel. The bitmap image is skewed such that the image data for at least one column within the bitmap image is shifted a predetermined number of pixel locations, dependent upon the fixed angle vector.

April 16, 1964 [May 2, 1963], No. 4365/63. Heading F2E. In a disc brake of the kind in which friction pads for engagement with opposite faces of a brake disc rotatable with the wheel are mounted in a non-rotatable caliper which straddles a portion of the periphery of the disc, the caliper being mounted to swing about an axis substantially at right angles to the axis of the brake disc, the friction pad on one side of the disc is located radially inwards from the pad on the other side and one pad is applied to an adjacent face of the disc by actuating means associated with the caliper, the other friction pad being applied to the other face of the disc by the reaction on the caliper. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 2, the brake disc is constructed as a ring 41 extending radially inwards from an axially extending flange which is secured by bolts 42 to a pressing 43 mounted on the hub of a wheel and this assembly is housed within the rim 44 of the wheel which is carried by a dished disc 45. The inner periphery of the ring 41 is straddled by a floating caliper 46 which is mounted-to swing about a stationary pivot 55. A friction pad 47 is adapted to engage the inboard face of the ring and is carried by a rigid backing plate 48 guided on pins 49 and urged into engagement with the disc by a piston rod 51 of a piston working in an hydraulic cylinder in the inboard limb of the caliper. A second friction pad 52 is mounted on a backing plate 53 and guided on members 55 to be located in the caliper on the outboard side of the ring and is urged into engagement with the outboard face of the ring by the reaction on the caliper when the hydraulic cylinder is pressurized. The friction pads 47, 52 are both tapered in a radial direction and the inner edge of the ring 41 is chamfered at 54 at such an angle that the clearance between this edge and the caliper does not vary appreciably as the friction pads wear and the angular position of the caliper changes.",GIRLING LTD,BROWN PETER WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/034-076-442-172-112,Granted Patent,no,0,3,4,4,0,F16D55/228;;F16D55/2255,F16D55/2255;;F16D55/228,F2E EEH           ED16;;F2E EEH           EEH;;F2E EHB           EHB/;;F2E E1A1B         -;;F2E E1A1C         -;;F2E E1A1D2        -;;F2E E2N1A1        -;;F2E E2N1A11A      -;;F2E E2N1A4A2      -;;F2E E2N1A5        -;;F2E E2N1C2A       -;;F2E E2N1D16       -;;F2E E2N1D2B       -;;F2E E2N1D2C       -;;F2E E2N1D6A       -;;F2E E2N1D6C1      -;;F2E E2N1D6C5      -;;F2E E2N2B4        -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The method includes the step of selecting a sequence of unit operations wherein each of the sequence of unit operations has an identifier code. Next, a set of scheduling cycles is selected for each of the sequence of unit operations. A master table is then referenced, using the identifier code, to obtain operational parameters for each of the sequence of unit operations. A block flow diagram is then generated using the sequence of unit operations and the operational parameters. The method further includes generating a process time line using the operational parameters, the block flow diagram, and the set of scheduling cycles for each of the sequence of unit operations. The process time linea time line for the beginning and ending times of each unit operation and its associated tasks for the entire biopharmaceutical drug production processis used as a tool for batch processing and facility design.

   An apparatus and method for in-situ milling includes a support and a pair of spaced apart rails attached to the support. The support and rails are mounted between a pair of opposed mill housing wear plate surfaces. A milling assembly is reversibly mounted on the rails in either of a first orientation and a second orientation. In the first orientation, the milling assembly mills one of the wear plate surfaces. The milling assembly is reverse mounted on the rails to the second orientation for milling the other of the wear plate surfaces. This permits the support and the rails to remain in one position between the wear plate surfaces requiring only the milling assembly to be moved to accomplish milling of each of the wear plate surfaces.

    An apparatus and method for in-situ milling includes a support and a pair of spaced apart rails attached to the support. The support and rails are mounted between a pair of opposed mill housing wear plate surfaces. A milling assembly is reversibly mounted on the rails in either of a first orientation and a second orientation. In the first orientation, the milling assembly mills one of the wear plate surfaces. The milling assembly is reverse mounted on the rails to the second orientation for milling the other of the wear plate surfaces. This permits the support and the rails to remain in one position between the wear plate surfaces requiring only the milling assembly to be moved to accomplish milling of each of the wear plate surfaces.

   An apparatus and method for in-situ milling includes a support and a pair of spaced apart rails attached to the support. The support and rails are mounted between a pair of opposed mill housing wear plate surfaces. A milling assembly is reversibly mounted on the rails in either of a first orientation and a second orientation. In the first orientation, the milling assembly mills one of the wear plate surfaces. The milling assembly is reverse mounted on the rails to the second orientation for milling the other of the wear plate surfaces. This permits the support and the rails to remain in one position between the wear plate surfaces requiring only the milling assembly to be moved to accomplish milling of each of the wear plate surfaces.

Reactor fouling with by-product polyethylene can be severe at operating temperatures of greater than 60° C. However, the activation of such catalysts in a continuous flow reactor at low temperatures can be difficult and activity can be low. We have now discovered that highly active Cr/P—N—P catalysts may be prepared and activated in-situ (i.e. directly in the polymerization reactor) at low temperatures (from about 30 to about 45° C.) by combining the Cr; the P—N—P ligand and an aluminoxane in the process solvent in the presence of hydrogen. The use of hydrogen allows very high productivity (greater than 1×10 6 grams of ethylene conversion per gram of Cr) at low temperature. We have also observed reactor fouling rates as low as 2 to 10 parts per million of polyethylene per hour (based on total ethylene conversion) using this process.",NOVA CHEM INT SA,ZORICAK PETER;;BROWN STEPHEN,NOVA CHEMICALS (INTERNATIONAL) S.A (2013-12-18),https://lens.org/071-187-388-971-426,Granted Patent,yes,16,0,10,10,0,B01J31/143;;C07C2/32;;C07C2/36;;B01J2231/20;;B01J2531/62;;C07C2531/14;;C07C2531/18;;C07C2531/22;;C07C2531/24;;B01J2540/22;;B01J31/188;;B01J31/143;;C07C2/32;;C07C2/36;;B01J2231/20;;B01J2531/62;;C07C2531/14;;C07C2531/18;;C07C2531/22;;C07C2531/24;;B01J2540/22;;B01J31/188,C07C2/32;;B01J31/14;;B01J31/18;;C07C2/36;;C07C11/02,,1,1,108-639-302-635-479,12123014;;10.1039/b201335e,"Carter, Anthea; Cohen, Steven A.; Cooley, Neil A.; Murphy, Aden; Scutt, James and Wass, Duncan F.; High activity ethylene trimerisation catalysts based on diphosphine ligands; Copyright the Royal Society of Chemistry 2002, Received (in Cambridge, UK) Feb. 8, 2002, Accepted Mar. 11, 2002.

In a system in which current is collected by a sliding contact 14 from an A.C. line 13 and supplied to at least one D.C. or A.C. motor 15 via an automatic voltage regulator 16, a switching circuit is provided responsive to loss of contact of the collector. The voltage control comprises unspecified thyristor circuits 16 and the switching circuit has transistors 24 28 and Zener diode 26 arranged so that a voltage on line 32 disappears when the output of a transformer 17 is zero, and this suppresses the thyrister triggering pulses. A delay 31 prevents suppresion at zero points in the A.C. waveform. When contact is restored the triggering pulses are released and advanced to restore normal operation. A tap-changing transformer 10 provides coarse control and the system is normally operated to maintain constant tractive effort. The switching circuit may also operate an indicator.",ENGLISH ELECTRIC CO LTD,BROWN MICHAEL;;DUERDEN PETER,,https://lens.org/112-907-680-080-944,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,B60L3/003;;B60L9/08;;B60L9/24;;B60L2200/26;;H02H3/12;;Y02T10/64,B60L3/00;;B60L3/04;;H02H3/12,H2J JCA           JCA;;H2J JCD           JCD;;H2J JLX           JLX;;H2J J1D1          -;;H2J J1D2          -;;H2J J1U           -;;H2J J1X           -;;H2J J12D          -;;H2J J12F          -;;H2J J12NX         J1U;;H2J J12NX         J2G6;;H2J J12N1         J2G6;;H2J J12N3A        J1U;;H2J J12N3B        J1U;;H2J J12N3B        J2G6;;H2J J12N3Y        J1U;;H2J J12N3Y        J2G6;;H2J J2GX          -;;H2J J2G6B         J2G6;;H2J J2G6CY        J2G6;;H2J J2G6C1        J2G6;;H2J J2J3          J2G6,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The shell 11 is formed by spray- mixing chopped glass fibre strands with wet gypsum slurry against a moulding surface of appropriate shape and contour and allowing the mixture to set. The polystyrene block 12 is pre-foamed, allowed to set, and cut approximately to length and shape before being offered up to the back surface of the shell 11 and rolled and pressed against it to key and bond to the shell which is suitably supported during this process. The result is a coving which is relatively light in weight and has a class 0 fire resistance whilst giving every appearance of traditional sculptured solid hair- reinforced plaster coving. <IMAGE>",STONEFACE LIMITED,BROWN GRAHAME PETER WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/139-076-889-431-616,Patent Application,no,5,2,3,3,0,B32B13/14;;E04B9/005;;E04F19/0436;;B32B2317/16;;B32B5/18;;B32B5/16;;B32B2325/00;;B32B7/12;;B32B2419/06;;B32B29/002;;B32B13/12;;B32B21/02;;B32B2317/127;;B32B27/302,B32B13/14;;E04B9/00;;E04F19/04,B5N N0110         1;;B5N N0516         1;;B5N N0518         1;;B5N N0522         1;;B5N N0524         1;;B5P P172;;B5P P173;;B5P P182;;B5P P186;;B5P P187;;B5P P195;;B5P P196;;B5P P207;;B5P P207;;B5P P21Y;;B5P P223;;B5P P255;;B5P P259;;B5P P263;;B5P P401;;B5P P401;;B5P P408;;B5P P408;;B5P P409;;B5P P409;;B5P P453;;B5P P453;;B5P P46X;;B5P P46X;;B5P P499;;B5P P499;;B5P P50X;;B5P P50X;;B5P P500;;B5P P500;;B5P P515;;B5P P515;;B5P P517;;B5P P517;;B5P P519;;B5P P519;;B5P P534;;B5P P534;;B5P P536;;B5P P536;;B5P P537;;B5P P537;;B5P P567;;B5P P567;;B5P P59Y;;B5P P59Y;;B5P P606;;B5P P606;;B5P P617;;B5P P617;;B5P P618;;B5P P618;;B5P P619;;B5P P619;;B5P P625;;B5P P625;;B5P P626;;B5P P626;;B5P P627;;B5P P627;;B5P P628;;B5P P628;;B5P P648;;B5P P648;;B5P P650;;B5P P650;;B5P P658;;B5P P658;;B5P P681;;B5P P681;;B5P P684;;B5P P684;;B5P P76X;;B5P P76X,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Reactor fouling with by-product polyethylene can be severe at operating temperatures of greater than 60°C. However, the activation of such catalysts in a continuous flow reactor at low temperatures can be difficult and activity can be low. We have now discovered that highly active Cr/P-N-P catalysts may be prepared and activated in-situ (i.e. directly in the polymerization reactor) at low temperatures (from about 30 to about 45°C) by combining the Cr; the P-N-P ligand and an aluminoxane in the process solvent in the presence of hydrogen. The use of hydrogen allows very high productivity (greater than 1 x 10 6 grams of ethylene conversion per gram of Cr) at low temperature. We have also observed reactor fouling rates as low as 2 to 10 parts per million of polyethylene per hour (based on total ethylene conversion) using this process.",NOVA CHEM INT SA,ZORICAK PETER;;BROWN STEPHEN,,https://lens.org/144-470-895-838-400,Patent Application,yes,17,20,10,10,0,B01J31/143;;C07C2/32;;C07C2/36;;B01J2231/20;;B01J2531/62;;C07C2531/14;;C07C2531/18;;C07C2531/22;;C07C2531/24;;B01J2540/22;;B01J31/188;;B01J31/143;;C07C2/32;;C07C2/36;;B01J2231/20;;B01J2531/62;;C07C2531/14;;C07C2531/18;;C07C2531/22;;C07C2531/24;;B01J2540/22;;B01J31/188,B01J31/14;;B01J31/18;;C07C2/32;;C07C2/36;;C07C11/02,,2,2,108-639-302-635-479;;108-639-302-635-479,12123014;;10.1039/b201335e;;12123014;;10.1039/b201335e,"CARTER A ET AL: ""High activity ethylene trimerisation catalysts based on diphosphine ligands"", CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS > CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS - CHEMCOM; [6015D], ROYAL SOCIETY OF CHEMISTRY, GB, vol. 2002, no. 8, 20 March 2002 (2002-03-20), pages 858 - 859, XP002277009, ISSN: 1359-7345, DOI: 10.1039/B201335E;;CARTER ET AL., CHEM.

Reactor fouling with by-product polyethylene can be severe at operating temperatures of greater than 60° C. However, the activation of such catalysts in a continuous flow reactor at low temperatures can be difficult and activity can be low. We have now discovered that highly active Cr/P—N—P catalysts may be prepared and activated in-situ (i.e. directly in the polymerization reactor) at low temperatures (from about 30 to about 45° C.) by combining the Cr; the P—N—P ligand and an aluminoxane in the process solvent in the presence of hydrogen. The use of hydrogen allows very high productivity (greater than 1×10 6 grams of ethylene conversion per gram of Cr) at low temperature. We have also observed reactor fouling rates as low as 2 to 10 parts per million of polyethylene per hour (based on total ethylene conversion) using this process.",NOVA CHEMICALS (INTERNATIONAL) S A,ZORICAK PETER;;BROWN STEPHEN,NOVA CHEMICALS (INTERNATIONAL) S.A (2013-12-18),https://lens.org/110-459-448-059-308,Patent Application,yes,4,8,10,10,0,B01J31/143;;C07C2/32;;C07C2/36;;B01J2231/20;;B01J2531/62;;C07C2531/14;;C07C2531/18;;C07C2531/22;;C07C2531/24;;B01J2540/22;;B01J31/188;;B01J31/143;;C07C2/32;;C07C2/36;;B01J2231/20;;B01J2531/62;;C07C2531/14;;C07C2531/18;;C07C2531/22;;C07C2531/24;;B01J2540/22;;B01J31/188,B01J31/18;;B01J31/14;;C07C2/32,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Reactor fouling with by-product polyethylene can be severe at operating temperatures of greater than 60 DEG C. However, the activation of such catalysts in a continuous flow reactor at low temperatures can be difficult and activity can be low. We have now discovered that highly active Cr/P-N-P catalysts may be prepared and activated in-situ (i.e. directly in the polymerization reactor) at low temperatures (from about 30 to about 45 DEG C) by combining the Cr; the P-N-P ligand and an aluminoxane in the process solvent in the presence of hydrogen. The use of hydrogen allows very high productivity (greater than 1 x 106 grams of ethylene conversion per gram of Cr) at low temperature. We have also observed reactor fouling rates as low as 2 to 10 parts per million of polyethylene per hour (based on total ethylene conversion) using this process.",NOVA CHEMICAL INT SA,ZORICAK PETER;;BROWN STEPHEN,,https://lens.org/051-767-252-182-845,Patent Application,no,3,0,10,10,0,B01J31/143;;C07C2/32;;C07C2/36;;B01J2231/20;;B01J2531/62;;C07C2531/14;;C07C2531/18;;C07C2531/22;;C07C2531/24;;B01J2540/22;;B01J31/188;;B01J31/143;;C07C2/32;;C07C2/36;;B01J2231/20;;B01J2531/62;;C07C2531/14;;C07C2531/18;;C07C2531/22;;C07C2531/24;;B01J2540/22;;B01J31/188,B01J31/14;;B01J31/18;;C07C2/32;;C07C2/36;;C07C11/02,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The film (10b) comprises 30 micron thick PVDC. The field responsive layer (20) comprises electrically conductive matter in the form of vacuum deposited aluminium of about 5 Angstrom unit thickness. The heat-activatable adhesive layer (3b) comprises a hot seal glue of about 15 Angstrom unit thickness. The term 'field responsive matter' applies to matter which, when subjected to a suitable field of radio-frequency, electromagnetic or microwave radiation, will become heated to a sufficient level to cause the adhesive (3b) to melt and then set or cure. The sheet (3b) is used in the apparatus (1b), wherein heat-activation takes place by the use of radio-frequency high voltage heating means (25, 26). The sheet (2b) is folded and then passed through a roller nip (6). The means (25, 26) cause induction heating of the contiguous edges of the field responsive layer (20), due to the presence of a radio-frequency field (29). The heated layer (20) transmits heat to activate the glue layer (3b) whereby, when pressure is applied by co-operating rollers (4, 5) the longitudinal edges of the sheet (2b) are joined together to provide a good, substantially tamper-proof seal.",APV CORP LTD,SMITH PETER JAMES;;BROWN PETER ARTHUR,,https://lens.org/003-112-403-236-057,Patent Application,yes,7,6,5,5,0,B29C65/48;;B29C65/04;;B29C65/14;;B29C65/1425;;B29C65/36;;B29C65/3656;;B29C65/4815;;B29C65/4835;;B29C66/1122;;B29C66/45;;B29C66/71;;B29C66/723;;B29C66/72321;;B29C66/7234;;B29C66/83413;;B29C66/849;;B29K2027/08;;B65B11/50;;B65B51/22;;B65D75/26,B29C65/00;;B29C65/04;;B29C65/14;;B29C65/36;;B29C65/48;;B65B11/50;;B65B51/22;;B65D75/26,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Reactor fouling with by-product polyethylene can be severe at operating temperatures of greater than 60°C. However, the activation of such catalysts in a continuous flow reactor at low temperatures can be difficult and activity can be low. We have now discovered that highly active Cr/P-N-P catalysts may be prepared and activated in-situ (i.e. directly in the polymerization reactor) at low temperatures (from about 30 to about 45°C) by combining the Cr; the P-N-P ligand and an aluminoxane in the process solvent in the presence of hydrogen. The use of hydrogen allows very high productivity (greater than 1 x 10 6 grams of ethylene conversion per gram of Cr) at low temperature.

ELECTRIC & MUSICAL INDUSTRIES Ltd. 4 May, 1966 [4 May, 1965], No. 18619/65. Heading G5R. A magnetic recording tape 3 is driven by capstans 1 2 which are rotated in opposite directions by an endless elastic belt 9 actuated by a motor 17 having a reversible drive. Belt 9 is tensioned by means of an endless belt 15 and pulleys 14, 16 in such a manner that when tape 3 is driven from left to right the tension in the loop of belt 9 round pulley 10 which drives capstan 1 is greater than that in the loop round pulley 11 which drives capstan 2. Conversely when tape 3 is driven from right to left capstan 2 rotates faster than capstan 1. This arrangement augments the tension in the tape loop between the capstans in both directions of tape motion and stabilises the drive of the tape. In a modification shown in Fig. 3, the capstans are driven by an endless elastic belt 9 formed of two layers 9<SP>1</SP>, 9<SP>11</SP>, layer 9<SP>11</SP> being of higher elastic modulus than layer 9<SP>1</SP>. Belt 9 is placed round pulleys 10, 11, 12 as shown, with layer 9<SP>1</SP> adjacent the lower face of driving pulley 12 and layer 9<SP>11</SP> adjacent the upper face of pulley 12.

Tufting machines. KEYSTONE Ltd. 4 June, 1968 [8 June, 1967], No. 26575/67. Heading DIG. A tufting machine comprises a number of side-by-side rows of tufting needles arranged transversely to the backing material feed direction, reciprocable means for driving each needle towards the backing, and means energisable by selector mechanism in accordance with the pattern requirement for moving each needle from an inoperative position in disengagement with the driving means to an operative position in engagement with the driving means. In Fig. 4 a vertically-reciprocable frame 17 carries a number of spaced-apart E-shaped structures 22 each having an upper arm 23 formed with slots 26 extending upwards to closed ends 42, a middle arm 24 formed with slots 28, and a lower arm 25 formed with slots 32. The partitions 33 between the latter are formed with slots 34 extending downwardly to closed ends 34a. A needle 35, which may be eyed, hooked or tubular, is disposed in aligned slots 28, 32 and has opposed trunnions 37 disposed in adjacent slots 34. A rod 39, rigid with the armature of a solenoid carried by structure 22, passes through the latter and has a looped end 38 embracing needle 35. Energisation of the solenoid to shift rod 39 rightwards tilts needle 35 about trunnions 37 on ends 34a to disengage the upper end 43 of needle 35 from an aligned slot 26. Structure 22 thereby moves downwards relative to needle 35 until a collar 41 on the latter engages the curved undersurface 30 of arm 24, whereby needle 35 does not penetrate the backing 13 sufficiently to co-operate with a looper 46. Energisation of the solenoid to shift rod 39 leftwards tilts needle 35 to engage end 43 with slot 26, whereby ends 42, 43 co-act to drive needle 35 fully through backing 13 for co-operation with looper 46. The needles in each row carry yarn of the same colour and are connected to a photocell responsive to light of that colour when reflected thereon from a rotary and longitudinally-moving pattern drum. In Fig. 8 the needle has an inclined, upper end 44 adapted to co-act with the similarly inclined closed end 45 of slot 26. The needle is also formed, adjacent end 44, with a notch 47 adapted, in the inoperative position of the needle, to engage a lower flange 48 on a fixed plate 49, whereby the inoperative needle is restrained from movement. In this arrangement structure 22 may, alternatively, be stationary and plate 49 may be reciprocated vertically to drive the needles engaged therewith. In Fig. 10 a vertically-reciprocable beam 51 is disposed adjacent a fixed beam 61 and has a foot portion 62 projecting towards the latter. Foot 62 is formed with vertical slots, the partitions 63 between which are formed in their upper edges with notches 64 pivotally supporting opposed lugs 66 on needles 65 disposed in said slots. The upper end of each needle 66 is formed with opposed projections 67, 68 respectively disposed, in the uppermost position of beam 51, opposite recesses 69, 70 formed in beams 51 and 61 respectively. A spring 78, fixed at 79 to beam 61, engages the lower end of needle 65 to bias the upper end of the latter towards beam 61 and into engagement with a pin 75 carried at one end of a lever 71 which is pivoted intermediately at 72 to beam 61 and is connected at its other end to the armature 76 of a solenoid 77. Energisation of the latter thereby biases projection 67 into recess 69 for coupling the needle to beam 51. On de-energisation of solenoid 77, spring 78 biases projection 68 into recess 70 for uncoupling the needle.",KEYSTONE LTD,BROWN PHILIP;;JAMES PETER HENRY,,https://lens.org/006-393-012-253-952,Granted Patent,no,0,2,9,9,0,D05C15/20;;D05C15/20,D05C15/20,D1G GTH           GTH;;D1G G1F6          -;;D1G G1F7B         -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A battery to be tested 1 is connected across terminals X and Y and upon closure of switch 11 the capacitor 7 is charged up to the predetermined voltage in excess of the open circuit voltage of the battery 1. A timing pulse from a timer 13 passes through an open gate 14 to cause a switch 12 to go short circuit thereby shorting the capacitor 7 through the battery 1. Discharge of current flow through the battery 1 is monitored by a sample and hold unit 4 detecting the voltage across resistor 5. An alarm means 34 can be provided which is responsive to a comparison between the sensed discharge current and a predetermined threshold current level. A further sample and hold unit 16 senses a voltage difference between the discharge voltage across the battery 1 and the open circuit voltage of the battery 1. A divide 19 divides the voltage difference by sensed discharge current to produce a value proportional to internal resistance of the battery 1 which can be displayed on a meter 21.

Reactor fouling with by-product polyethylene can be severe at operating temperatures of greater than 60°C. However, the activation of such catalysts in a continuous flow reactor at low temperatures can be difficult and activity can be low. We have now discovered that highly active Cr/P-N-P catalysts may be prepared and activated in-situ (i.e. directly in the polymerization reactor) at low temperatures (from about 30 to about 45°C) by combining the Cr; the P-N-P ligand and an aluminoxane in the process solvent in the presence of hydrogen. The use of hydrogen allows very high productivity (greater than 1 x 10 6 grams of ethylene conversion per gram of Cr) at low temperature.

Electrolytic production of borates. UNITED STATES BORAX & CHEMICAL CORPORATION. June 30, 1961 [July 28, 1960], No. 26378/60. Class 41. A process for increasing the B 2 O 3 content of alkali metal or substituted or unsubstituted ammonium borates comprises electrolysing an aqueous solution of the borate in a cell provided with a cationic permselective membrane so that the alkali metal or ammonium ions are selectively removed from the solution and stopping the electrolysis before the ratio X 2 O: B 2 O 3 in the solution exceeds 1: 5 (X being an alkali metal atom or substituted or unsubstituted ammonium group). The progress of the electrolysis can be followed by measuring the pH and can be stopped, e.g. automatically, when the pH reaches that appropriate to the desired product. The anode compartment contains the aqueous borate and the cathode compartment may contain the corresponding hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate. The electrodes may be Pt, other noble metals, Fe or C. In an example of the formation of Na 2 O.5B 2 O 3 the anode compartment contains borax solution and the cathode compartment aq. NaOH. The electrodes are of Pt gauze. The cationic permselective membrane is of a sulphonated polystyrene. Electrolysis is at 5 v. for 1 hr. 50 mins. and the current efficiency of the process is 85%.",UNITED STATES BORAX CHEM,JEFFERS WILLIAM;;BROWN MICHAEL PETER,,https://lens.org/060-683-650-154-581,Granted Patent,no,0,0,2,2,0,C25B1/14;;C25B1/00,C25B1/00;;C25B1/14,C7B BDN           DN10;;C7B BDSK          DSK;;C7B B106          DN10;;C7B B148          DN10;;C7B B552          DN10;;C7B B786          DN10,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Seaming non-metallic sheet material. KEYSTONE Ltd. 11 May, 1967 [16 May, 1966; 22 June, 1966; 19 July, 1966], Nos. 21686/66, 32343/66 and 28005/66. Heading B5K. [Also in Divisions B2, B3, B6, C7, D1, G3 and H1] Apparatus for operating on material in accordance with a pretermined programme comprises a structure supporting a number of rows of tool holders, each holder being movable on the structure between operative and inoperative positions, means for traversing the material along a path extending transversely to said rows, means to reciprocate the structure towards and away from said path between an operating position in which only those tools in holders which are in operative positions can operate on the material and a position in which no tools can operate on the material, means for moving all the holders into operative positions when the tools are not operating on the material, latch means associated with each holder for holding the latter in operative position, means for operating the latch means in accordance with a required programme when all the holders have been moved into operative positions, and means for returning non-selected holders into inoperative positions before the structure reaches the operating position. As shown, structure 13, reciprocable towards and away from a moving web of material 3, comprises three spaced bars 15 each carrying a row of tool holders 16 movable thereon and biased away from material 3 by respective springs 19 to inoperative positions in which notches 22 in the holders are displaced from latches 23 operated by respective solenoids 24. Towards the end of a movement of structure 13 away from material 3, the holders engage fixed bars 21, whereby, when structure 13 is farthest away from material 3, the holders are in operative positions and the notches 22 are aligned with latches 23. Solenoids 24 are then selectively energized via a pattern drum 29, whereby towards the end of the movement of structure 13 towards material 3, those tools in latched holders operate on material 3, while tools in unlatched holders do not engage material 3. As shown, the tools are tufting needles 17 which are threaded with yarns 2 and co-operate with loopers 25. The holders may alternatively carry electrodes connected to a source of high frequency current, and brought selectively into contact with superimposed parts of plastics sheeting to effect welding of the sheets at the locations engaged by the electrodes. The rotary drum 29 is provided with a pattern having axially-spaced circles 27 and axial lines 28. A carriage 33, traversed along the axis of drum 29, is provided with a scanning means corresponding to each element of the pattern. Each scanning means comprises an optical system 31 for focusing a beam of light, derived from a lamp 31a and reflected from the pattern, upon a photo-cell 32. Impulses from cells 32 are conveyed via lines 35 to an instep maintenance drive 36 for actuating circuits 38, whereby the appropriate solenoids are energized via amplifiers 40. Alternatively, the impulses from cells 32 may be fed to a recording head 41 for perforating or magnetizing a tape 42, and the latter may subsequently activate a playing head 43 for energizing the solenoids. Alternatively, the impulses from cells 32 may be fed to the inputs 47 of a computer 46, for subsequent replay over outputs 47a.",KEYSTONE LTD,BROWN PHILIP;;JAMES PETER HENRY,,https://lens.org/134-530-413-622-818,Granted Patent,no,0,7,10,10,0,D03C3/20;;D05C15/26;;H05K3/08;;H05K3/1241;;G05B19/4205;;D03C3/20;;D05C15/26;;H05K3/1241;;H05K3/08,D03C3/20;;D05C15/26;;G05B19/42;;H05K3/08;;H05K3/12,B2L LA            LA/L;;B2L LA            LA10;;B2L LB            LB10;;B2L L106C         LA/L;;B2L L107          LA10;;B2L L107          LB10;;B2L L110          LA/L;;B2L L135          LA/L;;B2L L135          LA10;;B2L L135          LB10;;B2L L136          LA/L;;B2L L26B          -;;B2L L26E          -;;B3V VECT          VECT;;B3V V101          VECT;;B3V V4E           -;;B5K K3            -;;B5K K3A1          K3A1;;B6C CA4           -;;B6C CWC           WC;;B6C CWTF          WTF;;B6C CXC           XC;;B6C C10B5         -;;B6C C102          XC;;B6C C1200         XC;;B6C C1201         XC;;B6C C1249         XC;;B6C C34           -;;C7F F1G2          8;;C7F F2T           8;;C7F F4D           8;;C7F F5A           8;;D1G GTB           GTB;;D1G G1F6          -;;D1G G2C10         -;;D1G G203          GTB;;D1G G204          GTB;;D1L L23D1         L23D;;D1L L511          L23D;;G3N NBA2X         BP;;G3N NCA1          CA1;;G3N NCA1          J1;;G3N NGF2          GF2;;G3N N251          BJ;;G3N N251          BP;;G3N N251          J1;;G3N N267          BJ;;G3N N267          BP;;G3N N267          CA1;;G3N N267          GF2;;G3N N267          J1;;G3N N282X         BP;;G3N N282X         CA1;;G3N N282X         GF2;;G3N N282X         J1;;G3N N284          BJ;;G3N N284          BP;;G3N N284          CA1;;G3N N284          GF2;;G3N N284          J1;;G3N N287          BJ;;G3N N287          BP;;G3N N287          CA1;;G3N N287          GF2;;G3N N287          J1;;G3N N352          BP;;G3N N352          J1;;G3N N383          BP;;G3N N383          CA1;;G3N N383          J1;;H1R R2AX          -;;H1R R2A1S         -;;H1R R2J1          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

VAUXHALL MOTORS Ltd. 15 Dec., 1966 [5 Jan., 1966], No. 565/66. Heading F2D. In order to reduce the transmission of vibrations up a gear shift lever, the lever is formed with a stem member 12 the lower end of which is accommodated with radial and axial clearance in a socket portion 18 of an actuator member 14. The stem and socket are resiliently interconnected by a ball 20 of polyurethane having a stepped aperture the walls of which are adhesively bonded to the members 12, 14. The ball 20 forms the pivot for the lever and is resiliently held in a socket 40 of a housing 28 by a spring 42. The lower end of the member 14 is formed with a pair of legs 22 straddling a crank pin 32 projecting from an arm 30 fast with a selector rod 26 which is rotated to select conventional striker members and shifted axially to establish a ratio. In order to prevent inadvertent selection of reverse one leg 22 is long enough to limit movement of the shift lever by engagement with the selector rod 26 unless the lever is lifted against the force of spring 42 to raise the leg clear of the rod.",VAUXHALL MOTORS LTD,BROWN ARNOLD;;TAYLOR PETER NORMAN,,https://lens.org/149-449-986-183-45X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,4,4,0,F16H59/04;;F16H2059/0269;;Y10T74/20165;;Y10T74/20165;;F16H59/04;;F16H2059/0269,F16C11/08;;F16H59/04,F2D DA031         D(AQ;;F2D DC035         D(AQ;;F2D DC037         D(AQ;;F2D DC043         D(AQ;;F2D DC047         D(AQ;;F2D DDC           DDC,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The interconnect layer implements an application programming interface (API) for the reservation system. A deadlock situation is avoided by, during a suspendable phase of a write transaction, making a reservation for slots within the send queue via the reservation system for the transfer of data.

Opposing surfaces (48, 50) of the locking member and the other connector relatively move across each other during movement of the locking member while offering sufficiently low resistance to movement to allow for manual operation. During transfer of the material into the mould, the opposing surfaces are urged together by moulding pressure to increase resistance to movement of the locking member out of the locking position.

Crossings; points.-Relates to a method of constructing points or crossings for electric and other railways and tramways, so that, when portions become worn, they can be easily renewed. The construction is of the same type as that described in the Specification No. 14,511, A.D. 1902. The invention is specially applicable to open points and crossings, either new or old. Fig. 2 is a plan view, and Fig. 3 a sectional elevation, along the line C-D of Fig. 2, of a crossing with the renewable wearing portion attached. The crossing is built up of a continuous rail a and two shorter rails b, that are scarfed to fit against the rail a, as shown in the sectional view, the rails being fixed at the required angles by wedges d and distance-pieces g. The heads of the rails are cut away between the lines 1-1, 2-2 so as to form a recess to receive the removable wearing piece k, which is shaped to form a continuation of the heads of the rails a, b, b<1>. This piece k is secured to the base-plate c by bolts, and, when thus fixed, the bottom edges and ends are luted up with clay and fusible metal s run in to fill up the spaces left empty. The renewable part k is made of manganese steel, and, when worn, can be easily and quickly renewed.",HADFIELD ROBERT ABBOTT;;BROWN PETER BOSWELL,HADFIELD ROBERT ABBOTT;;BROWN PETER BOSWELL,,https://lens.org/135-540-217-518-867,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

This means that to close a pair of opposing leaves, they are moved to their minimum separation, with the gap being convered by the leaf edge collimator. The MLC is after the aperture collimator, so in combination with thin leaves, the MLC leaves will project a much reduced leaf width at the isocentre of the radiotherapy apparatus and collimation of the radiation field by fractional leaf widths becomes unnecessary.

The scheme first identifies candidate sets of column value pairs that are likely to satisfy an algebraic constraint. For each candidate, the scheme constructs algebraic constraints by applying statistical histogramming, segmentation, or clustering techniques to samples of column values. In query-optimization mode, the scheme automatically partitions the data into normal and exception records. During subsequent query processing, queries can be modified to incorporate the constraints; the optimizer uses the constraints to identify new, more efficient access paths.

The constraints may be “fuzzy” in that they hold for most, but not all, of the records, and the columns may be in the same table or different tables. The scheme first identifies candidate sets of column value pairs that are likely to satisfy an algebraic constraint. For each candidate, the scheme constructs algebraic constraints by applying statistical histogramming, segmentation, or clustering techniques to samples of column values. In query-optimization mode, the scheme automatically partitions the data into normal and exception records. During subsequent query processing, queries can be modified to incorporate the constraints; the optimizer uses the constraints to identify new, more efficient access paths. The results are then combined with the results of executing the original query against the (small) set of exception records.",IBM,BROWN PAUL GEOFFREY;;HAAS PETER JAY,HULU LLC (2016-04-05),https://lens.org/139-841-419-972-798,Granted Patent,yes,11,12,4,4,0,G06N5/048;;G06N5/048;;G06F16/2465;;G06F16/2465,G06F17/00;;G06F5/00;;G06F7/00;;G06F17/30;;G06N5/02;;G06N5/04;;G06N7/00;;G06N7/08,706/45;;706/46;;706/50;;706/59,11,6,014-281-460-127-830;;070-674-952-907-727;;004-013-908-315-685;;068-877-810-224-355;;041-619-143-590-025;;021-281-185-811-825,10.1109/2.781635;;10.1007/3-540-45357-1_44;;10.1145/376284.375749;;10.1109/dexa.2002.1046000;;10.1145/233269.233311;;10.1109/icdm.2001.989537,"'Interactive Data Analysis: The control project:' Hellerstein, 1999, IEEE, 0018-9162, pp. 51-59.;;Paul Brown et al., ""ARAM: Automatic Discovery of Fuzzy Algebraic Constraints in Relational Data,"" IBM Almaden Research Center, Paper No. 302, 12pgs.;;Paul Brown et al., ""BHUNT: Automatic Discovery of Fuzzy Algebraic Constraints in Relational Data,"" Proceedings of the 29th VLDB Conference, Berlin, Germany, 2003, 12pgs.;;Anna Manning et al., ""Data Allocation Algorithm for Parallel Association Rule Discovery,"" Proceedings of the Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 5th Pacific-Asia Conference, PAKDD 2001, Berlin, Germany, 2001, 6pgs.;;Jarek Gryz et al., ""Discovery and Application of Check Constraints in DB2,"" 17th International Conference on Data Engineering, Apr. 2-6, 2001, Heidelberg, Germany, 5pgs.;;Parke Godfrey et al., ""Exploiting Constraint-Like Data Characterizations in Query Optimization,"" ACM SIGMOD 2001, May 21-24, 2001, Santa Barbara, California, 11pgs.;;Bogdan Czejdo et al., ""Materialized Views in Data Mining,"" Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA '02), Sep. 2-6, 2002, Aix-en-Provence, France, 5pgs.;;Ramakrishnam Srikant et al., ""Mining Quantitative Association Rules in Large Relational Tables,"" Proceedings of the 1996 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, 1996, 12pgs.;;Pauray Tsai et al., ""Mining Quantitative Association Rules in a Large Database of Sales Transactions,"" Journal of Information Science and Engineering, 2001, pp. 667-681.;;Chang-Hung Lee et al., ""On Mining General Temporal Association Rules in a Publication Database,"" Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, San Jose, California, Nov. 29-Dec. 2, 2001, pp. 337-344.;;Patrick Bose et al., ""On Some Fuzzy Extensions of Association Rules,"" Joint 9th IFSA World Congress and 20th NAFIPS International Conference, Vancouver, BC, Canada, Jul. 25-28, 2001, pp. 1104-1109.",INACTIVE

One exemplary technique involves monitoring for local changes to a first copy of a file tree and updates from another computing device regarding remote changes to a second copy of the file tree. When a change to either copy is identified, a synchronization plan for the change is created based on a default synchronization procedure.

The enzymatically treated pasta dough has significantly reduced viscosity as compared to a similar pasta dough which has not been enzymatically treated by the process of this invention. The reduced viscosity of the pasta dough allows significantly reduced head pressures and/or significantly higher throughputs in commercial pasta extrusion systems. Additionally, the pasta product obtained using the present enzymatically treated pasta dough is less prone to checking during drying, thereby allowing faster drying times, more even drying, and reduced energy consumption without sacrificing product quality in commercial operations. Additionally, the enzymatically treated pasta dough has sufficient workability that it can be used in a hand-held an d hand-operated extrusion system which allows a consumer to prepare the actual pasta product in the home kitchen.
