   The Bit Stream Processor provides a unified scheme to separate any protocol stack into a Packet Path (PP) and a Protocol Control (PC) process. The Protocol Control process contains the control functions that are loosely coupled with the packet processing. The Packet Path process contains not only the data-processing functions, but also all the tightly coupled control processing functions that are not included in the PC process. By separating each layer of the protocol stack into PP and PC processes, the control and packet path for the entire communication stack can be implemented separately. The PP can be implemented in hardware whereas the PC can be implemented in software running on a microprocessor. Since the processing is separated this results in system level cost saving. The overall scheme offers flexibility comparable to software based approaches and efficiency comparable to hard-wired solutions.
