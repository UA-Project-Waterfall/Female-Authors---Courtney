The system and method include multiple decoding channels, each channel processing the read data input signal and generating an output signal, where the output signal includes a data signal when no error is detected, and an error detection code when an error is detected. The system and method also include multiple error correction code (ECC) decoders, each decoder associated with and receiving the output signal of one of the channels and generating a corrected data signal when the received output signal is an error detection code and the error is correctable. The system and method further include a controller for selecting from the decoders one of the corrected data signals.
