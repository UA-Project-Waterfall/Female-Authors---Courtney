The device is composed of a biomaterial compatible with bone and provides an enhanced surface area on the outer surface of the device for engaging the bone, an enhanced surface area within the device for engaging the bone screw, and is composed of a partial shaft design which is greater than 180 but less than 270 degrees around when viewed in cross section. The device preferably has a biased tip for facilitating placement into bone tissue, and it may be used to rescue cases where there have been improperly created incisions, as with a piercing tool, into bone, facilitating the easy insertion of the bone screw into a properly-placed incision.",BALL BRET G,BALL BRET G,,https://lens.org/138-380-408-207-163,Patent Application,yes,5,0,2,2,0,A61B17/7032;;A61B17/686;;A61B17/7082;;A61B17/7032,A61B17/70,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
