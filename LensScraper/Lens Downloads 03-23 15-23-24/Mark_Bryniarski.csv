The torso body has a realistic skin covering the torso and interconnected at a hinge. A chest compression piston supports and resists chest compressions performed by a user. The chest compression piston is engaged with the central chest plate of the torso body by a quick release mechanism having detent locks for securing the piston engaged with the chest plate. A two-piece tiltable head configuration enables detachment of the back half of the head piece, and inversion for nested stacking within the front half head piece. The hollow torso body is likewise configured for convenient stacking, including the compression pistons, in a carrying container.
