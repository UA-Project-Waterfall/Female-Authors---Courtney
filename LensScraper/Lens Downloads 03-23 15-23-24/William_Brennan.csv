    A horizontally extendable and contractible container for handling relatively flat objects. The container comprises a plurality of receptacles interconnected in series. A single receptacle has the capacity to store a relatively flat object or a plurality of flat objects. The receptacles are formed as open sided pockets, allowing for a wide range of object thicknesses to be contained. The facing walls of the receptacles are absent of any protrusions or holes that could inhibit an object during the insertion of the object. When transportation of the container is desired, a flap on the back most panel is wrapped over the top of the container and an elastic strap secures the container and the contained objects for transportation. A sliding mechanism, substantially isolated from the contained objects is fully integrated into the design of the receptacles and provides the necessary functionality to horizontally extend and contract the container. The primary purpose of the container is to aid in the storing and handling of relatively flat objects, especially paper documents that can normally be found horizontally on a desktop in a shingled format, although the container is applicable to the storage and handling of a wide range of relatively flat objects such as disks, CDs, pictures, microfilm and the like.

Brennan, W. J. April 9, [date applied for under Section 91 of Patents &c. Act, 1907]. Liquids, apparatus for treating with. - In a thread - waxing apparatus for sewing - machines, two pipes 8, 9 project from the base of the wax-pot 3 and communicate with one another through the hollow of the casting 10. The thread enters the wax pot tbrough a usual stuffing-box 6, passes along the upper pipe 8, and passes out through the stuffing-box or wax stripper 11. The wax that is carried through the pipe 8 and is stripped from the thread as it passes out is returned to the bottom of the wax-pot by the pipe 9. To make the circulation complete, a lip 24 guides the returned wax to the rear of the wax pot. The wax is heated by three electric heating-coils 12, 13, 18. Two are placed in recesses 15 in the base of the wax-pot and the remaining one is placed between the pipes 8, 9. They are connected in series, and in order to keep the temperature of the wax constant a thermostat switch is inserted in the circuit. The thermostat comprises a curved plate 29 integral with a fixed and insulated arm 28, a contact plate 30 on the free end of the plate 29 and an insulated adjustable contact pin 33. When the temperature rises beyond that required, the plate 29, in expanding, lifts the contact plate 30 from the pin 33 and the electric circuit is broken. When the temperature has been sufficiently reduced, the contact is renewed. The thermostat is placed in a recess 25 in the walls of the wax-box. A tube 47 fixed adjustably in a clamp 45 is provided for waxing the shuttle thread as it is wound from supply on to the shuttle spool. The thread is passed downwards through the tube, or in a thread roller at its lower end, and through a wax stripper 52. The tube is provided with a handle 48 for convenience in lifting the tube out of the wax to pass the end of the thread over the roller.",BRENNAN WILLIAM JOHN,BRENNAN WILLIAM JOHN,,https://lens.org/180-589-142-761-676,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The method generally begins by performing an operation on a wafer using a fabrication tool. Next, volatiles are desorbed from the wafer. The desorbed volatiles are sampled and raw spectral data indicating the content of the desorbed volatiles is generated. The raw spectral data is subjected to a spectroscopic analysis. An operational parameter of the fabrication tool is then modified responsive to the result of the results of the spectroscopic analysis. In one particular aspect of the invention, a controller receives the raw spectral data and processes the raw spectral data to determine the presence of a residual material on the wafer.

   A horizontally extendable and contractible container for handling relatively flat objects. The container comprises a plurality of receptacles interconnected in series. A single receptacle has the capacity to store a relatively flat object or a plurality of flat objects. The receptacles are formed as open sided pockets, allowing for a wide range of object thicknesses to be contained. The facing walls of the receptacles are absent of any protrusions or holes that could inhibit an object during the insertion of the object. When transportation of the container is desired, a flap on the back most panel is wrapped over the top of the container and an elastic strap secures the container and the contained objects for transportation. A sliding mechanism, substantially isolated from the contained objects is fully integrated into the design of the receptacles and provides the necessary functionality to horizontally extend and contract the container. The primary purpose of the container is to aid in the storing and handling of relatively flat objects, especially paper documents that can normally be found horizontally on a desktop in a shingled format, although the container is applicable to the storage and handling of a wide range of relatively flat objects such as disks, CDs, pictures, microfilm and the like.

The method comprises etching a local interconnect trench into an interlevel dielectric horizontally above the substrate. A titanium layer may be deposited across the semiconductor topography. A TiN diffusion layer is advantageously CVD deposited across the exposed surfaces of the titanium layer. A plasma containing N.sub.2 and H.sub.2 ions is used to bombard the surface of the TiN layer. The resulting TiN layer is conformal and has a low resistivity. A tungsten fill material is then deposited upon the TiN layer to a level above the dielectric. The tungsten adheres well to the TiN layer and is substantially free of voids. The TiN and the tungsten may be removed down to level commensurate with the surface of the dielectric. In this manner a local interconnect is formed electrically coupled to the active area.,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,BRENNAN WILLIAM S;;HAUSE FREDERICK N,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC (1998-05-07),https://lens.org/085-492-841-585-785,Granted Patent,yes,5,15,1,1,0,H01L21/31116;;H01L21/31116;;H01L21/28556;;H01L21/76843;;H01L21/76862;;H01L21/76895;;H01L21/76895,H01L21/311;;H01L21/768,438/643;;438/680;;438/681;;438/683;;438/685,3,3,065-380-350-970-767;;068-433-089-438-595;;084-350-347-747-603,10.1557/jmr.1996.0124;;10.1149/1.1837081;;10.1016/0040-6090(94)90479-0,"Musher et al., Atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition of TiN from tetrakis (dimethylamido) titanium and ammonia, J.

The metal introduced into the phospho-sulphurized fatty acid salt may be the same as or different from the metal present in the salt. The fatty acid containing a group reactive with a sulphide of phosphorus may be a hydroxy fatty acid, an olefinically unsaturated fatty acid, or an oxidized petroleum fraction containing hydroxy, olefinic and/or keto acids, specified fatty acids being hydroxy stearic acid, oleic acid, ricinoleic acid, wool grease fatty acids and fatty acid mixtures derived from natural oils such as cornseed, rapeseed, linseed, sperm and castor oils. The fatty acid metal salt starting material may be prepared from the fatty acid or from the oils, fats or waxes which are the sources of the fatty acids; oleic acid may, for example, be neutralized with a metal or a metallic oxide or hydroxide. The product after phospho-sulphurization is then neutralized with the same or a different metal oxide or hydroxide. An additive having good detergent and anti-oxidant properties can be made by neutralizing the fatty material with barium oxide or hydroxide, phospho-sulphurizing with a phosphorus sulphide, e.g. phosphorus sesquisulphide or pentasulphide and then neutralizing with zinc oxide or hydroxide. In examples (1) oleic acid dissolved in a hydrocarbon oil and heated to 275-300 DEG F. is neutralized by the addition of calcium hydroxide and phosphorus sesquisulphide is then added, and reaction effected at 250 DEG F. whilst passing air into the reaction mixture; the temperature is then raised to 275 DEG to 300 DEG F. and barium hydroxide octahydrate then added to the solution and the mixture heated and filtered to yield a product containing phosphorus, sulphur, calcium and barium; (2) calcium oleate is prepared as in (1) and then reacted with phosphorus pentasulphide for two hours at 300 DEG F., barium hydroxide octahydrate is then added and reaction effected as in (1); (3) wool grease is heated to 300 DEG to 325 DEG F. and saponified with barium hydroxide octahydrate, phosphorus sesquisulphide is then added and air passed into the mixture to maintain the temperature at 240 DEG F. A hydrocarbon oil is added to the reaction product which is then reacted with barium hydroxide octahydrate at 275 DEG to 300 DEG F. and the mixture filtered to yield a product containing a high percentage of barium. Instead of using barium hydroxide to neutralize the phospho-sulphurized barium salt a basic zinc compound may be used. Other products referred to are the barium salt of the phospho-sulphurized zinc salt of wool grease fatty acids, the products obtained by neutralizing phospho-sulphurized barium oleate with barium oxide or hydroxide or with zinc oxide, and the barium salt of phospho-sulphurized zinc oleate. Reference is also made to the double lead salts.ALSO:A lubricating oil additive is obtained by reacting a zinc, barium, calcium, strontium, magnesium, tin, lead, nickel, or cobalt salt of a fatty acid having from 12 to 30 carbon atoms in the molecule and containing a group reactive with a sulphide of phosphorus, with a sulphide of phosphorus and subsequently neutralizing the phospho-sulphurized material with a basic compound of zinc, barium, calcium, strontium, magnesium, tin, lead, nickel or cobalt, the weight per cent. of metal in the neutralized material being substantially greater than that in said salt (see Group IV (b)). The products are useful as additives to enhance detergent properties of mineral lubricating oils. The metal introduced into the phospho-sulphurized fatty acid salt may be the same as or different from the metal present in the salt. The fatty acid containing a group reactive with a sulphide of phosphorus may be a hydroxy fatty acid, an olefinically unsaturated fatty acid, or an oxidized petroleum fraction containing hydroxy, olefinic and/or keto acids, specified fatty acids being hydroxy stearic acid, oleic acid, ricinoleic acid, wool grease, fatty acids and fatty acid mixtures derived from natural oils such as cornseed, rapeseed, linseed, sperm and castor oils. An additive having good detergent and antioxidant properties can be made by neutralizing the fatty material with barium oxide or hydroxide, phospho-sulphurizing with a phosphorus sulphide, e.g. phosphorus sesquisulphide or pentasulphide and then neutralizing with zinc oxide or hydroxide. Stability tests are described for a mid-continent solvent refined oil containing the product obtained by reacting barium hydroxide octahydrate with that obtained by reacting calcium oleate with phosphorus sesquisulphide and with phosphorus pentasulphide respectively, and tests for the detergent qualities of a mid-continent solvent refined oil containing a small amount of a phosphosulphurized terpene together with (a) the barium salt of phospho-sulphurized zinc oleate; or (b) and (c) the product obtained by reacting the barium and zinc salts respectively of wool grease with phosphorus sesquisulphide and then with barium hydroxide octahydrate.

    The present invention is generally directed to various methods of controlling copper barrier/seed deposition processes, and a system for accomplishing same. In one illustrative embodiment, the method comprises performing at least one process operation to form a barrier metal layer and a copper seed layer above a wafer, sensing at least one parameter of at least one process operation and determining an acceptability metric for the barrier metal layer and the copper seed layer based upon the sensed at least one parameter. In some embodiments, the method further comprises modifying at least one parameter of said at least one process operation to be performed to form a barrier metal layer and a copper seed layer on a subsequently processed wafer based upon said determined acceptability metric. In some embodiments, the method further comprises identifying a wafer as unacceptable if said acceptability metric falls below a preselected level. In some embodiments, the acceptability metric may be determined by accessing a model that correlates the sensed parameter(s) to an acceptability metric for the barrier metal layer and the copper seed layer. In one embodiment, the system is comprised of a process tool that is adapted to perform at least one process operation, e.g., an etch process, a degas process, a barrier metal deposition process and/or a copper seed deposition process, to form a barrier metal layer and a copper seed layer. The system further comprises a controller that is adapted to access a model to determine an acceptability metric for the barrier metal layer and copper seed layer based upon at least one sensed process parameter for at least one of the process operations performed in forming the barrier metal layer and copper seed layer.

Nov.11, 1964 [Nov. 12 1963], No.45931/64. Heading G3R. A blended fuel product having a predetermined knock characteristic is formed by automatically controlling the amount of a component, added to influence its knock characteristic, in dependence on measurements of deviation of the knock characteristic and rate of flow. In Fig.2 a synchronous motor 64, normally supplied from mains 26, drives a cam 62 which periodically closes contacts 52a, b to energize a relay 36 and advance a motor 30 step by step. Motor 30 adjusts a weight (not shown) balancing a quantity of anti knock agent by means of a lever which regulates a valve controlling the rate of supply of the antiknock agent to a stream of petrol. A meter 60 responsive to the rate of flow of the petrol mechanically controls the follower of cam 62 so that the period for which contacts 52a, b is closed during each revolution, and hence the rate of supply of anti-knock agent, is dependent on the rate of flow of petrol. To ensure that the resultant octane rating is in fact maintained constant a test engine running on the mixture produces an electrical signal at 84 representative of error in the knock value. By means of a timer 96 this error signal is caused to adjust, through an amplifier-servomotor 100-82, the frequency of a source 76 which is substituted for the mains as a supply to synchronous motor 64 during the period that contacts 52a, b are closed so that the rate of supply of anti-knock agent is regulated to restore the octane rating to the desired value. Follow-up is provided by a servomotor 102 during the intervals between operation of timer 96.",MOBILOIL CORP,MOORE RALPH WILMOT;;BRENNAN WILLIAM ROLAND,,https://lens.org/015-345-752-104-856,Granted Patent,no,0,1,6,6,0,B67D7/742;;B67D2007/749;;Y10S44/903;;G05D21/02;;Y10T137/0329;;Y10T137/0329;;B67D7/742;;B67D2007/749;;Y10S44/903;;G05D21/02,B67D7/74;;G05D11/13,G3R RBE99         BE99;;G3R RX            -;;G3R R37X          -;;G3R R7T           -;;G3R R9F           -;;G3R R9J           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

It includes a frame and a plurality of mutually cooperative adjustable board holders. The frame is U-shaped and is made up of framing members (101, 102, 103) each having a linear scale (301, 302, 303) affixed thereto. An adjustably positionable framing member (104) extends across the U and is slidable along the opposed framing members (101, 102) toward and away from the base framing member (103) forming the bottom of the U. Means (171, 173) are provided for indexing, locking the adjustably positionable member (104) to the frame in any desired position. A linear scale (304) is also carried by the adjustably positionable member and all scales have a common datum. The frame carries indexing means (81, 82, 83, 84) to index it to the machine which inserts components. A number of adjustable board holders (321, 335, 601, 602) are slidably carried by the base framing member (103) and the adjustably positionable framing member (104) to receive circuit boards (325) therebetween. The board holders (321, 335, 601, 602) are indexed and locked to the respective framing members in the proper positions for attaching the boards to the frame, and indexing means are carried by at least one of the receiving board holders for indexing the boards to the frame and consequently to the machine for component insertion. Another embodiment of the invention includes a second pair of adjustably positionable framing members (105, 106) slidable along the opposed framing members (101, 102) between the first adjustably positionable framing member (104) and the mouth of the frame. This pair is equipped with similar structure, as previously described, in order that second or further circuit boards (804) may be indexably received and supported between the further pair of adjustably positionable framing members. The plurality of adjustable board holders is universal in ability to receive and index any type of circuit board.

Usage data is stored in non-volatile memory that will persist even if the main power source of the MIU is lost. Because an RFID generates electric current when it receives an electromagnetic signal from an interrogator, the RFID can provide power to the memory, read the usage data from the memory, and wirelessly transmit the usage data back to the interrogator without any other source of power. This can prevent data loss when the MIU runs out of power; for example, when its battery is expended.

The peptized alumina may be an alumina hydrosol prepared by hydrolysing aluminium acetate or alkoxide, by digesting hydrous alumina in dilute acid, or by the process of Specification 552,053, in which amalgamated aluminium is digested in a dilute organic acid; alternatively amalgamated aluminium may be digested omitting the organic acid, the hydrous alumina formed being separated and peptized with dilute organic acid. Suitable alkaline substances for adding to the peptized alumina are ammonium hydroxide, water-soluble amines, or quaternary ammonium hydroxides; sodium hydroxide or carbonate, potassium carbonate, or calcium hydroxide may also be used, but the alumina should then be washed free from alkali cations. The mixture may be held at the alkaline pH at 50-250 DEG F. for 1-48 hours or for longer periods, e.g. 75-150 hours. The slurry formed is filtered and the filter cake dried at up to 1200 DEG F., preferably 150-400 DEG F., for 1-24 hours. Incorporation of platinum may be effected (a) by saturation with an aqueous chloroplatinic acid solution and subsequent addition of ammonium sulphide solution; (b) by saturation with a solution of aqueous chloroplatinic acid solution containing ammonium sulphide; or (c) by impregnation with a platinum solution containing a dissolved inorganic aluminium salt, e.g. the nitrate, sulphate, chloride, bromide or iodide, and also containing an organic solvent, e.g. acetone, methanol, ethanol or isopropyl alcohol or other wetting agent, e.g. sodium benzenesulphonate, a polyethylene glycol, or a glycol ether. The catalyst is finally dried and calcined at 800-1200 DEG F. in air, hydrogen, nitrogen or flue gas; it may be in the form of a powder, irregular fragments, or shaped bodies, e.g pellets. The alumina in the final catalyst contains from 5-100 per cent of eta-alumina. Examples 1-10 describe the preparation of catalysts and Examples (1) and (8) also describe hydrocarbon hydroforming tests for measuring the activity of the catalysts. Example (1) refers to regeneration of the catalyst by treatment at 850 DEG F. and 300 lb. per sq. in. gauge pressure with nitrogen containing 2 per cent oxygen and 0.5 per cent water, and then with air containing 0.5 per cent water at 1050 DEG F. In addition to hydroforming, the catalysts are useful in other hydrocarbon conversion reactions, e.g. reforming, isomerization, hydrogenation, hydrocracking, dehydrogenation, oxidation, polymerization and condensation.

Usage data is stored in non-volatile memory that will persist even if the main power source of the MIU is lost. Because an RFID generates electric current when it receives an electromagnetic signal from an interrogator, the RFID can provide power to the memory, read the usage data from the memory, and wirelessly transmit the usage data back to the interrogator without any other source of power. This can prevent data loss when the MIU runs out of power; for example, when its battery is expended.

In the two wire version, a hand-held reading unit is inductively coupled over two wires via a port located remotely from a meter register. Alternatively, a meter interface unit (MIU) may be connected directly to the register via three wires. Each register includes one or more wheel position encoders. An AC interrogation signal is applied by the reading unit to encoder circuitry at the meter which powers the circuitry and causes the position of each encoder wheel to be read. In the two wire mode, register display information (e.g. the current meter reading) is transmitted back to the reading unit by varying the load (impedance) presented by the register side of the circuit.

Usage data is stored in non-volatile memory that will persist even if the main power source of the MIU is lost. Because an RFID generates electric current when it receives an electromagnetic signal from an interrogator, the RFID can provide power to the memory, read the usage data from the memory, and wirelessly transmit the usage data back to the interrogator without any other source of power. This can prevent data loss when the MIU runs out of power; for example, when its battery is expended. RFID technology can also provide many other benefits and uses when coupled with an MIU, in addition to serving as backup power and communication.",NEPTUNE TECHNOLOGY GROUP INC,HAMILTON DAVID;;BRENNAN WILLIAM J JR;;WILSON MICHAEL A,,https://lens.org/029-521-987-478-252,Patent Application,no,0,0,12,12,0,G01D4/00;;Y02B90/20;;Y04S20/30;;G06F12/14;;G06F12/145;;G06F21/62;;G06K19/0723;;G06K19/07749;;G01D4/00;;Y02B90/20;;Y04S20/30;;H04Q2209/47;;G01D4/002,G01D4/00,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

In the two wire version, a hand-held reading unit is inductively coupled over two wires via a port located remotely from a meter register. Alternatively, a meter interface unit (MIU) may be connected directly to the register via three wires. Each register includes one or more wheel position encoders. An AC interrogation signal is applied by the reading unit to encoder circuitry at the meter which powers the circuitry and causes the position of each encoder wheel to be read. In the two wire mode, register display information (e.g. the current meter reading) is transmitted back to the reading unit by varying the load (impedance) presented by the register side of the circuit. This causes a corresponding variation of the amount of current drawn from the reading unit. The current-modulated signal is decoded by the reading unit and converted into a register reading. The system can also operate in a three wire mode and read older fourteen wire encoded registers.

In the two wire version, a hand-held reading unit is inductively coupled over two wires via a port located remotely from a meter register. Alternatively, a meter interface unit (MIU) may be connected directly to the register via three wires. Each register includes one or more wheel position encoders. An AC interrogation signal is applied by the reading unit to encoder circuitry at the meter which powers the circuitry and causes the position of each encoder wheel to be read. In the two wire mode, register display information (e.g. the current meter reading) is transmitted back to the reading unit by varying the load (impedance) presented by the register side of the circuit. This causes a corresponding variation of the amount of current drawn from the reading unit. The current-modulated signal is decoded by the reading unit and converted into a register reading. The system can also operate in a three wire mode and read older fourteen wire encoded registers. Other features include remote programmability of register characteristics, the ability to interrogate multiple registers which share a common data bus, verification of encoder wheel positions before accepting a reading, real-time flow rate/leak detection, pulse output, and the capability of reading compound meters (i.e. meters having two registers to separately measure high/low flow rates). <IMAGE>",SCHLUMBERGER IND INC,BRENNAN WILLIAM J;;HAMILTON DAVID R;;WYNN WARREN C,,https://lens.org/052-885-151-697-958,Patent Application,no,0,0,22,24,0,G01D4/004;;G08C17/04;;G08C19/28;;H04Q9/00;;H04Q2209/60;;Y02B90/20;;Y04S20/30;;H04L12/00;;G01D4/004;;H04Q9/00;;G08C19/28;;G08C17/04;;H04Q2209/60;;Y02B90/20;;Y04S20/30,G01D4/00;;G08C17/04;;G08C19/28;;G08C19/00;;H04L69/14;;H04Q9/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

In the two wire version, a hand-held reading unit is inductively coupled over two wires via a port located remotely from a meter register. Alternatively, a meter interface unit (MIU) may be connected directly to the register via three wires. Each register includes one or more wheel position encoders. An AC interrogation signal is applied by the reading unit to encoder circuitry at the meter which powers the circuitry and causes the position of each encoder wheel to be read. In the two wire mode, register display information (e.g. the current meter reading) is transmitted back to the reading unit by varying the load (impedance) presented by the register side of the circuit. This causes a corresponding variation of the amount of current drawn from the reading unit. The current-modulated signal is decoded by the reading unit and converted into a register reading. The system can also operate in a three wire mode and read older fourteen wire encoded registers. Other features include remote programmability of register characteristics, the ability to interrogate multiple registers which share a common data bus, verification of encoder wheel positions before accepting a reading, real-time flow rate/leak detection, pulse output, and the capability of reading compound meters (i.e. meters having two registers to separately measure high/low flow rates). <IMAGE>",SCHLUMBERGER IND INC,BRENNAN WILLIAM JAMES;;HAMILTON DAVID RALPH;;WYNN WARREN CANDLER,,https://lens.org/048-721-762-473-018,Unknown,no,0,0,22,24,0,G01D4/004;;G08C17/04;;G08C19/28;;H04Q9/00;;H04Q2209/60;;Y02B90/20;;Y04S20/30;;H04L12/00;;G01D4/004;;H04Q9/00;;G08C19/28;;G08C17/04;;H04Q2209/60;;Y02B90/20;;Y04S20/30,G01D4/00;;G08C19/00;;G08C17/04;;G08C19/28;;H04L69/14;;H04Q9/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The system can also operate in a three wire mode and read older fourteen wire encoded registers. Other features include remote programmability of register characteristics, the ability to interrogate multiple registers which share a common data bus, verification of encoder wheel positions before accepting a reading, real-time flow rate/leak detection, pulse output, and the capability of reading compound meters (i.e. meters having two registers to separately measure high/low flow rates). <IMAGE>",SCHLUMBERGER IND INC,BRENNAN WILLIAM J;;WYNN WARREN C;;HAMILTON DAVID R,"SCHLUMBERGER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SERVICES, INC.(N.

On the computer is stored a predetermined plan of the layout and orientation of the structural members in the frame. This plan includes a design length for each of the structural members. A joint type is selected from a plurality of different joint types for each intersection of the intersecting structural members. The stored predetermined plan is then analysed to derive specifications of actual lengths and jointing details for the structural members to enable the structural members made according to specification to fit together to form the frame. The actual length for each intersecting structural member is variable from the design length depending on the selected joint types.

In the two wire version, a hand-held reading unit is inductively coupled over two wires via a port located remotely from a meter register. Alternatively, a meter interface unit (MIU) may be connected directly to the register via three wires. Each register includes one or more wheel position encoders. An AC interrogation signal is applied by the reading unit to encoder circuitry at the meter which powers the circuitry and causes the position of each encoder wheel to be read. In the two wire mode, register display information (e.g. the current meter reading) is transmitted back to the reading unit by varying the load (impedance) presented by the register side of the circuit. This causes a corresponding variation of the amount of current drawn from the reading unit. The current-modulated signal is decoded by the reading unit and converted into a register reading. The system can also operate in a three wire mode and read older fourteen wire encoded registers. Other features include remote programmability of register characteristics, the ability to interrogate multiple registers which share a common data bus, verification of encoder wheel positions before accepting a reading, real-time flow rate/leak detection, pulse output, and the capability of reading compound meters (i.e. meters having two registers to separately measure high/low flow rates). <IMAGE>",SCHLUMBERGER IND INC,BRENNAN WILLIAM J JR;;HAMILTON DAVID R;;WYNN WARREN C JR,,https://lens.org/071-844-838-795-771,Patent Application,no,0,0,22,24,0,G01D4/004;;G08C17/04;;G08C19/28;;H04Q9/00;;H04Q2209/60;;Y02B90/20;;Y04S20/30;;H04L12/00;;G01D4/004;;H04Q9/00;;G08C19/28;;G08C17/04;;H04Q2209/60;;Y02B90/20;;Y04S20/30,G08C19/00;;G01D4/00;;G08C17/04;;G08C19/28;;H04L69/14;;H04Q9/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

In the two wire version, a hand-held reading unit is inductively coupled over two wires via a port located remotely from a meter register. Alternatively, a meter interface unit (MIU) may be connected directly to the register via three wires. Each register includes one or more wheel position encoders. An AC interrogation signal is applied by the reading unit to encoder circuitry at the meter which powers the circuitry and causes the position of each encoder wheel to be read. In the two wire mode, register display information (e.g. the current meter reading) is transmitted back to the reading unit by varying the load (impedance) presented by the register side of the circuit. This causes a corresponding variation of the amount of current drawn from the reading unit. The current-modulated signal is decoded by the reading unit and converted into a register reading. The system can also operate in a three wire mode and read older fourteen wire encoded registers. Other features include remote programmability of register characteristics, the ability to interrogate multiple registers which share a common data bus, verification of encoder wheel positions before accepting a reading, real-time flow rate/leak detection, pulse output, and the capability of reading compound meters (i.e. meters having two registers to separately measure high/low flow rates). <IMAGE>",SCHLUMBERGER IND SA,BRENNAN WILLIAM J JR;;HAMILTON DAVID R;;WYNN WARREN C JR,,https://lens.org/163-924-627-032-104,Patent Application,no,0,0,22,24,0,G01D4/004;;G08C17/04;;G08C19/28;;H04Q9/00;;H04Q2209/60;;Y02B90/20;;Y04S20/30;;H04L12/00;;G01D4/004;;H04Q9/00;;G08C19/28;;G08C17/04;;H04Q2209/60;;Y02B90/20;;Y04S20/30,G08C19/00;;G01D4/00;;G08C17/04;;G08C19/28;;H04L69/14;;H04Q9/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING

    In order to divert damaging currents into an electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection device during an ESD event, a tungsten wire resistor is incorporated into a current path connected in parallel with the ESD protection circuitry. The tungsten wire resistor has linear current-voltage (IV) characteristics at low currents, and non-linear IV characteristics at high current levels. The width and length of the resistor is chosen so that the resistor experiences significant self-heating caused by the higher currents generated by the ESD event. At a higher current level, the resistor becomes hot and its resistance increases dramatically. As a result the voltage drop across it increases thus diverting excess current into the parallel connected ESD protection circuitry. This limits the current through the resistor and thereby protects circuit elements in series with the resistor.

When the halogen is bromine or bromine and chlorine, the interior of the reactor is preferably maintained at 10-150 DEG C., and when the halogen is chlorine, it is preferably maintained at from -10 to 50 DEG C. Preferred heat exchange means are superimposed flat spirally-wound tubular coils, the convolutions in adjacent coils being out of register.

    The present invention relates generally to protection of integrated circuits from electrostatic discharges and more specifically to the use of devices formed in isolated well regions for electrostatic discharge protection. One aspect of the present invention is an ESD protection circuit that includes a first FET and a second FET. The drain of the first FET is coupled to an ESD susceptible node and the source of the first FET is coupled to a first voltage terminal. The gate and a well of the first FET are coupled together and to the drain of the second FET. The source of the second FET is coupled to the first voltage terminal. The gate of the second FET is coupled to a second voltage terminal. The second voltage terminal is connected to a voltage source that is at the first voltage when the circuit is not powered, and at a voltage above the threshold voltage of the second FET when the circuit is powered. The well in which the first FET is formed is electrically isolated from other wells in the substrate. The electrical isolation surrounding the well includes (1) a second-type dopant isolation regions in a first type substrate surrounding and abutting the well, (2) a substrate doped with second type doping, and (3) dielectric isolation, such as deep trench, STI, and buried oxide layer. The well may be isolated by any of these methods separately or in combination.

   An isolation technique is provided for improving the overall planarity of isolation regions relative to adjacent active area silicon mesas. The isolation process results in a trench formed in field regions immediately adjacent the active regions. The trench, however, does not extend entirely across the field region. By preventing large area trenches, substantial dielectric fill material and the problems of subsequent planarization of that fill material is avoided. Accordingly, the present isolation technique does not require conventional fill dielectric normally associated with a shallow trench process. While it achieves the advantages of forming silicon mesas, the present process avoids having to rework dielectric surfaces in large area field regions using conventional sacrificial etchback, block masking and chemical-mechanical polishing. The improved isolation technique hereof utilizes trenches of minimal width etched into the silicon substrate at the periphery of field regions, leaving a field mesa. A field dielectric, preferably oxide, is formed upon the field mesa and fills trenches between the field mesa and active mesas, leaving a substantially planar field dielectric commensurate with the upper surface of adjacent active mesas.
