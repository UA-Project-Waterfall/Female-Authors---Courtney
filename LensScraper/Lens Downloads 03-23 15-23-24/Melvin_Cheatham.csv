In one example, a method for hyperspectral imaging includes acquiring a series of optical images and corresponding hyperspectral data of a sample; compiling a movie comprising a series of frames each including one of the series of optical images and a slit line indicating a location of a slit for acquisition of the hyperspectral data; identifying a frame comprising an element of the sample located on the slit line; and analyzing the hyperspectral data corresponding to the optical image in the identified frame. Each optical image and its corresponding hyperspectral data are acquired simultaneously and identified by a time stamp or sequence number. The analysis can generate hyperspectral information about the element. In another example, a system for hyperspectral imaging includes a hyperspectral imaging device; an optical imaging device; and a computing device.",CYTOVIVA INC,BEACH JAMES MELVIN;;UERTZ JAMES LAWRENCE;;LIU ANDREW;;CHEATHAM BYRON J;;LAWRENCE SAMUEL M,,https://lens.org/169-269-315-745-404,Patent Application,yes,3,0,1,1,0,G01J2003/2826;;H04N23/10,G01J3/04;;G01J3/32;;G01J3/36,,0,0,,,,PENDING
