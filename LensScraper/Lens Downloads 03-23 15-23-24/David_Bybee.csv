    A bipolar tool for surgical use includes first and second electrically conductive arms each having a distal end and a proximal end wherein each of the first and second electrically conductive arms function as an independent electrode at the joining of the distal ends. A insulating element for electrically isolating the proximal ends of the first and the second electrically conductive arms from one another is provided. The proximal ends of the arms are embedded in the insulating element in such a manner that biases the distal ends of the arms normally in a joined or closed position. This feature enhances the dissecting capability of the bipolar tool. The surgical tool can also include an insulating covering extending from the proximal ends up to but not including the distal ends of the first and second electrically conductive arms for isolating the first and second electrically conductive arms from each other. The insulating element preferably includes prong members for connection to electrocoagulating equipment. The first and second electrically conductive arms may include a sharpened blade at a distal end or a planarly flattened or rounded distal end or a pointed tip at a distal end or a planarly flattened distal end. Preferably, the tool further comprises a tube extending from near the proximal end of at least one arm to an area near the distal end of the arm.
