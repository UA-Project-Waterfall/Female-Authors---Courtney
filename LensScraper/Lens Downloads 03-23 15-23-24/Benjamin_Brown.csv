The output surface of the MCP and the outer surface of the ceramic substrate 60 are oriented facing each other. An imaging element (electronic sensing element) 56 is substantially arranged within the ceramic substrate, and an input surface of the imaging element is exposed to receive light from the output surface of the MCP. The input surface of the imaging element and the outer surface of the ceramic substrate are oriented to position in substantially the same plane. The input surface of the imaging element and the outer surface of the ceramic substrate are disposed at a very close distance from the output surface of the MCP. The imaging element includes input/output pads, and the ceramic substrate includes input/output pads.

One help center feature provides a user with help that is specifically related to a component in the user's computer system and that is supplied to the help center feature by the component manufacturer. Another help center feature detects a condition that degrades performance, and hence user satisfaction, and alerts the user. Another help center feature detects an attempt by a computer system to inform the user of degraded performance and offers the user a solution. Another help center feature provides a user with a commerce opportunity specifically related to a component in the user's computer system and/or to the user's geographic location.

This may conveniently be done by determining the current in the photosensor at a time when the applied bias voltage across the photosensor is equal or approximately equal to n x Vbi where Vbi is the bias voltage about which the current in a single one of the photo-sensitive elements 8, in the dark, changes sign. If the photo-sensitive elements 8 are photodiodes, the bias voltage Vbi is the ""built-in"" voltage of the photodiodes. The photocurrent generated when n series-connected photodiodes are illuminated is approximately equal to the photocurrent generated when one photodiode is illuminated. However, the leakage current (i.e., the dark current) for the n series-connected photodiodes is significantly lower than the leakage current for one photodiode. The signal-to-noise-ratio is therefore significantly increased.

    The present invention are directed to P ¹ , P ⁴ -di(uridine 5)-tetraphosphate, tetra-alkali metal salts such as tetrasodium, tetralithium, tetrapotassium, and mixed tetra-alkali metal cations thereof. The tetra alkali metal salts of P ¹ , P ⁴ -di(uridine 5)-tetraphosphate are water-soluble, nontoxic, and easy to handle during manufacture. These tetra-monovalent alkali metal salts are more resistant to hydrolysis than the mono-, di-, or tri-acid salts, therefore, they provide an improved stability and a longer shelf life for storage. The present invention also provides methods for the synthesis of P ¹ , P ⁴ -di(uridine 5)-tetraphosphate, and its pharmaceutically acceptably acceptable salts thereof, and demonstrates the applicability to the production of large quantities. The methods substantially reduce the time required to synthesize diuridine tetraphosphate, for example, to three days or less.

This may conveniently be done by determining the current in the photosensor at a time when the applied bias voltage across the photosensor is equal or approximately equal to n x Vbi, where Vbi is the bias voltage about which the current in a single one of the photo-sensitive elements (8), in the dark, changes sign. In an embodiment in which the photo-sensitive elements (8) are photodiodes, the bias voltage Vbi is the ''built-in'' voltage of the photodiodes. The photocurrent generated when n series-connected photodiodes are illuminated is approximately equal to the photocurrent generated when one photodiode is illuminated. However, the leakage current (i.e., the dark current) for the n series-connected photodiodes is significantly lower than the leakage current for one photodiode. The signal-to-noise-ratio is therefore significantly increased.",SHARP KK,HADWEN BENJAMIN JAMES;;BROWN CHRISTOPHER JAMES,,https://lens.org/184-823-162-354-275,Patent Application,no,0,0,11,11,0,G01J1/44;;G01J1/44;;G01J1/44;;G01J1/1626;;G01J1/1626;;G01J1/4204;;G01J1/4204;;G02F1/133;;G09G3/3406;;G09G3/3406;;G09G2360/144;;G09G2360/144;;H01L31/02019;;H01L31/10;;H01L31/105;;H01L31/105;;H01L31/111;;H01L31/111,G02F1/133,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

In an embodiment in which the photo-sensitive elements (8) are photodiodes, the bias voltage Vbi is the ""built-in"" voltage of the photodiodes. The photocurrent generated when n series-connected photodiodes are illuminated is approximately equal to the photocurrent generated when one photodiode is illuminated.

    A high speed access bus interface for a communications network. The interface allows uni-directional transfer of data packets at a fast path processing rate of about 10 gigabits per second. The interface uses a master port and a slave port in a chip to chip data transfer scheme. The master and slave ports may have one or more than one data channel for transferring data packets. The master port includes a clock signal for synchronizing the transfer from the master port to the slave port. The slave may send an asynchronous signal to the master port in order to initiate the master port to stop or stall the pipeline transfer of data packets until space is made available in the slave port buffer. In addition to the clock synchronization, the interface utilizes an enable signal, a start of packet signal, an end of packet signal, an error signal (if necessary), a last valid byte signal, and a parity bit signal to identify, address, each data packet in the data stream. If a processing error occurs, the master port error signal to the slave port also initiates the slave port to disregard the previous data packet. The operating frequency of 50 MHz allows the data packet transfer to exceed 10 gigabits per second.

Inbound data from the first data bus are temporarily stored in a receive buffer memory and later forwarded to the storage device. Outbound data bursts are retrieved from the same storage device, temporarily stored in a transmit buffer memory, and later transmitted onto the first data bus. The invention controls the steps of forwarding inbound data to the storage device and retrieving outbound data from the storage device, in such a manner as to make efficient use of the second data bus and to minimize the possibility of overflowing the receive buffer memory during a receive operation, or underflowing the transmit buffer memory during a transmit operation. When transmitting is in progress, priority is given to supplying outbound data to the transmit buffer memory, with any inbound data being processed only if the transmit buffer memory is sufficiently full. When receiving is in progress, priority is given to emptying inbound data from the receive buffer memory, with any outbound data being processed only if the receive buffer memory is sufficiently empty. When neither transmitting nor receiving is in progress, priority is giving to emptying the receive buffer memory, then filling the transmit buffer memory.",DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP PAT LAW,CARRAFIELLO MICHEL W;;NISKALA WALTER K;;BROWN BENJAMIN J,DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION A CORP.

According to the normal functioning on this pathway, fructose-lysine-3-phosphate (FL3P) is broken down to form free lysine, inorganic phosphate and 3-deoxyglucosone (3DG), the latter being a reactive protein modifying agent. 3DG can be detoxified by reduction to 3-deoxyfructose (3DF), or it can react with endogenous proteins to form advanced glycation end-product modified proteins (AGE-proteins), which are believed to be a contributing cause of diabetic complications. Also disclosed are therapeutic methods of using such inhibitors to reduce formation of AGE-proteins and thereby lessen, reduce and delay diabetic complications, as well as methods for assessing a diabetic's risk of developing complications and for determining the efficacy of the disclosed inhibitor therapy by measuring the ratio of 3DG to 3DF in a biological sample following an oral dose of a fructose-lysine-containing food product.",FOX CHASE CANCER CT PHILADELPH,BROWN R;;KAPPLER FRANCIS;;SZWERGOLD BENJAMIN;;LAL SUNDEEP;;SU BANGYING,,https://lens.org/117-898-290-388-038,Granted Patent,no,0,0,14,55,0,G01N33/66,G01N33/50;;G01N33/66,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
