Carr, J. W. June 28, 1906, [date applied for under Patents Act, 1901]. Loom shuttles, changing bobbins and the like in, automatically.-The cop &c. magazines in automatic weft-replenishing looms, such as those described in Specifications Nos. 7161 and 7161<A>, A.D. 1905, consist of endless aprons formed by bars 4, Fig. 6, provided with spring jaws 5 and saddles 6 for the cops and with studs or hooks 7 for securing the thread ends. Round pins or other projections 8, which may be furnished with rollers, are provided on the carrier ends. They are guided in endless grooves 11, Fig. 1, in the inner faces of side frames 9, 10, bolted together. Each side frame may be formed in two parts, which are bolted together. Each apron is driven by sprocket-wheels 20, which are correctly pitched to engage the projections 8 and are mounted on a shaft 18 carrying a ratchetwheel 24, driven by a pawl 31 on a three-armed lever 38, when the weft fails and weft-changing is to occur. In this case, a lever 43, Fig. 4, is moved sideways into engagement with a cam, as described in the Specification referred to above, whereby a rod 32 and a finger or lever 39 are raised and the lever 38 is turned, so that the pawl moves back over the ratchet teeth. The finger 39 passes through a slot in a plate 42 on the lay at the first beat-up ; but, on the descent of the rod 32, the plate actuates the lever 39 on a subsequent beat-up. The shaft 18 is thus turned, its movement being limited by a spring bearing on a scalloped wheel fixed on the shaft, so that the apron is accurately advanced by one division. A gripper on a rocking shaft, which is turned through a quarter of a revolution for each actuation of the cop magazine, feeds the cops from the magazine into the shuttle box, a saddle or cradle on a rod adjustably fixed in a standard on the rocking shaft being used to support cops of varying diameters.",CARR JOHN WILLIAM,CARR JOHN WILLIAM,,https://lens.org/069-342-671-298-80X,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

A three-winged valve d is seated on a washer e in the valve body, the valve being normally closed by the pressure of the fluid entering through an inlet b connected to the water main. The valve is opened by a screwed spindle f, of quick pitch, which embraces the arm g of a lever connected to the ball, the leverage of the ball being adjustable by means of a set-screw h securing the arm g. As the cistern empties, the ball falls and the arm g, rotating, turns the screw f, which bears on a pin k projecting from the centre of the valve, and forces the valve off its seat. The spindle f may be plain and provided with one or more pins on it working in corresponding elliptical grooves cut out or stamped in a sleeve so as to form a varying screw. The pins may alternatively be on the sleeve, and the spindle may be grooved. The valve closes by the pressure of the fluid from the main, and in case the main is turned off, a spring i is provided for closing the valve. The valve may be actuated by an ordinary ball lever working on a suitable fulcrum, and operating the valve by means of a smaller lever.",CARR JOHN FRANCIS,CARR JOHN FRANCIS,,https://lens.org/068-245-993-016-018,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Races, starting.-Relates to apparatus for starting horses, stated to be applicable also for breaking thoroughbreds for racing. Fig. 1 shows a front view, and Fig. 3 an end view, of the apparatus. A frame 1 of the form shown. fitted with flanged wheels 3 running on lateral rails 4, carries a series of depending partitions 15, which form separate stalls for the horses. The partitions slide in grooves which limit their forward motion, while arms on a spring-controlled shaft prevent their backward movement. The horses are kept in the stalls by barriers 29, which, when released, are drawn back by springs into cases fitted to alternate partitions 15. The barriers have rings 31 on their ends, to engage sliding rods 33 working in eyes 32 on the partitions 15. These rods are raised, to release the horses, by the action of electromagnets 5. The armatures 6 of the magnets are connected to spring-controlled bell-crank levers 7 carrying hooks 9, which engage arms on a rocking shaft 10. The shaft 10, when released by energizing the magnets, is drawn backwards by springs, thus raising a rod 14, which is mounted in arms 13 on the shaft 10. The rod 14-as it rises, lifts the turned-over ends 34, Fig. 7, of the sliding rods 33, and frees the barriers. The partitions are padded as at 36, to prevent injury to the horses.",CARR JOHN FRANKLIN,CARR JOHN FRANKLIN,,https://lens.org/125-910-355-483-140,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Knitting machines; spinning and twisting machines and processes. J. C. DOUGHTY. 14 Nov., 1967 [11 Oct., 1966], No. 45375/66. Headings D1C; D1D and D1F. In apparatus for marling or twisting yarns into composite yarn prior to feeding the latter to the knitting elements of a knitting machine, single or composite yarn(s) drawn from initial package(s) is/are augmented by yarn(s) drawn from successive further package(s) and the rotation of the package support(s) is/are determined and controlled, so as to achieve regulation or variation in such factors as colour pattern, bulk, texture, count, twist value and direction, in the composite final or intermediate yarn(s), and/or throughout speed or rate of yarn consumption by the machine, in accordance with the operating requirements of the knitting machine and the fabric it is producing. Examples of yarn include braid ribbon, knitted cords or strips, slub, elastic, metal or metallised yarns and yarns of man-made fibre, wool, silk and cotton. The variation in twist may be controlled automatically e.g. from pattern tapes, cards or chains at the main control position of the machine. A reciprocating motion, derived from such parts as the cam box carriage, yarn feeder or sinker operative mechanism of the machine, may be converted into a unidirectional rotary movement of package supports. In the apparatus shown associated with a flat knitting machine, movements of carriage 30 is transmitted through ""bow"" 29 and spring-plunger coupling 28 to a slider 26 which moves along a bar 27 to move correspondingly endless belts 16 and 21' connected thereto by coupling block 20 and entrained around rotary pulleys 17 and 22 and separate grooves in a pulley 18. At the extremity of each reciprocatory movement of slider 26, a roller 35 on a finger piece 34 engages a cam face 36 of adjustably positioned cam member 33 thereby rotating cam shaft 32, in one direction at one extremity and in the reverse direction at the other extremity. This rotation is transmitted through lever 37, linkage 38, a pair of levers 39 and 40, to advance or retract pairs of pulleys 41 and 42 and thus force a run 24 or 25 of the belts into driving engagement with one side or the other of pulley 15 so that layshaft 12 is continuously rotated in one direction, as are the package supports such as 6 driven therefrom by pulley 13 and belt(s) 14 or cross-belt(s) (not shown). In the arrangement shown in Fig. 4, yarns withdrawn from, say three, static or rotating packages 45 pass through, say four, axially aligned bores 53 in package supports 51 and are enjoined by or twisted with yarns supplied successively from packages 55. Each support is driven, through belt (or cross belt) and pulley, by an individual, manually or automatically reversible, electric motor 58 (which may be preset to a particular speed characteristic). The motors may be individually or collectively subject to overriding speed control by signal(s) derived, for example, from a tachogenerator, as at 60, or photo-electric device(s) (not shown) measuring the speed of final yarn 63 fed to the machine, and operating through eddy-current couplings. All the mechanical and/or electrical drives shown may be replaced by pneumatic or hydraulic transmissions (not shown).",DOUGHTY JOHN CARR,DOUGHTY JOHN CARR,,https://lens.org/063-483-394-718-140,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,D01H1/00;;D01H2700/24;;D02G3/283;;D04B3/00,D01H1/00;;D02G3/36;;D04B3/00,D1C CX2           -;;D1C C1B           -;;D1C C17           -;;D1C C3A           -;;D1D D2L5A         -;;D1D D2L5B         -;;D1D D2L5C         -;;D1D D2L5F         -;;D1D D2L5X         -;;D1F FX            -;;D1F F6            -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The forming means is operated such that compaction of the particulate material in the envelope is effected into a body of desired non-planar form, accompanied by a downwardly-directed flow of the particulate material towards at least one edge (  7, 8  ) of the body (  4  ). In this way a required density distribution of compacted material in the body is achieved.

The decision to selectively provide can be based on client proximity to the content engines, past redirections, content size and type, content engine capacity, content availability and other factors.",LISKOV BARBARA;;CARR JOHN F;;CISCO TECH INC,LISKOV BARBARA;;CARR JOHN F,CISCO TECHNOLOGY INC (2002-03-04),https://lens.org/051-398-308-091-387,Granted Patent,yes,18,154,3,3,0,H04L2101/35;;H04L61/4511;;H04L67/563;;H04L67/63;;H04L67/563;;H04L67/63;;H04L61/4511;;H04L2101/35,G06F15/173,709/238;;709/245,3,1,186-380-090-125-854,10.17487/rfc3568,"Pending U.S. Appl.

Carr, O., and Birch, J. C. Dec. 29. Motors, controlling. -In order that the requisite current may be supplied to the armature of an alternating-current series or repulsion motor both at starting and during running, the position of the brushes upon the commutator is automatically d etermined by means of a centrifugal governor or the like driven by the armature shaft, which serves, in addition, to open-circuit the motor upon the occurrence of an overload or a failure of current. The overload and no-voltage release arrangements are shown also in their application to induction motors. Within the end casing C, Fig. 3, of the motor and upon the armature shaft G is fixed a disc O, provided with two or more radial slots P, within which slide pins Q connected to governor balls R mounted on levers S pivoted to a sliding sleeve T. Pins V at the extremities of a forked lever W enter into an annular groove in the sleeve T, and the lower end of the lever W is provided with a spur-sector 2 gearing with a pinion 3 on a screw-threaded shaft 4, which works through a swivelling nut fixed to one of the arms of the brush-rocker N, so that, as the sleeve T moves along the shaft, the brushes are moved around the commutator. When the sector 2 is moved away from the commutator, a projection 8 thereon bears upon a switch arm 7, and completes the motor circuit between the terminals I, J. Upon the occurrence of an overload or a failure of the supply, the centrifugal governor moves the sector back, and the projection 8 engages with a projection 9 on the arm 7, thereby opening the switch. The brushes are brought into the best position for starting, and the switch 7 is closed by pressing the upper end of a lever Y pivoted on the brush-rocker handle or on a spindle Z and with its lower end in a position for moving the sleeve T.

Cutting ladder tapes for window blinds.-In woven ladder tapes for venetian blinds, as they come from the loom, the warps of the cross tapes cross at intervals from one main tape to the other without being intersected by weft threads. The invention consists in a machine for cutting out these unintersected warp threads. The tape is drawn through the machine by any suitable means and, by the contact of the uncut warp threads D with its teeth C, imparts rotation to the disk B, which is geared to a cam-disk F whereby the cutters are operated. The jaw J with its cutter L is first lowered between the main tapes by the action of one of the cams on the lever O; the cross warps now move up against the jaw, which is capable of a slight movement in the carriage N, parallel with the tape, under the control of a spring P<1>. The jaw K, which is likewise mounted on the carriage N and is supported by a lever Q to which is jointed a link R<2>, is now brought down to sever the threads, by the action of a cam upon a roller R at the end of the link R<2>. The cutting-device is then moved upward by the spring N' acting on the carriage N. Instead of cutters, electrically-heated wires may be used to burn through the threads.",STOREY HENRY;;CARR JOHN DUNCAN,STOREY HENRY;;CARR JOHN DUNCAN,,https://lens.org/033-555-798-355-181,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,D06H7/00,D06H7/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

    An osmotic delivery system for controlled delivery of a beneficial agent includes an implant capsule having a beneficial agent reservoir, an osmotic agent which expands on contact with fluid imbibed through a permeable membrane retained by the implant capsule, a delivery port, and a valve for opening and closing the delivery port. When the osmotic agent expands, a pressure is exerted against a separating member positioned between the beneficial agent reservoir and the osmotic agent. The separating member moves within the capsule, thereby forcing the valve to move a distance such that the beneficial agent can exit the reservoir through the delivery port.

Carr, J. W., and Scholes, C. R. Sept. 2. Loom shuttles, changing bobbins and the like in, automatically.-When the weft fails, a fresh cop carried by a holder is automatically inserted into the shuttle from the front, and the spent cop is ejected at the back of the shuttle. A vertical hopper 2 is pivoted at 4 to a frame fixed to the breast beam. The cop holders consist of flat bars with upturned ends, one of which has a cop spindle hinged to it. When in the shuttle, the holder rests on one side, and the holders are placed one above the other with the cops downwards in grooves in the sides of the hopper, and are normally supported by sliding bars 11 pivoted to arms 12 on a cross-shaft 9. When the weft fails, a chain 36 attached to the weft-fork lever pulls back the lower end of a rod 38 pivoted to an arm 39 and having at its lower end a stud which projects into a slot 43 in a guide-plate 44. A slotted jaw 41 is caused to engage a stud on a bell-crank lever 34, which is continually oscillated by a rod 31 and crank 29 on the cam shaft 30. The rod 38 is thus raised at the next upward movement of the lever 34, and by means of the arm 39 turns a rocking plate 17 from a horizontal into a vertical position, as shown in Fig. 7. Slotted arms 19 are pivoted to the plate 17, and are connected by toggle-levers. A spring-controlled pin 24 is connected to the pivot pin of the toggle-levers, and when the plate 17 is horizontal the end 26 of the pin 24 presses against a fixed cam-plate 27, so that the arms 19 are held apart to receive a cop from the hopper. When the plate 17 is turned, the pin 24 is released, and the spring 28 causes the arms 19 to clip the cop holder, which is brought opposite to slots in the shuttle box and shuttle. As the lay beats up, the cop holder is inserted into the shuttle, thereby ejecting the spent cop holder, which is pushed down a shoot into a receptacle. When the rod 38 is raised, its end acts on an arm 15 on the shaft 9, which is partially turned and held by a spring or weighted catch 49 acting on the arm 15, so that the bars 11 are withdrawn from under the lowest cop holder, and similar bars 7 pivoted to arms 8 on the shaft 9 are moved under the cop holders. The lowest cop holder falls on to the bars 7, and when the rod 38 descends releasing the spring or weighted catch 49, and the bars 7, 11 are returned to their normal positions, this cop holder drops into the opened arms 19, which are now in a vertical position, so that it is ready for insertion into the shuttle at the next failure of weft. The bell-crank lever 34 is yieldingly actuated by the rod 31 so that a dwell is given to the rod 38 in its highest position, and a spring-controlled arm 45 acts on the lower end of the rod 38 to release the jaw 41 from the stud on the bell-crank lever when the rod 38 is lowered. The plate 17 may otherwise be rocked by a vertical rod, which is raised by a long lever when a stud on the lever is caused to enter a groove in a cam on the cam shaft by mechanism actuated by the weft fork. The hopper may be fixed, but preferably it is pivoted, and adjustable abutments may be attached to the lay bottom on the hopper so that when the shuttle is inserted the hopper is pushed back, whereby minute adjustment of the movement of the lay is obviated. It is stated that a stop-motion may be applied to stop the loom when the last cop holder is transferred to the shuttle or to the gripper arms.",CARR JOHN WILLIAM;;SCHOLES CHARLES ROBERT,CARR JOHN WILLIAM;;SCHOLES CHARLES ROBERT,,https://lens.org/010-534-506-945-159,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Boot-making machines. BRITISH UNITED SHOE MACHINERY CO. Ltd. 15 Aug., 1967 [16 Aug., 1966], No. 36519/66. Addition to 931,796. Heading A3B. The machine for simultaneously moulding and out-flanging the heel end portion of a shoe upper of Specification 931,796 is modified in that the inner mould in two parts which are moved apart to tension the upper and means for clamping the upper against the inner mould are replaced by a one-piece mould mounted on a support and grippers mounted on each side of the support for gripping side portions of the upper, the mould being movable lengthwise of the upper relative to the support and the grippers to tension the end portion of the upper. As shown an inner form 500 is slidable on a sleeve 504 through which a heating element 501 passes into the mould. The sleeve 504 is supported by a bracket 506 forming part of structure 510 which is pivoted at 512 to the head casting 1, to allow access to flange-forming members 71 and to facilitate exchanging the inner form for one of a different size, but is normally held in place by springs (522) Fig. 1 (not shown) secured to the base casting 3. A pair of pneumatically-operated grippers 520 are on opposite sides of the bracket 506. In operation, an operator depresses a pedal which opens the gripper jaws; when the pedal is released the jaws close on the upper and move in a toeward direction relative to the mould 500 to take up any slack in the upper. A pneumatic circuit is then actuated to move outer moulding member 9 towards the mould 500 and swing the flange-forming members 71 apart beneath the outer moulding members 9 and then upwardly against them as in Specification 931,796. Air is then supplied to a piston and cylinder arrangement 516 causing plunger 518 to contact an extension 508 of the rod 501. The rod slides heelwards within the sleeve drawing the form along the outer surface of the sleeve, whilst the grippers remain stationary so that the heel end portion of the upper is tensioned and moulded on the form.",BRITISH UNITED SHOE MACHINERY,CARR JOHN FREDERICK;;GOREHAM HERBERT VICTOR,,https://lens.org/148-494-997-187-137,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,A43D21/12,A43D21/12,A3B B30A          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Both components or the second one only may include an extender oil. Suitable curing agents are:-a primary or secondary amine, a ketimine, an imidazoline (e.g. ""Synolide"" 960 (Registered Trade Mark), a polyamide of a polycarboxylic acid, a carboxylic acid anhydride. Many suitable polyepoxides are listed. Examples of suitable phenols are cresols, higher alkyl phenols such as dinonyl phenol, dodecylphenol, didodecylphenol, dioctyl resorcinols, 2,2 - bis - (4 - hydroxyl - 3 - nonylphenol) propane. The extender oils are mineral or synthetic. They boil above 150 DEG C. and have a viscosity below 2,300 S.U.S. at 50 DEG C. Examples are transformer oils, lubricating oils, fuel oils, or aromatic extracts of lubricating oil distillates. Either or both components of the composition may include a diluent, e.g. toluene, ethyl benzene, xylene, alkyl naphthalene, chlorbenzene, furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohols, or g -butyrolactone; or a plasticizer, e.g. fine oil or dilutyl phthalate. The compositions are suitable as surface coatings or binding media. Inert particles, aggregates or pigments may be added. They may be applied to surfaces of concrete, asphalt, asbestos, metal, or wood, e.g. pipes, floors, roads or runways, or used for roofing materials, potting, coating, sealing and impregnating. Examples use polyepoxide A prepared from epichlorhydrin and diphenylolpropane. In Examples (1) and (2) equal weights of a solution of polyepoxide A in mixed isomers of dodecyl phenol with a non-reactive high boiling aromatic diluent; and of a solution of N-amino-ethylpiperazine in mixed dodecyl phenol isomers, an aromatic lubricating oil extract and the non-reactive diluent were mixed together.

For scattering measurements, a narrower beam can be used to gate detection of a broader beam to avoid amiguities associated with off-axis particles. The twin beams can also be used for thermal lensing, fluorescence or other techniques. Different beam diameters can alternatively be achieved in a single beam by controlling the focal length of a beam focussing lens.",HEALTH LAB SERVICE BOARD,CARR ROBERT;;CLARKE DAVID JOHN;;ATKINSON TONY,,https://lens.org/137-401-620-273-671,Patent Application,no,0,0,20,20,0,G01N15/0205;;G01N15/1434;;G01N21/53;;G01N2015/0238;;G01N2015/1438;;G01N2021/1712;;G01N2021/4742;;G01N2201/08;;G01N15/0205;;G01N2015/0238;;G01N2021/4742;;G01N15/1434;;G01N2201/08;;G01N2015/1438;;G01N21/53;;G01N2021/1712,G01N/;;G01N15/02;;G01N15/14;;G01N21/49;;G01N21/53,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
