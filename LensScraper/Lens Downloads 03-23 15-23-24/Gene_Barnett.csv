The region of interest was previously the subject of a diagnostic imaging procedure to generate three dimensional diagnostic image data, selective slices or other portions of which are displayable on video monitors 34. The position of the apparatus 30 in operator space is determined by actuating emitters 32, receiving the emitted signals with receivers 12, and calculating the position of the pointer in operator space. A pair of radio translucent constructions 14, 16 each carry a plurality of radiopaque markers 18 which are positioned adjacent the region of interest. Two or more projection images are taken through the region of interest and the radiopaque markers using a movable x-ray tube 22 and radiation detector 24. The operator uses a control 36 to position cursors on corresponding anatomical markers in both the projection images and images from the diagnostic data to determine a correlation or transform between projection image space and diagnostic data space. The operator positions a tip of the pointer 30 on each of the radiopaque markers and actuates the emitters 32 to determine the position of the radiopaque markers in operator space, i.e. to correlate operator space with projection image space.

   The present invention relates generally to a peripheral marker or markers of blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity and methods of using same in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of a variety of diseases. The peripheral marker(s) of the present invention are particularly useful in the differential diagnosis of diseased states. The preferred embodiments of the present invention relate to methods, compositions, kits, and assays useful in determining the integrity or permeability of a blood brain barrier. The various embodiments of the present invention can be used to identify subjects at risk for developing a disease associated with increased permeability of the blood brain barrier, as well as to provide insight on the ability of an agent or agents to pass the blood brain barrier. Embodiments of the present invention preferably involve the use of subject derived blood samples to determine the occurrence and level of circulating proteins indicative of blood brain barrier permeability or integrity. The embodiments of the present invention also provides screening methods for diagnosis, prognosis, susceptibility, or degree of permeability of penetration of the blood brain barrier by detecting the presence of serum S-100 either directly or through the use of antibodies. The present invention further provides for kits for carrying out the above described screening methods. Preferably, such kits will be used to screen patients for increased levels of S100 protein alone or in combination with other markers of diseased states as a diagnostic and prognostic indicator of permeability of the BBB. Thus, the present invention provides a minimally invasive alternative to direct cerebrospinal fluid sampling to determine the permeability of the blood brain barrier.

An array of receivers ( 50 ) are mounted on a frame ( 12 ) which is fixed to the patient support. The frame carries at least one reference transmitter ( 52 ). A wand ( 42 ) has at least two emitters ( 44 ,  46 )mounted thereto. By measuring relative travel time of the signals from the wand emitters to the receiver array and comparing the travel time with travel time over a known distance from the reference transmitter to one or more of the receivers, the position of the wand in a coordinate system of the patient support is determined ( 80 ). A three-dimensional array of diagnostic image data was taken through the anchored portion of the patient and at least three markers ( 114 ) affixed to the patient. By positioning the wand on the markers after the patient is secured to the patient support, a transform ( 110 ) between the patient support coordinate system and the image data coordinate system is derived. Once the relationship between the coordinate systems is known, the surgeon can use the wand to select locations and orientations on a surface of the patient and retrieve corresponding portions of the image data for display on video monitors ( 30 ).",CLEVELAND CLINIC FOUNDATION,KORMOS DONALD W;;BARNETT GENE H;;STEINER CHARLES P,,https://lens.org/059-022-409-555-297,Patent Application,yes,0,51,7,14,0,A61B17/3403;;A61B17/3403;;A61B10/02;;A61B10/02;;A61B17/00234;;A61B17/00234;;A61B34/10;;A61B34/10;;A61B34/20;;A61B34/20;;A61B90/06;;A61B90/06;;A61B90/10;;A61B90/10;;A61B90/39;;A61B90/39;;A61B2017/00473;;A61B2017/00473;;A61B2017/00477;;A61B2017/00477;;A61B2034/107;;A61B2034/107;;A61B2034/2051;;A61B2034/2051;;A61B2034/2055;;A61B2034/2055;;A61B2034/2068;;A61B2034/2068;;A61B2090/363;;A61B2090/363;;A61B2090/3954;;A61B2090/3954;;A61B2090/3983;;A61B2090/3983,G01B11/00;;A61B10/00;;A61B10/02;;A61B17/00;;A61B17/34;;A61B19/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A stereotaxic wand (40) is inserted into a tool guide (60). The wand has a tip portion (44), a portion extending along a pointing axis (46) of the wand, an offset portion (42) which is offset from the pointing axis of the wand, and at least three wand emitters (48, 50, 52), mounted in alignment with the pointing axis of the wand. The three emitters selectively emit infrared light which is received by two CCD cameras (14) mounted to a frame assembly (12). The tool guide includes a bore (76) extending along a guide axis. The bore is configured for selectively receiving a tool and the tip portion of the wand. An entry point and a trajectory are identified by the surgeon with the wand in the guide. More specifically, a trajectory and location of the wand are superimposed on a diagnostic image on a monitor (30). If the surgeon is satisfied with the entry point and trajectory shown on the monitor, a surgical tool is inserted into the bore while the tool guide is held along the designated trajectory and at the designated entry point.",CLEVELAND CLINIC FOUNDATION,KALFAS IAIN H;;KORMOS DONALD W;;PIRAINO DAVID W;;BARNETT GENE H;;STEINER CHARLES P,CLEVELAND CLINIC FOUNDATION THE (1996-05-17),https://lens.org/086-886-975-637-526,Granted Patent,yes,12,160,1,14,0,A61B10/02;;A61B17/00234;;A61B17/3403;;A61B2017/00473;;A61B2017/00477;;A61B2090/3983;;A61B90/10;;A61B2034/2055;;A61B2034/2068;;A61B2090/363;;A61B34/20;;A61B90/06;;A61B34/10;;A61B2034/107;;A61B2034/2051;;A61B90/39;;A61B2090/3954;;A61B17/3403;;A61B17/00234;;A61B2017/00477;;A61B10/02;;A61B2017/00473;;A61B2034/2055;;A61B2090/363;;A61B90/10;;A61B2090/3983;;A61B2034/2068;;A61B90/06;;A61B34/10;;A61B2034/2051;;A61B34/20;;A61B90/39;;A61B2090/3954;;A61B2034/107,A61B17/00;;A61B17/34;;A61B19/00,128/653.1;;606/130,5,3,009-050-191-467-378;;002-647-445-180-017;;112-858-152-757-474,18222857;;10.1109/42.108586;;2013785;;10.3171/jns.1991.74.5.0845;;2659493;;10.1109/10.29455,"A Computer Assisted System for 3 D Frameless Localization in Stereotaxic MRI Clarysse, et al.
