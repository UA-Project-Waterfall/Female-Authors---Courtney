    A trench-gate MOSFET or ACCUFET has its gate ( 21 ) in a first trench ( 20 ) that extends through a channel-accommodating body region ( 15 ) to a drain region ( 14 ). Within the transistor cells, a second trench ( 40 ) comprising deposited highly-doped semiconductor material ( 41 ) extends to the drain region ( 14 ). This highly-doped material ( 41 ) is of opposite conductivity type to the drain region ( 14 ) and, together with a possible out-diffusion profile ( 42 ), forms a localized region (41, 42) that is separated from the first trench ( 20 ) by the body region 15.  A source electrode ( 23 ) contacts the source region ( 13 ) and the whole top area of the localized region ( 41, 42 ). In a MOSFET, the localized region ( 41, 42 ) provides protection against turning on of the cell's parasitic bipolar transistor. In an ACCUFET (FIG. 9 ), the localized region ( 41, 42 ) depletes the channel-accommodating body region ( 15 A). In both devices the localized region ( 41, 42 ) is well-defined and can be narrow to enable a small transistor cell size. Furthermore, before filling the second trench ( 40 ) with its semiconductor material ( 41 ), the drain region ( 14 ) can be readily provided with an avalanche-breakdown region ( 64 ) at the bottom of the second trench ( 40 ), for example by implanting dopant ions ( 60 ) of the same conductivity type as the drain region ( 14 ). This avalanche-breakdown region ( 64 ) improves the ruggedness of the device. It can also aid current spreading ( 66 ) in the drain region ( 14 ) in the conductive state of the transistor.

    A trench-gate MOSFET or ACCUFET has its gate (  21  ) in a first trench (  20  ) that extends through a channel-accommodating body region (  15  ) to a drain region (  14  ). Within the transistor cells, a second trench (  40  ) comprising deposited highly-doped semiconductor material (  41  ) extends to the drain region (  14  ). This highly-doped material (  41  ) is of opposite conductivity type to the drain region (  14  ) and, together with a possible out-diffusion profile (  42  ), forms a localized region (  41, 42  ) that is separated from the first trench (  20  ) by the body region  15.  A source electrode (  23  ) contacts the source region (  13  ) and the whole top area of the localized region (  41, 42  ). In a MOSFET, the localized region (  41, 42  ) provides protection against turning on of the cell's parasitic bipolar transistor. In an ACCUFET (FIG.  9  ), the localized region (  41, 42  ) depletes the channel-accommodating body region (  15  A). In both devices the localized region (  41, 42  ) is well-defined and can be narrow to enable a small transistor cell size. Furthermore, before filling the second trench (  40  ) with its semiconductor material (  41  ), the drain region (  14  ) can be readily provided with an avalanche-breakdown region (  64  ) at the bottom of the second trench (  40  ), for example by implanting dopant ions (  60  ) of the same conductivity type as the drain region (  14  ). This avalanche-breakdown region (  64  ) improves the ruggedness of the device. It can also aid current spreading (  66  ) in the drain region (  14  ) in the conductive state of the transistor.

Radar or another type of sensor on a vehicle may receive radio-frequency (RF) signals propagating in the environment. These RF signals may originate from an external source and a computing device can be used to determine a distance and an angle to the source in order to identify a power level threshold that represents an expected power associated with the RF signals. The computing device may then perform a comparison between a power level of the RF signals and a power level threshold. Based on the comparison, the computing device may decrease a confidence assigned to the radar coupled to the vehicle and control the vehicle based on the decreased confidence assigned to the radar.

   In a traditional application server that uses servlets, when a request is dispatched to a thread the service() method of the appropriate servlet is called. When the service( ) method returns the response is sent. This is sub-optimal in the case that an asynchronous event must occur before the response can be sent, because the thread running the servlet must block until the event occurs. The invention provides for asynchronous processing of such requests. In one embodiment, the invention provides an extension to the Servlet API which allows the service( ) method to return (and thus the thread to be freed) before the response is ready to be sent. Then when the asynchronous event later occurs the response may be completed and sent.

A Schottky metal (4) is locally provided thereon. A second semiconductor region (2) is advantageously formed directly below the Schottky metal (4), with the purpose of adjusting the level of the Schottky barrier. Around this, a third semiconductor region (3) is formed in the first region (1) at at least two sides, which third region is then of the p-conductivity type and, when it entirely surrounds the second region (2), forms a so-called guard ring (3). A disadvantage of the above known method is that the devices obtained thereby have a (forward) current-voltage characteristic which is not very well controllable and reproducible. This hampers mass manufacture. To counteract this disadvantage, a method according to the invention provides the formation of the second semiconductor region (2) by means of low-temperature gas phase epitaxy, such that it has the first or the second conductivity type, and the third region (3) is formed by means of ion implantation, the second semiconductor region (2) being formed after the third region (3) has been formed. Devices are obtained thereby whose current-voltage characteristics can be adjusted over a wide range with very good reproducibility and well controlled. The second semiconductor region (2) may be provided over the entire surface or selectively within the third region (3) only.",KONINKL PHILIPS ELECTRONICS NV;;PHILIPS SVENSKA AB,BROWN ADAM RICHARD;;DE BOER WIEBE BARTELD,,https://lens.org/136-139-517-205-657,Search Report,yes,5,0,9,9,0,H01L29/66143;;H01L29/66143;;H01L29/872;;H01L29/872,H01L21/00;;H01L21/329;;H01L21/338;;H01L29/47;;H01L29/812;;H01L29/872,,0,0,,,,PATENTED

A method and apparatus are used to compare an intended treatment plan using a radiation source with a delivered plan. This done by arranging markers at known three-dimensional (3D) positions in a detection reference system between a two dimensional radiation detector configured to acquire images generated by radiation emitted by the radiation source and an area where the radiation source is positioned during a treatment. The positions of projections of the markers on an image detected are determined when the radiation source is at a treatment position in an intended treatment plan reference system. A plurality of lines in the detection reference system are calculated, each line being defined by a 3D position of a marker and a 3D position of a corresponding projection of the marker on the detector according to the image. A 3D position of the radiation source in the detection reference system is inferred based on the calculated lines. If no correspondence between the detection reference system and the intended treatment plan reference system is available, the inferred 3D position is matched with the treatment position to extract the correspondence between the detection reference system and the an intended treatment plan reference system. If the correspondence between the detection reference system and the an intended treatment plan reference system is available, the inferred 3D position is compared with the treatment position.",MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC,MEISELS JOSHUA ADAM;;COSTERANO DANIEL PAUL;;BROWN JEDIDIAH,"MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING, LLC (2015-06-15)",https://lens.org/110-621-958-955-295,Granted Patent,no,0,0,26,26,0,G06Q10/107;;H04L51/42;;G06Q10/107;;H04L51/08;;G06F3/0482;;G06Q10/107;;H04L51/08;;H04L67/535;;G06Q10/107;;H04L51/08;;G06Q10/107;;G06F40/134;;H04L67/535;;H04L51/08;;G06F3/0482,G06Q50/32,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

However, at the transcriptional level this has been impeded by the complex design rules governing promoter activity dynamics, preventing de novo -design of regulatory elements with user-defined functionalities. As demonstrated herein, when composite transcription factor binding sites do not function synergistically, mammalian promoters can be constructed according to simple design rules. Host-cell transcriptional machinery components were analyzed in silico to identify transcription factors with desired expression dynamics. Cognate binding sites were then comprehensively tested in homotypic and heterotypic architectures to assess modularity and determine the transcriptional activity exhibited by a single copy of each site. When elements were specifically selected to prevent combinatorial interactions, heterotypic promoter activities could be accurately modeled simply as a function of constituent binding site copy numbers. As binding site order, spacing, and orientation had minimal effect on promoter activity, blocks could be optimally combined and arranged in silico according to context-specific design-criteria. To demonstrate this, CHO cell promoters were created de-novo that exhibited designed activity levels and long-term expression stability in vitro . The findings reveal new insights into eukaryotic transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, and provide novel tools for mammalian synthetic biology.",MEDIMMUNE LTD,BROWN ADAM;;JAMES DAVID;;GIBSON SUZANNE;;HATTON DIANE,,https://lens.org/148-788-313-061-562,Patent Application,yes,2,1,9,9,50,C12Q1/6897;;C12N15/1086;;C12N15/1086;;C12Q1/6897;;C12Q2525/143;;C12Q2525/197,C12N15/10;;C12N15/11;;C12Q1/6897,,62,60,074-634-607-772-699;;170-349-437-207-212;;016-304-732-345-148;;008-535-855-281-023;;042-244-629-791-896;;006-070-149-884-943;;150-589-729-419-708;;064-190-729-217-346;;069-336-151-928-483;;044-737-293-688-307;;006-736-568-302-707;;134-271-444-459-984;;029-789-533-467-046;;037-248-690-399-313;;043-903-953-448-996;;071-466-701-306-791;;114-018-974-699-550;;070-513-772-410-310;;086-420-548-613-082;;074-634-607-772-699;;070-807-817-216-700;;113-694-419-653-462;;041-741-939-848-684;;077-146-425-199-197;;005-909-400-171-332;;084-284-233-234-25X;;120-267-004-957-314;;085-309-020-554-932;;035-606-998-961-506;;060-871-712-542-407;;074-488-086-409-102;;010-366-974-449-033;;070-410-099-672-510;;139-809-218-701-668;;069-144-304-918-352;;115-617-551-613-429;;022-273-375-053-451;;052-730-179-552-64X;;130-968-726-912-42X;;089-522-358-991-935;;134-173-019-546-340;;026-668-730-144-924;;106-097-030-693-045;;141-469-915-688-933;;003-776-279-746-245;;031-997-467-789-124;;012-538-166-311-969;;095-316-222-351-63X;;005-064-637-400-12X;;139-228-905-265-671;;078-808-520-350-496;;100-573-043-957-499;;033-861-294-135-770;;093-025-757-055-295;;038-554-202-253-772;;028-683-679-889-880;;041-205-358-250-626;;104-419-755-827-828;;064-317-754-994-521;;094-495-688-845-199,pmc3775494;;23892608;;10.1038/ng.2713;;28731643;;10.1002/biot.201700259;;10.1038/nmeth.2404;;23474465;;10.1016/j.cell.2014.02.022;;pmc4080642;;24612990;;10.1186/gb4174;;pmc4052382;;25001290;;10.1016/j.jbiotec.2013.08.021;;23994266;;23850860;;10.1016/j.jbiotec.2013.07.001;;10.1186/1472-6750-12-72;;23046908;;pmc3534229;;10.1002/btpr.1919;;24789630;;pmc3234317;;23205156;;10.1007/s11693-011-9089-0;;pmc3511131;;23129659;;10.1073/pnas.1210678109;;10.1016/j.biotechadv.2015.12.012;;26721629;;23664777;;pmc3694601;;10.1016/j.tibtech.2013.04.004;;pmc3719416;;23377379;;10.1038/nmeth.2361;;24280297;;10.1016/j.ymben.2013.11.003;;10.1038/nmeth.3312;;pmc4393883;;25730490;;pmc4039373;;24189399;;10.1038/msb.2013.56;;22609971;;pmc3374032;;10.1038/nbt.2205;;10.1007/s00439-013-1413-1;;24390306;;pmc4024068;;pmc3775494;;23892608;;10.1038/ng.2713;;10.1002/jcb.20352;;15696541;;18455719;;10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.03.034;;20211142;;10.1016/j.cell.2010.01.044;;pmc2836267;;10.1038/msb.2009.1;;pmc2657533;;19225457;;18172436;;10.1038/nature06496;;pmc2672628;;19289445;;10.1093/bioinformatics/btp120;;10.1038/nbt.1932;;pmc3164356;;21804562;;pmc3146043;;20436464;;10.1038/nbt.1621;;10.1093/bioinformatics/btt432;;23933972;;27270715;;10.1093/database/baw088;;pmc4911790;;10.1093/nar/gkt997;;pmc3965086;;24194598;;10.1016/j.ab.2013.09.003;;24036039;;10.1002/bit.25227;;24615264;;10.6026/97320630004271;;20978598;;pmc2957760;;18369429;;10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000039;;pmc2266803;;10.1093/bioinformatics/bti473;;15860560;;21538334;;10.1002/bit.23189;;10.4155/pbp.14.47;;pmc2677908;;19029883;;10.1038/nature07521;;pmc5221423;;10.1093/bib/bbv117;;26822098;;19274049;;10.1038/nrg2538;;pmc3753819;;10.1093/database/bat062;;23981286;;10.1101/gr.212316.116;;27965290;;pmc5204347;;24105743;;pmc3814642;;10.1101/gad.227413.113;;10.1038/nrg3354;;23400093;;pmc1959362;;17784790;;10.1371/journal.pgen.0030145;;3124106;;pmc279552;;10.1073/pnas.85.2.382;;10.1007/s10529-014-1537-y;;24752815;;22387231;;10.1016/j.pharmthera.2012.02.003;;10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.06.028;;23850759;;pmc3834229;;10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.04.004;;20430058;;20177395;;pmc3261768;;10.1038/nrm2851;;10.1101/cshperspect.a012740;;pmc3809576;;24097900;;pmc309783;;10.1093/nar/21.14.3329;;8341614;;10.1186/1754-1611-4-12;;21040586;;pmc2991278;;10.1016/s0921-8777(99)00004-x;;10343649;;10.1093/nar/gkh280;;14978260;;pmc373412;;pmc4199362;;10.1101/gr.168773.113;;25030889;;17652177;;pmc1931564;;10.1073/pnas.0608451104;;10.1038/nbt0790-662;;1369995,"ROBIN P SMITH ET AL: ""Massively parallel decoding of mammalian regulatory sequences supports a flexible organizational model"", NATURE GENETICS., vol. 45, no. 9, 28 July 2013 (2013-07-28), NEW YORK, US, pages 1021 - 1028, XP055484604, ISSN: 1061-4036, DOI: 10.1038/ng.2713;;""Genbank"", Database accession no.

A method and apparatus are used to compare an intended treatment plan using a radiation source with a delivered plan. This done by arranging markers at known three-dimensional (3D) positions in a detection reference system between a two dimensional radiation detector configured to acquire images generated by radiation emitted by the radiation source and an area where the radiation source is positioned during a treatment. The positions of projections of the markers on an image detected are determined when the radiation source is at a treatment position in an intended treatment plan reference system. A plurality of lines in the detection reference system are calculated, each line being defined by a 3D position of a marker and a 3D position of a corresponding projection of the marker on the detector according to the image. A 3D position of the radiation source in the detection reference system is inferred based on the calculated lines. If no correspondence between the detection reference system and the intended treatment plan reference system is available, the inferred 3D position is matched with the treatment position to extract the correspondence between the detection reference system and the an intended treatment plan reference system. If the correspondence between the detection reference system and the an intended treatment plan reference system is available, the inferred 3D position is compared with the treatment position.",MICROSOFT CORP,MEISELS JOSHUA ADAM;;COSTERANO DANIEL PAUL;;BROWN JEDIDIAH,"MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING, LLC (2015-06-15)",https://lens.org/074-303-856-132-549,Patent Application,no,0,0,26,26,0,G06Q10/107;;H04L51/42;;G06Q10/107;;H04L51/08;;G06F3/0482;;G06Q10/107;;H04L51/08;;H04L67/535;;G06Q10/107;;H04L51/08;;G06Q10/107;;G06F40/134;;H04L67/535;;H04L51/08;;G06F3/0482,G06Q50/32,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Sin embargo, a nivel transcripcional esto se ha visto obstaculizado por las complejas reglas de diseño que rigen la dinámica de la actividad del promotor, lo que impide el diseño de novo de elementos reguladores con funcionalidades definidas por el usuario. Como se demuestra aquí, cuando los sitios de unión del factor de transcripción compuesto no funcionan sinérgicamente, los promotores de mamíferos pueden construirse de acuerdo con reglas de diseño simples. Los componentes de la maquinaria transcripcional de la célula huésped se analizaron in silico para identificar los factores de transcripción con la dinámica de expresión deseada. Los sitios de unión afines luego se probaron exhaustivamente en arquitecturas homotípicas y heterotípicas para evaluar la modularidad y determinar la actividad transcripcional exhibida por una sola copia de cada sitio. Cuando los elementos se seleccionaron específicamente para evitar interacciones combinatorias, las actividades de los promotores heterotípicos podrían modelarse con precisión simplemente como una función del número de copias del sitio de unión constituyente. Dado que el orden, el espaciado y la orientación del sitio de unión tenían un efecto mínimo en la actividad del promotor, los bloques podían combinarse y organizarse de manera óptima in silico de acuerdo con los criterios de diseño específicos del contexto.

A signal from the reader powers up the tag, which modulates and backscatters the signal toward the reader. Unfortunately, the maximum permitted RF signal power, self-interference at the reader, tag sensitivity, and channel loss limit the range at which readers can detect and locate tags. Using multiple readers simultaneously circumvents these limits. When used together, each reader transmits a signal to a tag in turn, and all of the readers listen for each of the tag's responses. The readers that are not transmitting do not experience self-interference and so can detect responses at lower power levels (longer ranges). Because the readers are at different locations, they measure different angles of arrival (AOAs) for each response. These simultaneous measurements can be used to locate each tag faster and with higher fidelity.",AUTOMATON INC DBA RADAR;;BROWN III TOM A;;MUELLER JOE;;BLAIR ADAM;;HEWETT SPENCER,BROWN III TOM;;MUELLER JOE;;BLAIR ADAM;;HEWETT SPENCER,,https://lens.org/048-428-354-873-01X,Patent Application,yes,5,1,6,6,0,G06K7/10237;;G06K7/10475;;G06K7/10128;;G01S13/878;;G01S13/765;;G01S13/84;;G01S13/825;;G06K7/10237;;G01S13/765;;G01S13/825;;G01S13/84;;G06K7/10128;;G01S13/878;;G06K7/10475,G06K7/10;;G01S5/00;;G01S5/02;;G01S5/04;;G06K7/01,,0,0,,,,PENDING

However, at the transcriptional level this has been impeded by the complex design rules governing promoter activity dynamics, preventing de novo-design of regulatory elements with user-defined functionalities. As demonstrated herein, when composite transcription factor binding sites do not functionsynergistically, mammalian promoters can be constructed according to simple design rules. Host-cell transcriptional machinery components were analyzed in silico to identify transcription factors withdesired expression dynamics. Cognate binding sites were then comprehensively tested in homotypic and heterotypic architectures to assess modularity and determine the transcriptional activity exhibitedby a single copy of each site. When elements were specifically selected to prevent combinatorial interactions, heterotypic promoter activities could be accurately modeled simply as a function of constituent binding site copy numbers. As binding site order, spacing, and orientation had minimal effect on promoter activity, blocks could be optimally combined and arranged in silico according to context-specific design-criteria. To demonstrate this, CHO cell promoters were created de-novo that exhibited designed activity levels and long-term expression stability in vitro. The findings reveal new insights into eukaryotic transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, and provide novel tools for mammalian synthetic biology.",MEDIMMUNE LTD,BROWN ADAM J;;JAMES DAVID C;;GIBSON SUZANNE;;HATTON DIANE,,https://lens.org/118-493-493-017-916,Patent Application,no,5,1,9,9,0,C12Q1/6897;;C12N15/1086;;C12N15/1086;;C12Q1/6897;;C12Q2525/143;;C12Q2525/197,C12N15/10;;C12N15/11;;C12Q1/6897,,1,0,,,"ROBIN P SMITH 等: ""“massively parallel decoding of mammalian regulatory sequences supports a flexible organizational model”""",PENDING

Such objects representations may correspond to depictions of objects in images captured using digital holographic microscopy. Some embodiments generate object identification data by comparing object representations in focused image(s) with specially configured annotated focused images, for example using a specially trained neural network or other machine learning model trained based on such annotated focused images. The annotated focused images are generated including a plurality of channels, each associated with a different grayscale focused image at a different target focal length of a range of target focal lengths. In this regard, model(s), algorithm(s), and/or other specially configured implementations may learn the spatial features of particular object representations and associated object identification data. The trained models may be used to perform accurate comparisons with the annotated focused images.

Host-cell transcriptional machinery components were analyzed in silico to identify transcription factors with desired expression dynamics. Cognate binding sites were then comprehensively tested in homotypic and heterotypic architectures to assess modularity and determine the transcriptional activity exhibited by a single copy of each site. When elements were specifically selected to prevent combinatorial interactions, heterotypic promoter activities could be accurately modeled simply as a function of constituent binding site copy numbers. As binding site order, spacing, and orientation had minimal effect on promoter activity, blocks could be optimally combined and arranged in silico according to context-specific design-criteria. To demonstrate this, CHO cell promoters were created de-novo that exhibited designed activity levels and long-term expression stability in vitro.",MEDIMMUNE LTD,BROWN ADAM J;;JAMES DAVID C;;GIBSON SUZANNE J;;HATTON DIANE,UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD (2018-03-27);;MEDIMMUNE LIMITED (2018-03-20),https://lens.org/161-969-834-329-070,Granted Patent,yes,3,0,9,9,50,C12Q1/6897;;C12N15/1086;;C12N15/1086;;C12Q1/6897;;C12Q2525/143;;C12Q2525/197,C07H21/02;;C12N15/10;;C12N15/11;;C12Q1/6897,,4,3,047-534-908-890-43X;;086-420-548-613-082;;074-634-607-772-699,25934798;;pmc4477655;;10.1093/nar/gkv423;;10.1007/s00439-013-1413-1;;24390306;;pmc4024068;;pmc3775494;;23892608;;10.1038/ng.2713,"Schulthess et al., Signal integration by the CYP1A1 promoter—a quantitative study.

However, at the transcriptional level this has been impeded by the complex design rules governing promoter activity dynamics, preventing de novo-design of regulatory elements with user-defined functionalities. As demonstrated herein, when composite transcription factor binding sites do not function synergistically, mammalian promoters can be constructed according to simple design rules. Host-cell transcriptional machinery components were analyzed in silico to identify transcription factors with desired expression dynamics. Cognate binding sites were then comprehensively tested in homotypic and heterotypic architectures to assess modularity and determine the transcriptional activity exhibited by a single copy of each site. When elements were specifically selected to prevent combinatorial interactions, heterotypic promoter activities could be accurately modeled simply as a function of constituent binding site copy numbers. As binding site order, spacing, and orientation had minimal effect on promoter activity, blocks could be optimally combined and arranged in silico according to context-specific design-criteria. To demonstrate this, CHO cell promoters were created de-novo that exhibited designed activity levels and long-term expression stability in vitro. The findings reveal new insights into eukaryotic transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, and provide novel tools for mammalian synthetic biology.",MEDIMMUNE LTD,BROWN ADAM J;;JAMES DAVID C;;GIBSON SUZANNE J;;HATTON DIANE,UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD (2018-03-27);;MEDIMMUNE LIMITED (2018-03-20),https://lens.org/092-275-473-475-488,Patent Application,yes,0,0,9,9,50,C12Q1/6897;;C12N15/1086;;C12N15/1086;;C12Q1/6897;;C12Q2525/143;;C12Q2525/197,C12Q1/6897;;C12N15/10;;C12N15/11,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

A signal from the reader powers up the tag, which modulates and backscatters the signal toward the reader. Unfortunately, the maximum permitted RF signal power, self-interference at the reader, tag sensitivity, and channel loss limit the range at which readers can detect and locate tags. Using multiple readers simultaneously circumvents these limits. When used together, each reader transmits a signal to a tag in turn, and all of the readers listen for each of the tag's responses. The readers that are not transmitting do not experience self-interference and so can detect responses at lower power levels (longer ranges).

Such types of smooth muscle include airway, gastrointestinal, bladder, uterine and corpus cavernosal. Thus, S-nitrosothiols may be used for the treatment or prevention of disorders associated with relaxation of smooth muscle, such as airway obstruction, and other respiratory disorders, bladder dysfunction, premature labor and impotence. Additionally, S-nitrosothiols may be used to alleviate smooth muscle contraction and spasm, and thus facilitate procedures involving diagnostic instrumentation, such as endoscopy, bronchoscopy, laparoscopy and cystoscopy. S-nitrosothiols also increase the binding affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen, and therefore, may be used to improve hemoglobin-oxygen binding, and oxygen transport to bodily tissues.",BRIGHAM & WOMENS HOSPITAL,STAMLER JONATHAN;;LOSCALZO JOSEPH;;SLIVKA ADAM;;SIMON DANIEL;;BROWN ROBERT;;DRAZEN JEFFREY,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL (1992-10-30),https://lens.org/017-524-744-259-846,Granted Patent,yes,6,241,3,23,0,A61K38/00;;C07C381/00;;C07K5/0215;;C07C381/00;;C07K5/0215;;A61K38/00,A61K38/00;;C07C381/00;;C07K5/02,514/562,43,39,023-655-132-991-697;;100-136-323-404-682;;091-980-148-150-548;;008-354-245-869-206;;071-009-284-006-662;;076-384-660-162-869;;102-778-449-819-987;;038-778-313-079-271;;129-403-677-051-876;;018-620-329-994-09X;;055-528-405-103-253;;065-224-135-456-891;;098-195-000-538-184;;001-089-608-880-326;;011-353-545-027-987;;055-322-762-544-635;;051-277-834-956-466;;058-055-006-743-693;;109-613-555-865-257;;047-213-642-683-347;;110-931-541-093-11X;;069-201-187-432-035;;047-034-654-241-585;;038-196-340-473-450;;006-827-257-754-179;;043-348-353-580-395;;057-946-685-630-342;;034-871-176-823-463;;095-264-038-509-853;;135-905-864-418-378;;154-052-325-165-989;;136-546-712-620-213;;022-325-936-161-252;;095-271-604-001-68X;;035-780-915-898-358;;060-832-692-863-50X;;109-288-739-993-695;;039-544-111-685-323;;032-358-372-183-600,10.1007/978-1-4612-4588-9_1;;1324362;;10.1016/s0021-5198(19)60048-x;;2553896;;10.1139/y89-042;;2547502;;8248198;;10.1073/pnas.90.23.10957;;pmc47900;;2542037;;10.1016/0014-2999(89)90180-5;;10.1021/jf00117a015;;10.1007/bf00180663;;2333103;;10.1152/ajpheart.1990.259.3.h804;;2396689;;3271606;;10.1111/j.1440-1681.1988.tb01049.x;;3130476;;2496634;;10.1164/ajrccm/139.5.1192;;10.1038/320454a0;;3007998;;10.1016/s0022-5347(17)40074-7;;2107336;;10.1111/j.1476-5381.1989.tb14603.x;;pmc1854778;;2511992;;10.1111/j.1748-1716.1991.tb09103.x;;1858516;;10.1016/0006-291x(90)92168-y;;2166511;;2827174;;10.1073/pnas.84.24.9265;;pmc299734;;6115052;;1975691;;10.1111/j.1600-0773.1990.tb00772.x;;10.1161/01.res.65.1.1;;2544316;;199626;;2863359;;10.1111/j.2042-7158.1985.tb03052.x;;2175799;;10.1016/0014-2999(90)94162-q;;1964906;;10.1016/0014-2999(87)90122-1;;3121364;;2659776;;10.1016/0968-0004(89)90181-3;;2696179;;10.1007/bf01576352;;10.1038/345161a0;;2110626;;10.1080/00304948309355444;;10.1038/327524a0;;3495737;;pmc1853672;;10.1111/j.1476-5381.1987.tb11347.x;;3501321;;3499504;;pmc48254;;10.1073/pnas.89.1.444;;1346070;;3049055;;10.1055/s-2007-1018170;;10.1111/j.1440-1681.1986.tb00313.x;;3011330;;10.1164/ajrccm/138.6_pt_2.s24;;3202519;;2342172;;10.1016/s0022-5347(17)40205-9,"Furchgott, R., Endothelium Dependent Relaxation in Systemic Arteries in Relaxing and Contracting Factors, Human Press, New Jersey, pp. 1 26 (1988).;;Hata, F., et al., Dissociation of cyclic GMP level and nitric oxide induced inhibitory responses in rat colon, Japanese Journal of Pharmacology, 58 Suppl. 2:387P (1992).
