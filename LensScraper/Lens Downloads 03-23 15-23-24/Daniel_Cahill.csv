Aug. 18, 1905, [date applied for under Patents Act, 1901]. Liquid meters.-In meters for those liquids not liable to produce a deleterious effect on metals, the operating-parts are immersed in the liquid, the action of the distribution valve is made nearly instantaneous, and two sets of concentricallymounted counter dials are used. The cylinder 3 is closed at each end by covers 4, 4<a>, fitted internally with sleeves 5, 5<a> in which piston-rods 6, 6<a> are mounted freely, the sleeves and pistons having coned ends. The piston 7 contacts with the rods 6, 6<a> just before it reaches the end of its stroke and pushes them outwards, thus transmitting movement to the shuttle 8 by levers 9, 9<a> which are pivoted at 10, 10<a>, the other extremity being forked and adapted to embrace the pins 12, 12<a> on the shuttle. The shuttle passes through guides 13 ... 13<c>. The levers 9, 9<a> move the shuttle over a part only of its course, the remainder being completed by the action of a pair of calliper legs 15, 15<a> held by a spring 17. At the instant that the levers 9, 9<a> cease to act on the shuttle, the spring levers 15, 15<a> pass the dead-centre of the cam 20 and instantaneously complete the action of the shuttle. The lever 21, pivoted on the bracket 23, engages a slide valve 24 at one end and the forked end embraces the pin 25 on the shuttle 8. The valve 24 is thus enabled to connect the discharge port 26<b> with whichever port 26 or 26<a> is momentarily closed to admission. With this apparatus, the cone valves 6, 6<a> are closed immediately the admission on the same side of the piston is closed by the slide valve 24. The measuring- apparatus 27 of ordinary type is actuated by a pin 27<a> fixed to the lever 9. The mechanism for the indicating-disks comprises a ratchet-wheel 32 fixed on the axle 33, which also carries a pinion 34 engaging the wheel 35 fixed on the axle 36. The lever 37, pivoted at 33, carries a ratchet engaging the wheel 32 and operated by the alternating movement of the pin 25. A spring 40 keeps the coned part of the axle 36 on its seat 39, thus preventing the passage of liquid through the casing. The pinion 41 engages the free wheel 42. The axle 43 passes through the cover 44 into the bridge 45. A disk 46 fixed to the wheel 42 has its upper face divided by radial lines, the latter being numbered. By turning the button 47, Fig. 5, which is fixed to the axle 43, in the direction of rotation of the wheel 42, a cam 48 is caused to abut on the ratchet attached to the wheel 42 and thus rotates it. A sliding pin 50 can be slipped into a groove in the button 47 and the axle 43 arrested at the zero position of the disk 46. A ratchet-wheel 51 is fixed to a sleeve which is free on the axle 43 and also passes through the cap 44 ; a button 52 is attached to the sleeve. A disk 53 is fixed above the wheel 51 and is graduated. The ratchet 55 is fixed to the wheel 42 and engages the teeth of the wheel 51, the spring 57 keeping it in gear ; the wheels 51 and 42 thus have the same motion. By turning the button 52, however, the wheel 51 can be given an independent motion. On the disk 53 is placed a bright mark to give warning just before the liquid is exhausted.",CAHILL DANIEL,CAHILL DANIEL,,https://lens.org/178-666-985-292-243,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Maximum-speed indicators. - In speed indicators provided with maximum-speed hands, the hand cannot be re-set while the vehicle is in motion; or, if released, it cannot again be operative until the vehicle has stopped. In the construction shown, the ratchet-wheel e on the maximum-hand spindle a is normally engaged by a pawl h, but is mutilated at a point g, which, in the zero position of the maximum hand, is contiguous to the pawl. If the pawl h is given a lateral movement by operating the usual push-rod it disengages from the ratchetwheel, and the maximum hand is freed. The pawl h cannot, however, again engage the ratchet-wheel until the vehicle stops, whereupon the speed hand allows the maximum-hand to return to zero and the notch q to arrive adjacent to the pawl h. In order to prevent the lateral re-setting movement of the pawl except when the vehicle is stationary, a disk m, fast on the speed-hand spindle b, is provided with a notch at n which allows the lateral movement only when the spindle is at zero. A ring f attached to the ratchet-wheel e supports the end of the pawl h when disengaged.",CAHILL DANIEL,CAHILL DANIEL,,https://lens.org/065-687-053-780-517,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,G01P1/08,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Counting-apparatus; liquid meters.- The necessity for rotating or sliding fluid-tight joints is obviated in fluid meters of the kind described in Specifications Nos. 18,511 and 18,513, A.D. 1906. The dials a, b are arranged in the meter chamber, and are carried by a spindle c bearing in the cylinder casing and the bracket 2, and removable with the dials for inspection, but normally locked in position by a fork n engaging a groove in the spindle. The outer dial b is loose on the spindle, but is rotatably attached thereto by a screw 4 engaging a groove in the spindle, and is driven by a pinion on a spindle g fast with a ratchet-wheel driven by a pawl on the worm-wheel j driven from the meter. The two dials are reversely numbered and are friction-geared together by the spring d so as to allow the inner dial to be turned back by means of the clutch v, w on depression of the spring plunger r. This plunger is valve-faced, and on depression allows air or gas to escape or enter. The additional totalizing- counter can be seen through windows in the casing. In some cases, the meter casing may be used as a supplementary reservoir and is then provided with a cock or non-return valve. The plunger on the cover is depressed to admit air so as to allow liquid to flow from the meter. One dial only may be employed to indicate the quantity remaining in the reservoir, and is then friction-geared to the meterdriven pinion so as to be set in either direction. Instead of dials, counter wheels with numbers on the edge may be employed.",CAHILL DANIEL,CAHILL DANIEL,,https://lens.org/025-933-594-864-545,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

Sept. 19, 1912, [Convention date]. Spray carburettors.- A rich mixture formed in a comparatively small chamber is admitted, past a needle valve actuated by the throttle valve, into the induction pipe, where it mixes with the main air supply. The main air passage may therefore have a sectional area greater than usual. Fuel from the float-chamber a is sprayed through the nozzle i<1> into a chamber h<1>, to which air is admitted through a small orifice. The rich mixture issues through the passage h, controlled by the needle valve j', into a chamber g<3> where it mixes with hot air entering by the pipe b, Fig. 5. The resultant mixture then enters a perforated tube f which is co-axial with a conical throttle valve c which controls the main supply of air entering at d', and the mixture leaving at d<2>. The tube f is covered with gauze kept in position by a spring f<3>, the fuel being removed from the gauze by the air current. The needle valve j<1> extends through the throttle spindle at j<0>, and is actuated by the throttle through an interchangeable cam l and bell-crank lever l<1>, but may be actuated independently of the throttle by a connexion l<4>, Fig. 4. Fuel may be entirely shutoff and air only admitted to the engine, or a small amount of mixture may be admitted, when the throttle is closed, through an orifice e<3>, Fig. 5. The wire gauze on the tube f prevents flame from reaching the fuel-chamber. Liquid fuel which accumulates in the tube f facilitates starting and accelerating. The, spraying-chamber h<1> is provided with an inspection cover a<4>, and also with a manometer by means of which the rate of flow of fuel may be indicated to the driver of a motor-vehicle or aeroplane. The chamber h<1> may be at some distance from the induction passage and connected to it by a heated pipe.",CAHILL DANIEL,CAHILL DANIEL,,https://lens.org/175-065-695-174-027,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,F02M7/18;;F02M9/085;;F02M15/027;;F02M19/03,F02M7/18;;F02M9/08;;F02M15/02;;F02M19/03,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

SOLUTION: When a pick roller 24 and a lift plate 28 are at standard positions, a spring 64 dose not act to the pick roller 24. As a result, only smaller force of a buckling spring 57 acts to an end part 26 or others of the pick roller 24, and transfers a separator pad 56 to a rising position. Because the separator pad 56 has larger angle than the axial line of the pick roller 24, proceeding prevention of a sheet below the pad is hardly disturbed. This structure a nip between the pick roller 24 and the separator pad 56 is always closed (blocked).",LEXMARK INT INC,CAHILL DANIEL PAUL;;RUSH EDWARD ALAN;;WILLIAMS SCOTT STEPHEN,,https://lens.org/019-529-389-587-68X,Patent Application,no,0,0,15,15,0,B65H3/5223;;B65H2515/34;;B65H3/5223;;B65H2515/34,B41L21/02;;B65H3/52;;G03G15/00;;B41J13/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

   Toner is conserved in an image forming apparatus, such as an electrophotographic printer (e.g., laser printer), by varying the interpage gap when approaching an exhaustion of the recording media supply (paper out). A supply level sensor is used to determine whether the supply of discrete recording media (e.g., paper sheets) is above or below a predetermined level. A smaller value interpage gap is used when the supply level is above the predetermined level. The interpage gap is automatically lengthened to a second larger value when the sensed media supply level drops below the predetermined level. The longer second interpage gap allows for paper out condition that may result from printing of sheet N1 to be determined prior to image formation beginning for sheet N. The interpage gap may be reset to the smaller value when the supply has been refilled to above the pre-determined level.

    Toner is conserved in an image forming apparatus, such as an electrophotographic printer (e.g., laser printer), by varying the interpage gap when approaching an exhaustion of the recording media supply (paper out). A supply level sensor is used to determine whether the supply of discrete recording media (e.g., paper sheets) is above or below a predetermined level. A smaller value interpage gap is used when the supply level is above the predetermined level. The interpage gap is automatically lengthened to a second larger value when the sensed media supply level drops below the predetermined level. The longer second interpage gap allows for paper out condition that may result from printing of sheet N1 to be determined prior to image formation beginning for sheet N. The interpage gap may be reset to the smaller value when the supply has been refilled to above the pre-determined level.

As the media sheet moves along the media path, a first signal may be received when the media sheet contacts the first sensor, and a second signal when the media sheet is at the media width sensor. The distance the media sheet travels between contacting the first sensor and being at the second sensor may be determined. The method may also determine whether the media sheet contacted the first or second paddle based on the media sheet travel distance. Based on which paddle was contacted, it may then be determined whether the media sheet is wide or intermediate.
