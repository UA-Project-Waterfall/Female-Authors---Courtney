    An electricity meter which, in one embodiment, includes a temperature sensing unit for determining a signal representative of the temperature within the meter is described. In the one embodiment, the meter includes a current sensor, a voltage sensor and a processing unit. The current sensor generates an signal representative of a line current and the voltage sensor generates a signal representative of a line voltage. The current and voltage sensor and temperature sensing unit outputs are coupled to the processing unit. The processing unit includes an analog to digital (A/D) converter, a digital signal processor (DSP) and a microcomputer. The digital outputs of the A/D converter are connected to the DSP. The outputs of the DSP are connected to the microcomputer. Temperature characteristics of the meter are stored within the DSP. In operation, the output signals from the current sensor and the voltage sensor are sampled by the A/D converter to generate digital output signals representative of the line current and the line voltage. The output of the sensing unit is sampled by the A/D converter to generate a digital output signal representative of the temperature within the meter. The A/D converter digital output signals are transmitted to the DSP. The DSP determines if the output signal representative of the temperature within the meter is within a valid range. If the temperature signal is within the valid range, the DSP adjusts the line current and line voltage by the temperature characteristics of the meter based on the temperature representative signal. An adjusted energy consumption value is then determined by the DSP using the adjusted line current and the adjusted line voltage.

    A method for interconnecting high-temperature silicon carbide (SiC) devices enables such high-temperature devices to be used in fabricating electronic circuits of significant scale. This method comprises empirically measuring operational characteristics of a plurality of the devices to be interconnected, the operational characteristics comprising devices which are measured to be non-working and devices which are measured to be working; characterizing the operational characteristics in an operational characteristics map; designing interconnection paths between and among the devices that are characterized to be working by the operational characteristics map; and excluding from the interconnection paths, devices that are characterized to be non-working by the operational characteristics map. A preferred embodiment of this method further includes disposing a temporary polymer layer over the devices; forming via holes through the temporary polymer layer, to bonding pads of the devices; applying a current-balancing resistive metal over the temporary polymer layer; establishing connections between the current-balancing resistive metal and the bonding pads; designing the interconnection paths between and among the working devices by patterning the current-balancing resistive metal based on the operational characteristics map; and removing the temporary polymer layer.

    A dc-to-dc converter is provided with overvoltage protection circuitry while still providing normal output voltage. Such overvoltage protection circuitry does not require resetting. The overvoltage protection circuitry includes a first switching device connected between the input bridge and a dc output voltage bus and further includes an overvoltage current path. The overvoltage current path includes a complementary switching device in series with Zener diode circuitry having a predetermined breakdown voltage, and further has a transition current path. The first switching device is closed for nominal input voltage and is open for overvoltages. When the input voltage exceeds the Zener diode breakdown voltage, the transition current path conducts current. When the threshold voltage of the complementary switching device is exceeded, the complementary switching device turns on and conducts current through the overvoltage current path. After the overvoltage transient condition subsides and the input voltage decreases back to the nominal range, the complementary switching device turns off, and normal converter operation resumes.

The power supply comprises first and second full wave bridge circuits. The rectified outputs of the bridge circuits are connected to a preregulator circuit, i.e., a FET circuit, where the primary input voltage from bridge circuits is limited. The output of the preregulator circuit is presented to a filter circuit. A current mode controller circuit operates at a fixed frequency with a variable duty cycle. An output of the current mode controller circuit drives the gate of a switching FET, at the fixed frequency and variable duty cycle. The aforementioned filtered voltage signal and the drain of the switching FET are connected across a first winding on the primary side of a flyback transformer. A second winding on the primary side of the flyback transformer is connected across Vcc, the supply voltage of the current mode controller circuit. The winding on the secondary side of the flyback transformer is connected to a voltage and filter circuit. Feedback is provided by an opto-isolator from the output voltage back to the compensation input of the current mode controller circuit. A voltage reference V.sub.REF is used in the feedback by an error correction amplifier to provide the feedback signal. The power supply of the present invention is particularly well suited for use with electronic electricity meters as such allows a common voltage reference for the power supply and the meter to be used. In a preferred embodiment, the second full wave bridge circuit is carried on a separate circuit board. The attachment of the second bridge circuit board on the main power supply circuit board converts the power supply from a single phase power supply to a polyphase power supply.",GEN ELECTRIC,BALCH RICHARD A;;RIDLEY RAYMOND B;;ELMORE DAVID D;;GERMER WARREN R,GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY (1995-11-28),https://lens.org/112-944-333-046-015,Granted Patent,yes,5,20,1,1,0,H02M7/2176;;H02M1/007;;H02M7/2176;;H02M1/007,H02M3/335;;H02M7/217,363/21,2,0,,,"ABB Alpha Meter Technical Specification Jan. 14, 1993.;;Motorola Semiconductor Application Note Motorola, Inc. 1994.",EXPIRED

The method includes the steps of detecting receipt of a first of a string of binary input characters at a serial input/output port of the meter, and then sampling the detected first character by generating a respective first clock signal which is phase-synchronized with a least significant bit of the first character. These steps are then repeated in sequence for each subsequently received character in the string.

Alternatively, an inert mask may be used instead of the absorbant dielectric to allow plasma etching of the non-absorbant dielectric.",GEN ELECTRIC,WOJNAROWSKI ROBERT J;;COLE HERBERT S;;SAIA RICHARD J;;GORCZYCA THOMAS B;;BALCH ERNEST W,MARTIN MARIETTA CORPORATION (1994-03-22);;LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION (1996-01-28);;GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY (1993-02-03),https://lens.org/132-526-391-963-624,Granted Patent,yes,6,92,4,4,0,H05K3/0041;;H05K3/0041;;H01L21/31138;;H01L21/31138;;H01L21/486;;H01L21/486;;H01L21/76802;;H01L21/76802;;H01L23/5389;;H01L23/5389;;H01L24/24;;H01L24/24;;H01L24/82;;H01L24/82;;H01L2224/0401;;H01L2224/0401;;H01L2224/04105;;H01L2224/04105;;H01L2224/1147;;H01L2224/1147;;H01L2224/2402;;H01L2224/2402;;H01L2224/24227;;H01L2224/24227;;H01L2224/32225;;H01L2224/32225;;H01L2224/73267;;H01L2224/73267;;H01L2224/92244;;H01L2224/92244;;H01L2924/01005;;H01L2924/01005;;H01L2924/01006;;H01L2924/01006;;H01L2924/01013;;H01L2924/01013;;H01L2924/01014;;H01L2924/01014;;H01L2924/01018;;H01L2924/01018;;H01L2924/01027;;H01L2924/01027;;H01L2924/01029;;H01L2924/01029;;H01L2924/01033;;H01L2924/01033;;H01L2924/01042;;H01L2924/01042;;H01L2924/01074;;H01L2924/01074;;H01L2924/01075;;H01L2924/01075;;H01L2924/12042;;H01L2924/12042;;H01L2924/14;;H01L2924/14;;H01L2924/15153;;H01L2924/15153;;H01L2924/15165;;H01L2924/15165;;H01L2924/30105;;H01L2924/30105;;H01L2924/3011;;H01L2924/3011;;H05K1/036;;H05K1/036;;H05K3/0032;;H05K3/0032;;H05K2201/0166;;H05K2201/0166;;H05K2201/0195;;H05K2201/0195;;Y10S438/94;;Y10S438/94;;Y10S438/945;;Y10S438/945,H01L23/12;;H01L21/268;;H01L21/302;;H01L21/311;;H01L21/48;;H01L21/768;;H01L23/538;;H05K1/03;;H05K3/00,H1K KJAE          JAE,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
