    A bicycle carrier fastening bracket has a main body, a base, and a leg extending from the base to support a tube defining a hole for receiving a threaded rod having threaded end engaged with a fast releasing nut. The threaded rod also has a head end and associated head end washer, the head end being engaged with a handle capable of eccentric motion. The tube has a slot for receiving an arresting washer, and there is a round hole in the leg. The handle has a grip with a locking hole corresponding in diameter to the round hole. The eccentric body fastening the handle regulates a distance between each of the threaded rod head end washer and the nut and its respective opposite end of the main body. The distance can be shortened to clamp a bicycle front fork when the handle is rotated to rest the grip against the leg, with the locking hole of the grip rested against the leg, so as to facilitate installation of a lock and confine displacement of the grip. The arresting washer, in a normal state with the bicycle front fork unfastened, impedes movement of the threaded rod, thereby preventing the threaded rod from sliding in the tube hole and maintaining each of the distances to enable the bicycle front fork to be fastened.

Through decoupling an application host from an instance store, the application host can be used with many different persistence stores and persistence administration tools. Further, a given persistence store can be used with many different application hosts and application host extensions. Accordingly, applications can benefit from periodically persisting work to any of a variety of instance stores even if the applications are changed or are not natively configured for use with a particular instance store. Using persistence providers an application host can also more easily coordinate the persisted state with runtime state to ensure that a consistent checkpoint is created. Persistence providers can also be used to compensate for application host extensions and persistence administration tools that add coordination requirements that cannot be predicted at the time that the application is originally developed.",MICROSOFT CORP,ALLEN NICHOLAS A;;BROWN JUSTIN D,MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (2009-06-15),https://lens.org/198-083-217-712-111,Patent Application,yes,24,11,4,4,0,G06F11/1438;;G06F11/1438,G06F9/44,719/318,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The process of executing or reducing persistence commands is repeated until the persistence provider has produced and completed execution of a command implementation strategy equivalent to the original persistence command or until an unprocessable persistence command is reached for which no further reductions are possible.

The load monitor periodically collects sensor measurements of resources available after allocations by higher-priority services. Based on the sensor measurements, the load monitor adjusts the clock speed up or down (i.e., depending on the amount of resources available after allocations by higher-priority services). At the boundary of the lower-priority service (e.g., where work enters the system), work requests are enqueued to be associated with a future pulse of the clock.

Through decoupling an application host from an instance store, the application host can be used with many different persistence stores and persistence administration tools. Further, a given persistence store can be used with many different application hosts and application host extensions. Accordingly, applications can benefit from periodically persisting work to any of a variety of instance stores even if the applications are changed or are not natively configured for use with a particular instance store. Using persistence providers an application host can also more easily coordinate the persisted state with runtime state to ensure that a consistent checkpoint is created. Persistence providers can also be used to compensate for application host extensions and persistence administration tools that add coordination requirements that cannot be predicted at the time that the application is originally developed.",ALLEN NICHOLAS A;;BROWN JUSTIN D;;MICROSOFT CORP,ALLEN NICHOLAS A;;BROWN JUSTIN D,MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (2009-06-15),https://lens.org/077-388-704-539-221,Granted Patent,yes,24,4,4,4,0,G06F11/1438;;G06F11/1438,G06F9/44;;G06F3/00,719/318;;719/328;;717/131,15,7,046-691-552-307-655;;069-583-053-147-008;;076-728-397-873-407;;031-932-432-087-90X;;045-281-305-753-107;;078-379-390-455-018;;067-271-917-733-43X,10.1147/sj.2008.5386516;;10.1145/223784.223787;;10.1109/2.485846;;10.1007/3-540-48743-3_11;;10.1109/icdew.2006.21;;10.1007/11513988_49;;10.1109/mm.2003.1261395,"Lumpp, Th., et al., ""From high availability and disaster recovery to business continuity solutions"", IBM Systems Journal, vol. 47, No. 4, Jun. 3, 2008, pp. 605-619.;;Wang, Lan, et al., ""Persistent Detection and Recovery of State Inconsistencies"", Aug. 8, 2006, 23 pages.;;Rodriguez, Jesus, ""Window Workflow Foundation Runtime Services; The Persistence Service"", Oct. 5, 2005, 14 pages.;;Adya, Atul, et al., ""Efficient Optimistic Concurrency Control Using Loosely Synchronized Clocks"", Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD Internationl Conference on Management of Data, San Jose, CA, May 1995, 12 pages.;;Raynal, Michel, et al.

Accordingly, applications can benefit from periodically persisting work to any of a variety of instance stores even if the applications are changed or are not natively configured for use with a particular instance store. Using persistence providers an application host can also more easily coordinate the persisted state with runtime state to ensure that a consistent checkpoint is created.

Further, a given persistence store can be used with many different application hosts and application host extensions. Accordingly, applications can benefit from periodically persisting work to any of a variety of instance stores even if the applications are changed or are not natively configured for use with a particular instance store. Using persistence providers an application host can also more easily coordinate the persisted state with runtime state to ensure that a consistent checkpoint is created. Persistence providers can also be used to compensate for application host extensions and persistence administration tools that add coordination requirements that cannot be predicted at the time that the application is originally developed.",ALLEN NICHOLAS A;;BROWN JUSTIN D;;MICROSOFT CORP,ALLEN NICHOLAS A;;BROWN JUSTIN D,MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (2009-06-15),https://lens.org/166-176-648-562-129,Granted Patent,yes,29,0,4,4,0,G06F11/1438;;G06F11/1438,G06F9/54,719/313;;707/705;;707/756;;714/15,18,7,046-691-552-307-655;;069-583-053-147-008;;076-728-397-873-407;;031-932-432-087-90X;;045-281-305-753-107;;078-379-390-455-018;;067-271-917-733-43X,10.1147/sj.2008.5386516;;10.1145/223784.223787;;10.1109/2.485846;;10.1007/3-540-48743-3_11;;10.1109/icdew.2006.21;;10.1007/11513988_49;;10.1109/mm.2003.1261395,"Lumpp, Th, et al., ""From high availability and disaster recovery to business continuity solutions"", IBM Systems Journal, vol. 47, No. 4, Jun. 3, 2008, pp. 605-619.;;Wang, Lan, et al., ""Persistent Detection and Recovery of State Inconsistencies"", Aug. 8, 2006, 23 pages.;;Rodriguez, Jesus, Window Workflow Foundation Runtime Services; The Persistence Service:, Oct. 5, 2005 14 pages.;;Adya, Atul, et al., ""Efficient Optimistic Concurrency Control Using Loosely Synchronized Clocks"", Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, San Jose, CA, May 1995, 12 pages.;;Raynal, Michel, et al.

A cap box houses blasting caps coupled to the end of the shock tube. A priming well is coupled to the cap box/blasting caps and the detonating cord. When the firing actuator is initiated, the percussion caps ignite, sending an explosive wave into the adapter, which channels the wave into the shock tube and ignites the shock tube. The explosive wave travels through the shock tube and activates the blasting caps, which activate the detonating cord in the priming well. The explosive is placed in a location to provide a desired explosive effect. For example, the system may be employed as a system to breach structures or other applications.

Subcutaneous insulin infusions can be administered to compensate for advancing hyperglycemia, but for hypoglycemic situations increased TPN (and specifically dextrose) delivery is indicated. Thus, infusion of both TPN and insulin as presently practiced is complex and time consuming.

The coordinated message exchange protocol allows the instance to send a message to a receiver, to acknowledge that the message has been received, and to confirm the acknowledgement to the receiver.",MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC,TAYLOR JOHN;;BROWN JUSTIN;;WOLF KENNETH;;PINTO EDMUND;;BATRES STEFAN;;TALBERT NATHAN,MICROSOFT CORPORATION (2011-05-31),https://lens.org/043-255-314-468-488,Granted Patent,yes,22,0,11,11,0,G06F8/20;;G06F9/542;;G06F9/522;;G06F9/546;;G06F9/522;;G06F9/546;;G06F8/20;;G06F9/542;;G06F9/06;;H04L1/08;;H04L67/1095,G06F9/44;;G06F9/06;;G06F9/52;;G06F9/54;;H04L1/08;;H04L29/08,,8,1,025-833-500-781-709,10.1007/bf01379320,"""International Search Report"", Mailed Date: Dec. 27, 2012, Application No. PCT/US2012/039877, Filed Date: May 29, 2012, pp. 9.;;Cabrera, Luis Felipe, et al., ""An Introduction to the Web Services Architecture and Its Specifications,"" Version 2.0, MSDN, 2004, (40 pages), downloaded from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms996441 (d=printer).aspx on Apr. 5, 2001.;;Simpkins, Cliff, ""Developing and Managing Service with Windows Server AppFabric,"" Nov. 17, 2009, (3 pages), downloaded from http://blogs.msdn.com/b/endpoint/archive/2009/11 /17/developing-and-managing-services- . . . on Apr. 4, 2011.;;Houston, Peter, ""Building Distributed Applications with Message Queuing Middleware,"" MSDN, 2011 (10 pages), downloaded from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc723260(d=printer).aspx on Apr. 4, 2011.;;Weibeta, Gerhard, ""A Multiagent Perspective of Parallel and Distributed Machine Learning"" (5 pages), Institut für Informatik, Technische Universität München, München, Germany.;;European Patent Office, ""Supplementary European Search Report"" issued in European Patent Application No. 12792169.0, Mailed Date: Mar. 16, 2016, 6 Pages.;;SIPO, ""Notice of the First Office Action,"" issued in Chinese Application No. 201280026757.7, Mailed Date: Mar. 28, 2016, 11 Pages.;;Hensgen, Debra, et al., ""Two Algorithms for Barrier Synchronization"", International Journal of Parallel Programming, vol. 17, Issue 1, Feb. 1, 1988, 17 Pages.",ACTIVE

Initial connection requests from new clients are directed to a single entry-point service resource in the cluster, called an intake. A separate intake is designated for each type of service provided by the cluster. The clients are processed in a group at the service resource currently designated as the intake to which clients initially connected, for the duration of the session. Based upon its loading, the current intake service resource determines that another service resource in the cluster should become a new intake for subsequent connection requests received from new clients. Selection of another service resource to become the new intake is based on the current work load of each resource in the cluster. All resources in the cluster are periodically informed of the resource for each service being provided that was last designated as the intake, and of the current load on each resource in the cluster.

The first set of pulses has a different polarization than the second set of pulses. The polarizing beam splitter, the wave plate, and the set of mirrors create a ring cavity. The polarizing beam splitter transmits the first set of pulses as an output of the pulse multiplier and reflects the second set of pulses into the ring cavity. This pulse multiplier can inexpensively reduce the peak power per pulse while increasing the number of pulses per second with minimal total power loss.",KLA TENCOR CORP;;CHUANG YUNG-HO;;ARMSTRONG JOSEPH J;;LIOU JUSTIN DIANHUAN;;DRIBINSKI VLADIMIR;;BROWN DAVID L,CHUANG YUNG-HO;;ARMSTRONG JOSEPH J;;LIOU JUSTIN DIANHUAN;;DRIBINSKI VLADIMIR;;BROWN DAVID L,,https://lens.org/118-463-219-991-188,Patent Application,yes,0,5,20,20,0,G01N21/21;;G01N21/21;;G01N21/9501;;G01N21/9501;;G01N2201/06113;;G01N2201/06113;;G01N2201/0683;;G01N2201/0683;;G01N2201/0697;;G01N2201/0697;;G02B5/0816;;G02B5/0816;;G02B5/3083;;G02B5/3083;;G02B27/281;;G02B27/281;;G02B27/281;;G02B27/283;;G02B27/283;;G02B27/286;;G02B27/286;;H01S3/0057;;H01S3/0057;;H01S3/083;;H01S3/0057;;H01S3/083,,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The clients are processed in a group at the service resource currently designated as the intake to which clients initially connected, for the duration of the session. Based upon its loading, the current intake service resource determines that another service resource in the cluster should become a new intake for subsequent connection requests received from new clients. Selection of another service resource to become the new intake is based on the current work load of each resource in the cluster. All resources in the cluster are periodically informed of the resource for each service being provided that was last designated as the intake, and of the current load on each resource in the cluster.

This pulse multiplier can inexpensively reduce the peak power per pulse while increasing the number of pulses per second with minimal total power loss.",CHUANG YUNG-HO;;ARMSTRONG J JOSEPH;;LIOU JUSTIN DIANHUAN;;DRIBINSKI VLADIMIR;;BROWN DAVID L;;KLA TENCOR CORP,CHUANG YUNG-HO;;ARMSTRONG J JOSEPH;;LIOU JUSTIN DIANHUAN;;DRIBINSKI VLADIMIR;;BROWN DAVID L,KLA-TENCOR CORPORATION (2012-05-24),https://lens.org/065-205-437-658-380,Patent Application,yes,12,34,20,20,0,G01N21/21;;G01N21/21;;G01N21/9501;;G01N21/9501;;G01N2201/06113;;G01N2201/06113;;G01N2201/0683;;G01N2201/0683;;G01N2201/0697;;G01N2201/0697;;G02B5/0816;;G02B5/0816;;G02B5/3083;;G02B5/3083;;G02B27/281;;G02B27/281;;G02B27/281;;G02B27/283;;G02B27/283;;G02B27/286;;G02B27/286;;H01S3/0057;;H01S3/0057;;H01S3/083;;H01S3/0057;;H01S3/083,G02B27/28,359/489.08,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Upon detecting a trigger event causing a mobile computing device to transition from a low-power state to an active state, the device can determine whether the trigger event occurs within the expiration window of a timer, and execute tasks associated with the trigger event and the timer. Tasks associated with state-based timers can be executed if the mobile computing device or a component thereof is in (or, alternatively, not in) a specified state. A mobile computing device can execute tasks associated with multiple keep-alive timers used for maintaining communication links between the device and cloud-based service providers in a single active state. A cloud-based keep-alive service can maintain mobile computing device-service provider communication links by sending one keep-alive communication to a mobile computing device in place of multiple communications.",PINGILI SUDEESH R;;SIRAVARA BHARATH;;REGEN MARTIN;;BROWN RAY;;MANN JUSTIN;;KAROUBI STEPHANE;;XU LI;;MICROSOFT CORP,PINGILI SUDEESH R;;SIRAVARA BHARATH;;REGEN MARTIN;;BROWN RAY;;MANN JUSTIN;;KAROUBI STEPHANE;;XU LI,MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (2011-02-01),https://lens.org/183-974-207-631-62X,Patent Application,yes,15,92,13,13,0,G06F9/4418;;G06F1/3206;;H04W52/0261;;H04W52/0251;;Y02D10/00;;Y02D30/70;;H04W4/20;;G06F9/4418;;G06F1/3206;;Y02D10/00;;Y02D30/70;;H04W52/0251;;H04W52/0261;;H04W4/20,G06F9/44;;H04W4/20,719/318,3,3,020-863-125-646-593;;043-268-232-180-176;;152-496-523-453-839,10.1109/iri.2008.4583051;;10.1109/nswctc.2010.194;;10.1109/pimrc.2011.6139858,"Ying Jin; Bhavsar, Tejaswitha, ""Incorporating fuzziness into timer-triggers for temporal event handling,"" Information Reuse and Integration, 2008.
