User profiles may be created by network administrators, and the corresponding user profile data may be stored in a central network management system (NMS) database. When a user requests data from a particular network device, the NMS utilizes the user profile data in the central database to access the network device and retrieve the required network device data. Since the user profile data is stored in a central database, the user may log into the NMS from any location and connect to any network device in the network. Further, the user profile data may be used to limit which network devices and which network device configured resources the user may access as well as the user's access level.",CIENA CORP,BLACK DARRYL;;PERRY THOMAS R,EQUIPE COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (2000-10-26);;CIENA CORPORATION (2004-12-10),https://lens.org/093-477-865-612-404,Granted Patent,yes,37,264,1,50,0,H04L41/0213;;H04L41/0659;;H04L41/0681;;H04L41/0806;;H04L41/0843;;H04L41/0856;;H04L41/0893;;H04L41/28;;H04L43/0811;;H04L43/0829;;H04L43/0852;;H04L43/16;;H04L43/50;;H04L63/083;;H04L63/105;;H04L41/0894;;H04L41/28;;H04L41/0893;;H04L41/0659;;H04L43/0852;;H04L43/50;;H04L41/0806;;H04L41/0843;;H04L63/105;;H04L41/0681;;H04L41/0213;;H04L43/0811;;H04L43/0829;;H04L43/16;;H04L63/083;;H04L41/0856,G06F15/173;;G06F3/00;;G06F15/16,709/223;;709/229;;715/744,14,0,,,"""The Abatis Network Services Contractor,"" Abatis Systems Corporation product literature, 1999.;;AtiMe-3E Data Sheet, 1-17 (Mar. 8, 2000).;;""Configuration,"" Cisco Systems Inc. webpage, pp. 1-32 (Sep. 20, 1999).;;Leroux, P., ""The New Business Imperative: Achieving Shorter Development Cycles while Improving Product Quality,"" QNX Software Systems Ltd. webpage, (1999).;;NavisXtend Accounting Server, Ascend Communications, Inc. product information (1997).;;NavisXtend Fault Server, Ascend Communications, Inc. product information (1997).;;NavisXtend Provisioning Server, Ascend Communications, Inc. product information (1997).;;""Optimizing Routing Software for Reliable Internet Growth,"" JUNOS product literature (1998).;;PMC-Sierra, Inc. website (Mar. 24, 2000).;;Raddalgoda, M., ""Failure-proof Telecommunications Products: Changing Expectations About Networking Reliability with Microkernel RTOS Technology,"" QNX Software Systems Ltd. webpage, (1999).;;""Start Here: Basics and Installation of Microsoft Windows NT Workstation,"" product literature (1998).;;Syndesis Limited product literature, 1999.;;""Using Polyhedra for a Wireless Roaming Call Management System,"" Polyhedra, Inc., (prior to May 20, 2000).;;Veritas Software Corporation webpage, 2000.",EXPIRED

In particular, multiple identifiers associated with a network device are retrieved from and used to identify the network device. Use of multiple identifiers provides fault tolerance and supports full modularity of hardware within a network device. Authenticating the identity of a network device through multiple identifiers allows for the possibility that hardware associated with one or more of the identifiers may be removed from the network device. For example, a network device may still be automatically authenticated even if more than one card within the device are removed as long as at least one card corresponding to an identifier being used for authentication is within the device during authentication. In addition, the present invention allows for dynamic authentication, that is, the NMS is able to update its records, including the identifiers, over time as cards (or other hardware) within network devices are removed and replaced.",CIENA CORP,BRANSCOMB BRIAN;;BLACK DARRYL;;PERRY JAMES R,EQUIPE COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (2000-11-07);;CIENA CORPORATION (2004-12-10),https://lens.org/147-437-229-730-080,Granted Patent,yes,30,549,1,50,0,G06F11/2097;;H04L41/085;;H04L63/08;;H04L63/0876;;H04L61/4541;;H04L2101/677;;H04L41/085;;H04L41/12;;G06F11/2097;;H04L63/08;;H04L63/0876;;H04L61/4541;;H04L2101/677,G06F17/30,726/9;;726/6;;726/5,23,3,127-381-124-510-502;;008-133-718-744-149;;105-707-389-220-753,10.1109/icce.2006.1598330;;10.1109/49.17700;;10.1109/icniconsmcl.2006.152,"""NetLinker FAQ"", Apr. 3, 1999,[Retrieved from Internet Jun. 9, 2004], ""http://www.netlinker.net/nlanswer/nl10.html"".;;""TCP/IP Network Concepts"", 1997, [Reteived from Internet Jun. 9, 2004], ""http://proxyfaq.networkgods.com/prxdocs/htm/prenet.htm"".;;Secure Remote USIM (Universal Subscriber Identity Module) Card Application Management Protocol for W-CDMA Networks Jae Hyung Joo; Jeong-Jun Suh; Young Yong Kim; Consumer Electronics, 2006.

Through profiles, users may be given controlled access to configure network devices, provision services or simply view the network devices, services or portions thereof. For example, customers may be enabled to view services dedicated to their particular networks while being simultaneously prevented from viewing services particular to other customer's networks. This provides security while enabling controlled customer network management. In addition, profiles may be used to limit the management capabilities of network managers to only those network devices and capabilities for which each network manager is responsible and authorized.

At least a portion of a user's management information is stored in a team session file that is accessible by a network management system (NMS) client. For example, the team session file may be saved in memory that is local to the NMS client or, if a user logs in through a remote system using a web browser, the team session file may be saved as a cookie in memory local to the remote system. The NMS client may then utilize the user management information in the team session file while the user is logged into the NMS client. In one embodiment, the user management information stored within the team session file includes NMS server connection information. Thus, when a user logs into an NMS client, the NMS client uses the NMS server connection information to connect to an NMS server. The user management information stored within the team session file may be retrieved from user profile information corresponding to the user and stored in a central data repository, and since the user profile data is stored in a central repository, changes may be easily made to the user profile data and consequently pushed out to the team session files accessible by one or more NMS clients.

   The present invention provides a method and apparatus for improving management and network availability by providing out-of-band management channels between network/element management system (NMS) clients and servers. High priority client requests and server notifications may be sent over the out-of-band management channels to ensure fast response times. In addition, periodic roll calls between NMS clients and NMS servers may be executed over the out-of-band management channels to allow for quick discovery of any disconnects and reclaiming associated client resources. Further, periodic roll calls may be conducted between the NMS servers and the network devices to which they are connected, and if a server discovers that a network device has gone down, it may send a high priority notification to appropriate NMS clients over the out-of-band management channels to ensure a fast response by the clients. Sending high priority messages over out-of-band management channels maximizes client/server management availability and, hence, network availability.

    An autonomous stratospheric airship comprising a hull which contains an equipment bay, forward and aft ballonets, forward and aft air management sub-systems, a propulsion system, and a control system is described. The airship also comprises a regenerative solar energy power and storage sub-system which allows powered daytime and nighttime operations. Further, the control system of the airship enables autonomous operation between selected waypoints or along a specified line of sight. The solar arrays utilized by the airship are internally mounted and gimballed so as to provide maximum collection efficiency and not impede the aerodynamic profile of the airship. A greatly simplified and slightly less controllable version of the airship, which makes use of alternative solar array control and ballast management systems, while carrying the equipment bay on the exterior of the hull, is also disclosed.
