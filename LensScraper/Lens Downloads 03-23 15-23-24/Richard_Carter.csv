Jan. 28 Acetylene.-The generator consists of a double walled tank B<11>, C"" forming an annular water space ; a cylinder E open at top and bottom and divided by a perforated diaphragm into a carbide chamber G above and a lime pit H below ; and a removable bell D. The carbide is agitated, when necessary, by the stirring-apparatus shown, and the water is distributed over it by a perforated diaphragm J. In a modification described, the diaphragm F is hemispherical or semi-cylindrical, and the axis of the stirring-device is horizontal. The diaphragm J may also be replaced by a suitable distributing- nozzle. The gas passes into a counterbalanced bell gas holder B. The supply of water is controlled by the bell M' through a weighted lever H<1> connected by a cord with a valve P in the chamber C. This chamber and its branches A', B' are filled from a cistern R through a cock S of small aperture and the amount of water contained in it is regulated by the height of the adjustable pipe D' in the branch A'. When the valve P is closed and the chamber C fills, a float C<1> in the branch B' is raised, and the lever T connected with it by a cord is allowed to fall and close the cock S. When the valve P is opened the chamber C is emptied, the float C' falls, and the cock S is thereby opened again. To prevent too great a supply of water passing to the generator, in consequence of the valve P leaking, the pipe Q is provided with a flexible joint E', and the lower end of the pipe is connected by a cord F<1> with the bell M'.

ASSOCIATED ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES Ltd. Aug. 26, 1964 [July 29, 1963], No. 29975/63. Heading H3T. [Also in Division H2] An oscillator for controlling thyristors, thyratrons, ignitrons or mercury-arc rectifiers is itself controlled by a waveform comprising a sawtooth wave with impulses superimposed on the peaks. In Fig. 3, a sawtooth wave is produced from an A.C. supply by R.C. circuit 6, 7 and diodes 1, 2, 3. The peak of this wave will occur around the point where the A.C. supply crosses zero, and the base of transistor 9 will then become sufficiently negative for the transistor to conduct. When this happens, a surge of current flows through diode 13 and charges capacitor 11 to the supply voltage. When the sawtooth wave returns to its initial point, transistor 9 is cut off and capacitor 11 discharges through the low resistances 10, 12, the diode 13 now being reverse biased. When the diode voltage decreases to a certain value, transistor 9 will again conduct for a short time. The impulses so produced occur slightly before the A.C. crossover point by the action of capacitor 7. The transistor 9 may be of the NPN type or can be replaced by a valve. The oscillator 17 can be a pulse-generator or a bi-stable circuit, e.g. a Schmitt trigger. The abovedescribed circuit is an auxiliary to the normal control signals applied via T4 and ensures that the oscillator will not remain in the wrong state if the control signals drift to too low a value.",ASS ELECT IND,CARTER RICHARD MALCOLM,,https://lens.org/043-788-583-743-179,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H02M7/1555,H02M7/155,H2F FSF           F(3A+9B2);;H2F FSX           FSX;;H2F F15           -;;H2F F3A           -;;H2F F3S1          -;;H2F F9B2          -;;H2F F9K2          -;;H2F F9N1B1        -;;H2F F9N2A         -;;H2F F9S1          -;;H2F F9T1          -;;H3T TLBX          TLBX;;H3T TLX           TLX;;H3T T1CX          -;;H3T T1LX          -;;H3T T1L1          -;;H3T T2A1N         -;;H3T T2A1S         -;;H3T T2B2          -;;H3T T2F2          -;;H3T T2F5          -;;H3T T2T3J         -;;H3T T2T3TX        -;;H3T T2W2          -;;H3T T2W3          -;;H3T T3F1          -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

In operation, when the bell Q of the holder descends a weight I' is liberated, and the lever U, to which it is connected by the cord H<1>, is raised between its adjustable stops V. The tip-tank is thus tilted so that some water runs out from its rear spout into the tank S, and thence to the generator. When the bell Q rises again, the pipe F<1>, which is hinged at i, is raised to prevent more water from running into the generator, and then the tank T is tilted back by the raising of the weight I<1>. Any leakage from the cock D<1> overflows from the tank T by the front spout, clear of the tank S.

When it is desired to use the boat, the envelope can be retracted to an unobtrusive position in which it occupies little space and its exposure to marine currents is minimal. Retraction and deployment is effected by folding a frame or support on which the envelope is mounted, and/or the envelope itself. During storage of the boat within the envelope, the entrapped water is tested by a probe and the amount of treatment agent needed to neutralise the marine life is determined. This precise amount is added to the entrapped water, whereby the latter is rendered neutral with respect to the hull and is likewise harmless environmentally when released upon retraction of the envelope.

CARTER & CO. Ltd. Aug. 23, 1961 [July 23, 1960], No. 25729/60. Class 74 (2). A braiding machine bobbin 19 of the ratchet let-off type has a ratchet base 15 connected to one of its flanges 12 by a resilient connection 14. As shown, an annular resilient disc 14, e.g. of rubber, is bonded to flange 12 and disc 15a which latter has teeth 15b. Alternatively, compression springs may be provided instead of disc 14. Flanges 11, 12 secured by pins 13b, to a sleeve 13, of which a reduced portion 13a projects through flange 12 form bobbin 19 which is located on a spindle 16 by a sleeve 21. The ends of a latch 18a pivoted on sleeve 21 respectively engage teeth 15b and the end of a spring- biased rod 18b. Two parallel pillars.22 on a base-plate 17 each carry a compression spring 20b which extends between a block 20a sliding on the pillars and a web 23 carrying a guide 24 and a support 23a for the end of spindle 16. Parallel pulleys 25 and 26 are secured respectively to block 20a and a fixed lug 18d. A cam follower assembly 28 secured beneath plate 17 engages a cam slot of a braiding machine. In operation, a wire from bobbin 19 passes round pulleys 26 and 25 and through guide 24 to the cable being braided. Any increase of tension in the wire will draw the pulley 25 axially of pillars 22 until block 20a engages member 18c and displaces rod 18b to disengage latch 18a from ratchet teeth 15b and allow the bobbin to rotate freely to reduce the tension. Block 20a then moves downward, rod 18b returns to its initial position and latch 18a re-engages teeth 15b to brake the bobbin's rotation.",B & F CARTER & COMPANY LTD,CARTER BEN RICHARD,,https://lens.org/147-655-771-624-136,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,D04C3/14,D04C3/14,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A described embodiment provides for evaluating each possible subunit sequence of a biopolymer with respect to a mass spectrum produced by ionizing and fragmenting the mass-tagged biopolymer in order to determine the most probable subunit sequence of the biopolymer. However, unlike in the currently practiced, permutations-based methods, an efficient combinations-based search is used to hierarchically partition all possible subunit sequences, and to assign maximum subunit-sequence rankings to the partitions, in order to computationally efficiently extract the most probable subunit sequence.

[Also in Division B5] A filter element of sintered polytetrafluoroethylene incorporates an integral reinforcing element, either at or near its surface or well embedded, which does not contribute to filtration. The reinforcement may be a random mat, woven natural or synthetic textiles, glass or silica fibres, wire coated with plastics or glass, woven or welded mesh of stainless steel. When the reinforcement is near the surface it may be pressed hot into the sintered plastic, applied cold and bonded by subsequent heating or pressed into the plastic which is first softened by solvent. Or a reinforcement is placed in a mould and the PTFE powder sintered around it, to make an element of the well embedded kind. Fig. I (not shown) illustrates a prior art filter tube, reinforced by a separate internal stainless steel helix, coated with P.T.F.E., the end of the tube being clamped between two parts of an adaptor.

Once the safety feature is activated, positive or negative pressure in the barrel to draw out medication is defeated. The retracting needle safety feature requires only an increase of force along the same line of action as the injection stroke. This allows for safe, one-handed injection, which is critical in some situations. The retracting needle syringe of the present invention also minimizes the amount of wasted medication because the plunger rod incorporates a plunger tip that occupies the entire volume inside the barrel. Because the retracting needle syringe uses standard luer-lok fittings, it can be used with a variety of standard needles that do not have retracting cannula. This gives the healthcare professional or patient the ability to use a large gauge needle to fill the syringe from a vial or other container before attaching the safety needle for injection. Lastly, the plunger can be completely encapsulated by the barrel upon activation of the retracting needle syringe safety feature which will prevent re-use of the syringe and allow for safe and easy disposal.",BECTON DICKINSON CO,CARTER J;;CAIZZA RICHARD,,https://lens.org/092-518-713-678-246,Granted Patent,no,0,0,19,19,0,A61M5/3234;;A61M5/347;;A61M5/502;;A61M5/508;;A61M5/3234;;A61M5/502;;A61M5/508;;A61M5/347,A61M5/178;;A61M5/32;;A61M5/34;;A61M5/50,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

This can lead to peak voltages of nearly double the power signal appearing at the motor terminals. A termination network 1 is provided for connection to the supply to an AC motor 2 which includes a bridge rectifier 6-11 having AC inputs 3, 4, 5 connected to the motor supply and a DC output connected to a low impedance source at a similar voltage to the nominal motor operating voltage. By providing such a termination network, when an edge appears at the motor terminals 3, 4, 5, the energy in the cable is transferred into the low impedance source rather than appearing as an overshoot.

Once the safety feature is activated, positive or negative pressure in the barrel to draw out medication is defeated. The retracting needle safety feature requires only an increase of force along the same line of action as the injection stroke. This allows for safe, one-handed injection, which is critical in some situations. The retracting needle syringe of the present invention also minimizes the amount of wasted medication because the plunger rod incorporates a plunger tip that occupies the entire volume inside the barrel. Because the retracting needle syringe uses standard luer-lok fittings, it can be used with a variety of standard needles that do not have retracting cannula. This gives the healthcare professional or patient the ability to use a large gauge needle to fill the syringe from a vial or other container before attaching the safety needle for injection. Lastly, the plunger can be completely encapsulated by the barrel upon activation of the retracting needle syringe safety feature which will prevent re-use of the syringe and allow for safe and easy disposal.",BECTON DICKINSON CO,CARTER J;;CAIZZA RICHARD,,https://lens.org/024-499-566-404-298,Granted Patent,no,0,0,19,19,0,A61M5/3234;;A61M5/347;;A61M5/502;;A61M5/508;;A61M5/3234;;A61M5/502;;A61M5/508;;A61M5/347,A61M5/178;;A61M5/32;;A61M5/34;;A61M5/50,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The TLB includes a memory organized as N TLB entries, each entry having an entry space tag, a virtual tag, a valid bit, and a physical page number. A comparator is coupled to each entry which compares only the TLB index to the virtual tag. Each TLB entry further includes a matching bit memory for pre-storing the results of comparing the contents of the entry space tag with the contents (indirect address) of the space registers. The contents of the matching bit memories are then selected during the memory translation process to indicate the result of the prior comparison.

Automatic speed control. ASSOCIATED ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES Ltd. Sept. 3, 1963 [Sept. 3, 1962], No.33703/62. Heading G3R. [Also in Division H2] In a circuit in which a load, e.g. a motor as shown, is controlled by adjustment of the firing angle of a semi-conductor controlled rectifier 3, the triggering voltage is derived from a potentiometer 7, shunted by a smoothing capacitor 10, in series with a rectifier 9 across the A.C. supply. The potential at the trigger electrode is stated to be A.C. with a superimposed variable D.C., and an RC network 11, 12 produces a 90 degrees phase lag. The voltage between the cathode and trigger electrodes of 3 is limited by a Zener diode 14 and the inverse voltage across the controlled rectifier 3 is reduced by a further rectifier 6 which also rectifies the supply for field 2. Additional rectifiers 15, 16 provide short circuit paths during non- conducting half-cycles. The motor runs at constant speed since its back e.m.f. is balanced against the trigger voltage.",ASS ELECT IND,BABAD LEON;;CARTER RICHARD MALCOLM,,https://lens.org/062-426-502-615-265,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H02P7/295,H02P7/295,G3R RA625         BN34;;G3R RBN34         BN34;;G3R RB393         BN34;;G3R RB424         BN34;;G3R R112A         -;;G3R R33D2P        R33D;;G3R R4            -;;G3R R71           R33D;;G3R R73           R33D;;G3R R8W           -;;G3R R9L           -;;H2J JCD           JCD;;H2J JSVV          JSVV;;H2J J12D          -;;H2J J12H2         -;;H2J J12NX         J2G6;;H2J J2GX          -;;H2J J2G6B         J2G6;;H2J J2G6CY        J2G6;;H2J J2G6C1        J2G6;;H2J J2J3          J2G6,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The retracting needle safety feature requires only an increase of force along the same line of action as the injection stroke.

Because the retracting needle syringe uses standard luer-lok fittings, it can be used with a variety of standard needles that do not have retracting cannula. This gives the healthcare professional or patient the ability to use a large gauge needle to fill the syringe from a vial or other container before attaching the safety needle for injection.

Once the safety feature is activated, positive or negative pressure in the barrel to draw out medication is defeated. The retracting needle safety feature requires only an increase of force along the same line of action as the injection stroke. This allows for safe, one-handed injection, which is critical in some situations. The retracting needle syringe of the present invention also minimizes the amount of wasted medication because the plunger rod incorporates a plunger tip that occupies the entire volume inside the barrel. Because the retracting needle syringe uses standard luer-lok fittings, it can be used with a variety of standard needles that do not have retracting cannula. This gives the healthcare professional or patient the ability to use a large gauge needle to fill the syringe from a vial or other container before attaching the safety needle for injection. Lastly, the plunger can be completely encapsulated by the barrel upon activation of the retracting needle syringe safety feature which will prevent re-use of the syringe and allow for safe and easy disposal.",BECTON DICKINSON CO,CARTER MICHAEL J;;CAIZZA RICHARD,,https://lens.org/111-482-359-518-738,Patent Application,yes,0,0,19,19,0,A61M5/3234;;A61M5/347;;A61M5/502;;A61M5/508;;A61M5/3234;;A61M5/502;;A61M5/508;;A61M5/347,A61M5/178;;A61M5/32;;A61M5/34;;A61M5/50,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Once the safety feature is activated, positive or negative pressure in the barrel to draw out medication is defeated. The retracting needle safety feature requires only an increase of force along the same line of action as the injection stroke. This allows for safe, one-handed injection, which is critical in some situations. The retracting needle syringe of the present invention also minimizes the amount of wasted medication because the plunger rod incorporates a plunger tip that occupies the entire volume inside the barrel. Because the retracting needle syringe uses standard luer-lok fittings, it can be used with a variety of standard needles that do not have retracting cannula. This gives the healthcare professional or patient the ability to use a large gauge needle to fill the syringe from a vial or other container before attaching the safety needle for injection. Lastly, the plunger can be completely encapsulated by the barrel upon activation of the retracting needle syringe safety feature which will prevent re-use of the syringe and allow for safe and easy disposal.",BECTON DICKINSON CO,CARTER MICHAEL J;;CAIZZA RICHARD,,https://lens.org/195-118-127-550-217,Granted Patent,no,0,0,19,19,0,A61M5/3234;;A61M5/347;;A61M5/502;;A61M5/508;;A61M5/3234;;A61M5/502;;A61M5/508;;A61M5/347,A61M5/178;;A61M5/32;;A61M5/34;;A61M5/50,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The view from the video cameras is displayed on a touch screen 60 which is used to input a desired destination. The control unit then formulates a best route and delivers both visual and audio steering cues via the screen 60 and the indicators 62 64. The inventive concept of this application relates to the provision of steering cues which incorporate a display having a proportional element to indicate the amount of steering required. As the user manoeuvres the vehicle, the digital map and relative position of the vehicle are continually updated and steering correction cues are delivered at appropriate points via the interface.

The body 4 can slide axially when the body is in one rotational position relative to the bush and can be locked axially when the body is in another rotational position relative to the bush. A stop member 26 is slidable in the body 4 and biassed in one direction. The stop member 26 is formed with a lug 30 projecting through a slot 32 in the body 4 and into a slot 34 in the bush 16,16a.

Preferably the operation of this device occurs in a structural submerged depth of less than one-half wavelength of waves in the region. In a preferred embodiment, the flow through the central opening is bidirectional, and a self-rectifying turbine is used for unidirectional rotation. In an alternative embodiment, unidirectional check valves are used to direct water flow to a unidirectional turbine. Guide vanes are used to direct the flow inward towards the opening and can also be used to induce swirl in the flow field. When constructed axisymmetrically, the device can generate power from waves coming from any direction. The device may have multiple turbines arranged within it, or multiple units can be built into an array for power generation.

   The present invention is directed to the combined use of first and second fatty acid amides to improve the softness of a thermoplastic polymer construct. A combination of fatty acid amides is provided in the blend ratio of about 10 to 90 percent by weight of a first fatty acid amide and 90 to 10 percent by weight of a second fatty acid amide. The first and second fatty acid amides are compounded into a thermoplastic polymer carrier resin and, preferentially, produced as concentrate pellets containing 0.5 to 75 percent by weight total fatty acid amide loading. The concentrate pellets are introduced into a thermoplastic polymer base, to form a thermoplastic resin, at a letdown level in the range of about 1 to 15 percent, with the range of 2 to 10 percent being preferred, and the range of 3 to 6 percent being most preferred.

There may be at least three horizontally-spaced transparent covers on one instrument panel, wherein at least one of the covers is an inboard cover and at least two covers are outboard covers, one outboard cover on one side of the inboard cover and the other outboard cover being on the other side of the inboard cover.

    Pipelines are controlled by specifying operations along them. Control specifies sequential control values defining operations at each station to control the pipeline state. The time-dependent state is determinable by software calculations using continuous measurements along the pipeline. Forecasted deliveries dictate that the current pipeline state must change by future time (T). Control sequences are determined at pipeline stations to exercise optimum pipeline control while achieving predetermined goals from the current state to a sustainable target state which supports future deliveries by simulating current pipeline states through time interval T, while satisfying time-dependent forecast deliveries. An initial computable control set is iteratively improved and evaluated by computing the gradient of pipeline operational cost, costs of missing target(s), and costs of violating constraints by solving an adjoint problem each time the simulation is made. The gradient information, using second-order approximations to the N-dimensional cost, rapidly produces optimizing solutions using an accelerated iteration.

    A method and apparatus for deriving characteristics of a utility signal for synchronizing the output of a motor drive with the utility for a transfer or capture operation. With the drive in idle, the voltage and phase angle of an input to the drive are detected by instrumentation of the drive. The voltage and phase angle of a signal from a utility are detected by instrumentation of the drive at the output of the drive. A phase angle difference and scaling factor are determined to correlate the input signal to the motor drive with the signal at the output of the motor drive. The phase angle difference and scaling factor are stored and subsequently used to derive the signal at the motor due to the utility at the time of the transfer or capture procedure.
