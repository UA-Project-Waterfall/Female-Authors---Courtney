    A system, method and article of manufacture are provided for conveying redundancies and omissions among components of a network framework such as a web architecture framework. First, an area of an existing network framework is determined in which redundancies and omissions exist. Next, a pictorial representation of the existing network framework is presented along with a plurality of its components. The foregoing redundancies and the omissions are then highlighted by indicia coding the components of the existing network that reside in the area. As such, a diagnostic analysis of redundant efforts and gaps in a current implementation of the existing network framework is effectively conveyed.
