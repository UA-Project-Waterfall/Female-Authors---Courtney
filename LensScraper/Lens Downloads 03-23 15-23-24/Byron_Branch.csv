Each rod extends perpendicular to the front face of the frame and is positioned horizontally and vertically so as to distribute the weight of the cotton module evenly across each rod and throughout the cotton module itself. The number and width of the rods allow for penetration of the cotton module without substantially disturbing the seed cotton integrity. Mounting brackets for either a three-point hitch or a front-end loader extend from the rear face of the frame.,SMALL BYRON;;BRANCH RANDY;;R AND A BRANCH FARM;;SMALL INC,SMALL BYRON;;BRANCH RANDY,R AND A BRANCH FARMS (2011-02-15);;SMALL INC (2011-02-15),https://lens.org/129-226-468-584-997,Patent Application,yes,0,2,2,2,0,A01D87/122;;A01D87/122,A01D87/12;;B66F9/12,294/61,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
