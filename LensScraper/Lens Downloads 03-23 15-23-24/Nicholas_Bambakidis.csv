Allows ease of use while promoting both immediate spinal stability and eventual arthrodesis. May be utilized during anterior or retroperitoneal approaches to the spinal column, primarily addressing anterior spinal column pathology. May utilize fusion augmenting material of limited biomechanical strength compared to the strength of its rigid components. May be accompanied by additional anterior or posterior spinal instrumentation and fixation. Uses a pair of circular endplate discs that are distracted from each other by ribs of rigid support rods. Extension may be performed using an expansion tool once device is placed within intervertebral space. Hollow portions of device may be packed with bone or other materials to enhance eventual fusion. Shape of discs at each end may be manipulated prior to surgery to adapt to the specific spinal curvature desired.",BAMBAKIDIS NICHOLAS,BAMBAKIDIS NICHOLAS,,https://lens.org/007-494-705-121-265,Patent Application,yes,22,69,1,1,0,A61F2/44;;A61F2/44;;A61B2017/0256;;A61B2017/0256;;A61F2/30744;;A61F2/30744;;A61F2/4465;;A61F2/4465;;A61F2/4611;;A61F2/4611;;A61F2002/2835;;A61F2002/2835;;A61F2002/30235;;A61F2002/30235;;A61F2002/30383;;A61F2002/30383;;A61F2002/30517;;A61F2002/30517;;A61F2002/3052;;A61F2002/3052;;A61F2002/3055;;A61F2002/3055;;A61F2002/30601;;A61F2002/30601;;A61F2002/30772;;A61F2002/30772;;A61F2002/30841;;A61F2002/30841;;A61F2002/30879;;A61F2002/30879;;A61F2002/4622;;A61F2002/4622;;A61F2002/4628;;A61F2002/4628;;A61F2220/0025;;A61F2220/0025;;A61F2230/0069;;A61F2230/0069,A61F2/44,623/17.11,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
