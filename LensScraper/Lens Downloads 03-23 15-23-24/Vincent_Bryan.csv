   The invention relates to a surgical implant that provides an artificial diarthroidal-like joint, suitable for use in replacing any joint, but particularly suitable for use as an intervertebral disc endoprosthesis. The invention contains two rigid opposing shells, each having an outer surface adapted to engage the surfaces of the bones of a joint in such a way that the shells are immobilized by friction between their outer surfaces and the surfaces of the bone. These outer surfaces are sufficiently rough that large frictional forces strongly resist any slippage between the outer surface and the bone surfaces in the joint. They may be convex, and when inserted into a milled concavity, are immediately mechanically stable. Desirably, the outer surfaces of the shells are adapted to allow for bony ingrowth, which further stabilizes the shells in place. The inner surfaces of the shells are relatively smooth, and adapted to slide easily across a portion of the outer surface of a central body disposed between the shells. The central body has a shape that cooperates with the shape of the inner surface of the shell so as to provide a range of motion similar to that provided by a healthy joint. A flexible sheath extends between edges of the opposing shells. The inner surface of this sheath, together with the inner surfaces of the rigid shells, defines a cavity encasing the central body. At least a portion of this cavity is filled with a fluid lubricant, further decreasing the frictional force between inner surfaces of the shell and the surface of the central body.

   The invention relates to a spinal disc endoprosthesis. The endoprosthesis has a resilient body formed of one or more materials which may vary in stiffness from a relatively stiff exterior annular gasket portion to a relatively supple central nucleus portion. Concaval-convex elements at least partly surround that nucleus portion so as to retain the nucleus portion and gasket between adjacent vertebral bodies in a patient's spine. Assemblies of endoprosthetic discs, endoprosthetic vertebral bodies, and endoprosthetic longitudinal ligaments may be constructed. To implant this endoprosthesis assembly, information is obtained regarding the size, shape, and nature of a patient's damaged spine. Thereafter, one or more prosthetic vertebral bodies and disc units are constructed in conformity with that information. Finally, the completed and conformed vertebral body and disc assembly is implanted in the patient's spine.

The endoprosthesis has a resilient body formed of one or more materials which may vary in stiffness from a relatively stiff exterior annular gasket portion to a relatively supple central nucleus portion. Concaval-convex elements at least partly surround that nucleus portion so as to retain the nucleus portion and gasket between adjacent vertebral bodies in a patient's spine. Assemblies of endoprosthetic discs, endoprosthetic vertebral bodies, and endoprosthetic longitudinal ligaments may be constructed. To implant this endoprosthesis assembly, information is obtained regarding the size, shape, and nature of a patient's damaged spine. Thereafter, one or more prosthetic vertebral bodies and disc units are constructed in conformity with that information. Finally, the completed and conformed vertebral body and disc assembly is implanted in the patient's spine.",WARSAW ORTHOPEDIC INC,BRYAN VINCENT;;KUNZLER ALEX,,https://lens.org/104-062-289-079-797,Amended Patent,yes,135,33,19,19,0,A61B17/686;;A61B17/7059;;A61B17/86;;A61B2017/00004;;A61F2/08;;A61F2/30742;;A61F2/30771;;A61F2/44;;A61F2/442;;A61F2/4425;;A61F2002/30016;;A61F2002/30069;;A61F2002/30113;;A61F2002/30168;;A61F2002/302;;A61F2002/30214;;A61F2002/30235;;A61F2002/30253;;A61F2002/30405;;A61F2002/30433;;A61F2002/30448;;A61F2002/30451;;A61F2002/30461;;A61F2002/30469;;A61F2002/30474;;A61F2002/30487;;A61F2002/30495;;A61F2002/30507;;A61F2002/30563;;A61F2002/30576;;A61F2002/30578;;A61F2002/30579;;A61F2002/30594;;A61F2002/30599;;A61F2002/30624;;A61F2002/30663;;A61F2002/30772;;A61F2002/30785;;A61F2002/443;;A61F2002/449;;A61F2220/0025;;A61F2220/0033;;A61F2220/0041;;A61F2220/005;;A61F2220/0058;;A61F2220/0075;;A61F2230/0006;;A61F2230/0043;;A61F2230/0065;;A61F2230/0067;;A61F2230/0069;;A61F2230/0076;;A61F2250/0019;;A61F2250/0063;;A61F2310/00023;;A61F2310/00029;;Y10S606/907;;Y10S606/91;;A61F2002/30462;;A61F2002/30331;;A61F2/30742;;A61F2002/30433;;A61B17/7059;;A61F2002/30469;;A61F2220/0058;;A61F2002/30624;;A61F2002/30785;;A61F2230/0069;;A61F2310/00029;;A61F2002/30461;;A61F2002/443;;A61F2/08;;A61F2002/30214;;A61F2002/30507;;A61F2002/30599;;A61B17/686;;A61F2230/0076;;A61B17/86;;A61F2/30771;;A61F2230/0006;;A61F2002/30253;;A61F2220/0025;;A61F2230/0065;;A61F2/44;;A61F2002/30448;;A61F2/442;;A61F2002/30069;;A61F2002/30235;;A61F2250/0019;;A61F2/4425;;A61F2002/30495;;A61F2002/30563;;A61F2002/30576;;A61F2002/30663;;A61F2220/0033;;A61F2220/0075;;A61F2002/30113;;A61F2230/0043;;A61F2002/30451;;A61F2002/30579;;A61F2002/30594;;A61F2002/302;;A61F2002/30772;;A61F2002/449;;A61F2310/00023;;A61F2002/30168;;A61F2230/0067;;A61F2220/0041;;A61F2002/30487;;A61F2220/005;;A61F2002/30405;;A61F2002/30578;;A61B2017/00004;;A61F2002/30474;;A61F2002/30016;;A61F2250/0063;;Y10S606/91;;Y10S606/907;;A61F2002/30331;;A61F2002/30462,A61F2/44;;A61B17/00;;A61B17/68;;A61B17/70;;A61B17/86;;A61F2/00;;A61F2/08;;A61F2/30,623/17.16;;623/17.11;;623/17.13;;606/247,26,15,058-080-126-560-685;;041-072-751-832-247;;008-595-785-824-727;;013-178-410-919-379;;080-559-578-634-499;;075-341-211-265-233;;014-496-568-295-682;;153-488-769-128-856;;019-579-253-365-311;;047-185-079-557-812;;032-245-966-849-704;;072-370-556-732-662;;000-467-204-351-427;;153-488-769-128-856;;065-062-030-130-706,10.1093/brain/24.4.532;;10.2106/00004623-196244080-00007;;14066179;;pmc1873933;;10.1136/bmj.2.5373.1607;;10.1093/brain/75.2.187;;14934989;;1840393;;10.1016/s1042-3680(18)30709-5;;10.1016/s1042-3680(18)30613-2;;8428146;;8367774;;10.1097/00007632-199306150-00017;;10.1097/00007632-199206001-00005;;10.1007/bf00268042;;2599689;;10.1097/00007632-199106001-00014;;1830704;;1862420;;10.1097/00007632-199106001-00015;;1908762;;2520083;;10.1097/00002517-198912000-00008;;10.1097/00024720-198912000-00008;;10.1097/00007632-199206001-00005;;1522735;;10.1115/1.2891403,"""The Ocurrence of Optic Neuritis in Lesions of the Spinal Cord, Injury, Tumor, Melitis;"" Taylor, Collier, Brain: A Journal of Neurology; vol. 24; MacMillian & Co.

The endoprosthesis has a resilient body formed of one or more materials which may vary in stiffness from a relatively stiff exterior annular gasket portion to a relatively supple central nucleus portion. Concaval-convex elements at least partly surround that nucleus portion so as to retain the nucleus portion and gasket between adjacent vertebral bodies in a patient's spine. Assemblies of endoprosthetic discs, endoprosthetic vertebral bodies, and endoprosthetic longitudinal ligaments may be constructed. To implant this endoprosthesis assembly, information is obtained regarding the size, shape, and nature of a patient's damaged spine. Thereafter, one or more prosthetic vertebral bodies and disc units are constructed in conformity with that information.

   A system for grasping, holding, stabilizing, and selectively releasing tissue with minimal damage to the tissue. The system can further include a device that signals entry into the epidural space. A tubular member is provided having at a distal tip an annular surface surrounding a terminal port and at least one barb projecting at an angle from the annular surface for grasping and controlling the tissue. Each barb is formed having a sharp edge configured to grasp the tissue as the tubular member is rotated about its longitudinal axis. One implementation of the system includes a plurality of unidirectional barbs spaced around the annular surface. The system can further include an indicator mechanism that gives a visual and a tactile indication of when the tubular member, such as a cannula, encounters and penetrates tissue.

Specifically, a wearable helmet or other wearable structure of the brain injury reduction system detects an impending collision and determines whether a protective measure is needed. If so, one or more actuation devices provides the protective measure to reduce venous drainage through one or both of the internal jugular veins or paravertebral venous plexus.

A sensing device of the system detects an impending or occurring event (e.g., collision or blast) in an environment surrounding the individual and sends information about the event to a controller of the system. The sensing device can be stationary or moves with the individual. Based on the information, the controller determines whether the event will likely cause brain injury to the individual. If so, the controller sends an instruction to an actuation device of the system to activate the protective measure. The actuation device uses transcutaneous electrodes to electrically simulate glottis closure and contraction of the abdominal musculature to induce a Valsalva-like maneuver. The Valsalva-like maneuver can increases the stiffness of the brain tissues in the intracranial compartment, and thus reduces the susceptibility of the brain tissues to deformation.

A sensing device of the system detects an impending or occurring event (e.g., collision or blast) in an environment surrounding the individual and sends information about the event to a controller of the system. The sensing device can be stationary or moves with the individual. Based on the information, the controller determines whether the event will likely cause brain injury to the individual. If so, the controller sends an instruction to an actuation device of the system to activate the protective measure.

The prosthesis includes a proximal humeral component having a platform disposed on an upper end. A tapered projection is disposed on the platform. A cup-shaped fracture cap having a tapered opening with generally the same shape as the tapered projection is removably disposable on the tapered projection. The fracture cap is shaped so as to allow for space between the cap and the glenold of a patient into whom the prosthesis is to be implanted and thereby allow the bones of the patient's humeral head to be reconstructed by reassembling and securing the bone fragments about the fracture cap. The prosthesis further includes a humeral head having a tapered opening which may be disposed on the proximal humeral component. The humeral head is interchangeable with the fracture cap. The prosthetic humeral head may be inserted into the patient's glenoid to replace the patient's natural humeral head in fracture cases where the natural humeral head is not viable, in arthritis cases where cartilage is degenerated, or where head fracture reconstruction is attempted but fails. The fracture cap and humeral head are both modular so as to as allow caps and heads of differing sizes to be disposed on the proximal humeral component. The prosthesis also includes a modular distal stem extension which may be secured and locked on the distal end of the proximal humeral component. The distal stem extension allows the overall length of the prosthesis to be selectively increased, thereby allowing the prosthesis to be fitted to patient's having humeral shafts of differing sizes.",KIRSCHNER MEDICAL CORP,CRAIG EDWARD VINCENT;;KYLE RICHARD FRANK;;STRAIGHT CHRISTOPHER BRYAN,BIOMET MANUFACTURING LLC (2013-06-03);;KIRSCHNER MEDICAL CORPORATION (1994-09-20);;BIOMET MANUFACTURING CORP (2007-05-18),https://lens.org/037-841-256-516-094,Granted Patent,yes,36,227,5,5,0,A61F2/4014;;A61F2/4014;;A61B17/06166;;A61B17/06166;;A61B17/86;;A61B17/86;;A61F2/30723;;A61F2/30723;;A61F2/30767;;A61F2/30767;;A61F2/40;;A61F2/40;;A61F2/4059;;A61F2/4059;;A61F2002/30332;;A61F2002/30332;;A61F2002/30339;;A61F2002/30339;;A61F2002/30405;;A61F2002/30405;;A61F2002/30433;;A61F2002/30433;;A61F2002/30461;;A61F2002/30461;;A61F2002/30474;;A61F2002/30474;;A61F2002/30574;;A61F2002/30574;;A61F2002/30594;;A61F2002/30594;;A61F2002/30604;;A61F2002/30604;;A61F2002/30616;;A61F2002/30616;;A61F2002/30772;;A61F2002/30772;;A61F2002/3082;;A61F2002/3082;;A61F2002/30884;;A61F2002/30884;;A61F2002/30902;;A61F2002/30902;;A61F2002/4018;;A61F2002/4018;;A61F2002/4029;;A61F2002/4029;;A61F2002/4037;;A61F2002/4037;;A61F2002/4044;;A61F2002/4044;;A61F2002/4051;;A61F2002/4051;;A61F2002/4062;;A61F2002/4062;;A61F2002/407;;A61F2002/407;;A61F2002/4077;;A61F2002/4077;;A61F2220/0025;;A61F2220/0025;;A61F2220/0033;;A61F2220/0033;;A61F2220/0041;;A61F2220/0041;;A61F2220/0075;;A61F2220/0075;;A61F2310/00023;;A61F2310/00023;;A61F2310/00029;;A61F2310/00029;;A61F2310/00203;;A61F2310/00203;;A61F2310/00239;;A61F2310/00239,A61B17/06;;A61B17/86;;A61F2/00;;A61F2/30;;A61F2/40,623/23,13,0,,,"True/Flex Humerus Rod System, Applied Osteo Systems, Inc. 1991.;;Russel Taylor Humeral Interlocking Nail System, Smith & Nephew Richards, Inc.;;Craig, Edward V., Prosthetic Replacement for Four Part Fractures of the Proximal Humerus, Operative Techniques in Shoulder Surgery, Ch. 27, pp. 187 196, 1991.;;Burkhead, Jr., Wayne Z., The Intermedics Select Shoulder System, Intermedics Orthopedics , Inc. 1992.;;Endotec Product Brochure, Buechel Pappas Femoral Stem System .;;Endotec Product Brochure, Buechel Pappas Total Shoulder System, Implants and Instruments.;;Endotec Product Brochure, Buechel Pappas Total Shoulder System, Surgical Procedure.;;Biomet Product Brochure, Bio Modular Total Shoulder, Biomet, Inc. 1989.;;Biomet Product Brochure, Bio Modular Total Shoulder, Surgical Technique, Biomet, Inc.;;Biomet Product Brochure, Uniflex Humeral Nail System, Biomet, Inc. 1991.;;Matsen, et al., Global Total Shoulder Arthroplasty System, DePuy, Inc.;;Product Brochure, The Intermedics Select Shoulder System, Intermedics Orthopedics , Inc.;;Craig, Edward V., Prosthetic Replacement for Four Part Fractures of the Proximal Humerus, in Operative Techniques in Shoulder Surgery, Lonnie E.

The invention contains two rigid opposing shells, each having an outer surface adapted to engage the surfaces of the bones of a joint in such a way that the shells are immobilized by friction between their outer surfaces and the surfaces of the bone. These outer surfaces are sufficiently rough that large frictional forces strongly resist any slippage between the outer surface and the bone surfaces in the joint. They may be convex, and when inserted into a milled concavity, are immediately mechanically stable. Desirably, the outer surfaces of the shells are adapted to allow for bony ingrowth, which further stabilizes the shells in place. The inner surfaces of the shells are relatively smooth, and adapted to slide easily across a portion of the outer surface of a central body disposed between the shells.

These outer surfaces are sufficiently rough that large frictional forces strongly resist any slippage between the outer surface and the bone surfaces in the joint. They may be convex, and when inserted into a milled concavity, are immediately mechanically stable. Desirably, the outer surfaces of the shells are adapted to allow for bony ingrowth, which further stabilizes the shells in place. The inner surfaces of the shells are relatively smooth, and adapted to slide easily across a portion of the outer surface of a central body disposed between the shells. The central body has a shape that cooperates with the shape of the inner surface of the shell so as to provide a range of motion similar to that provided by a healthy joint.

These outer surfaces are sufficiently rough that large frictional forces strongly resist any slippage between the outer surface and the bone surfaces in the joint. They may be convex, and when inserted into a milled concavity, are immediately mechanically stable. Desirably, the outer surfaces of the shells are adapted to allow for bony ingrowth, which further stablizes the shells in place. The inner surfaces of the shells are relatively smooth, and adapted to slide easily across a portion of the outer surface of a central body disposed between the shells. The central body has a shape that cooperates with the shape of the inner surface of the shell so as to provide a range of motion similar to that provided by a healthy joint. A flexible sheath extends between edges of the opposing shells. The inner surface of this sheath, together with the inner surfaces of the rigid shells, defines a cavity encasing the central body. At least a portion of this cavity is filled with a fluid lubricant, further decreasing the frictional force between inner surfaces of the shell and the surface of the central body.

   The invention relates to a surgical implant that provides an artificial diarthroidal-like joint, suitable for use in replacing any joint, but particularly suitable for use as an intervertebral disc endoprosthesis. The invention contains two rigid opposing shells, each having an outer surface adapted to engage the surfaces of the bones of a joint in such a way that the shells are immobilized by friction between their outer surfaces and the surfaces of the bone. These outer surfaces are sufficiently rough that large frictional forces strongly resist any slippage between the outer surface and the bone surfaces in the joint. They may be convex, and when inserted into a milled concavity, are immediately mechanically stable. Desirably, the outer surfaces of the shells are adapted to allow for bony ingrowth, which further stabilizes the shells in place. The inner surfaces of the shells are relatively smooth, and adapted to slide easily across a portion of the outer surface of a central body disposed between the shells. The central body has a shape that cooperates with the shape of the inner surface of the shell so as to provide a range of motion similar to that provided by a healthy joint. A flexible sheath extends between edges of the opposing shells. The inner surface of this sheath, together with the inner surfaces of the rigid shells, defines a cavity encasing the central body. At least a portion of this cavity is filled with a fluid lubricant, further decreasing the frictional force between inner surfaces of the shell and the surface of the central body.

   The invention relates to a technique for precisely locating a line containing a predetermined point within the surgical site using a series of levels and plumb lines and internal anatomical features of the surgical site, using this location to precisely position and temporarily affix a site preparation scaffold relative to the patient's anatomy so that site preparation instruments can be introduced into the site at precise locations governed by the scaffold geometry and patient anatomy. This precise positioning of the scaffold also provides a way for the surgeon to use patient anatomical features to reliably and precisely prepare the surgical site. Scaffolds having angling features further increase the precise preparation of the surgical site. This increased precision in site preparation increases the probability of a successful procedure, and decreases the likelihood that additional surgery may be needed.

The meteorological data acquisition stations are configured with two modes of meteorological data transmission, namely, via GSM network and satellite internet network. The priority mode of transmission is via GSM network while the secondary is satellite internet network in times of unavailable or weak signal from GSM network. When connected to the GSM network, the measured meteorological data is encoded in an SMS text message for transmission to a remote server. Otherwise, the measured meteorological data is encoded in a short data message for transmission via satellite internet network. The remote server receives and parses meteorological data from either of the SMS text message or short data message.
