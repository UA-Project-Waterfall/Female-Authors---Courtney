A first method for detecting blood in a biological sample involves applying asample to a first region of a test matrix, detecting globin or haemoglobin by means of an immunological test in a second region of the test matrix and detecting haem by means of a chromogen based test in a third region of the test matrix.

In one form, the device comprises: (1) a first opposable component comprising a sample preparation zone adapted to receive a sample to be assayed; (2) a second opposable component comprising a chromatographic medium; and (3) a conductive barrier attached to the second opposable component.

A first method for detecting blood in a biological sample involves applying a sample to a first region of a test matrix, detecting globin or haemoglobin by means of an immunological test in a second region of the test matrix and detecting haem by means of a chromogen based test in a third region of the test matrix. This method is capable of differentiating between upper and lower gastrointestinal tract bleeding and is useful for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal tract diseases, in particular, lower gastrointestinal tract diseases such as colorectal cancer. A second method disclosed involve s applying a sample to a first region of a test matrix, the sample is allowed to flow to a second region where it contacts a n anti-analyte immunointeractive molecule and a labelled anti-analyte immunointeractive conjugate.

In a push-pull deflection circuit, the deflection coils 5, 6 are connected in series with energy storage inductors 7, 8 in the output circuit of an amplifier 3, 4 having common-mode feedback from a point 14, an alternative common-mode feedback path 18 being switched in when fast symbols are to be displayed. As shown, deflection signals at terminal 1 are compared with a differential feedback signal from a differential amplifier 11 and passed by differential amplifier 2 to power transistors 3, 4, supplying push-pull deflection coils 5, 6. A transformer 7, 8 provides a boosted supply voltage. Common-mode feedback from the tapping 14 of resistors 12, 13 is compared with a reference voltage 15 in a differential amplifier 16, integrated at 17 and fed via a switching circuit 23 to amplifier 2. When fast symbols are to be displayed, feedback circuit 14, 16, 17 is replaced by a commonmode circuit from the tapping of resistors 19, 20 which is compared in amplifier 21 with a reference 22. Integrator 17 is then omitted. In Fig. 3 (not shown) the normal common-mode feedback is taken from the collector side of deflection coils 5, 6. Coils 7, 8 are replaced by a common coil (78).

In a preferred embodiment, there is an uninterrupted fluid supply comprised of a plurality of sterile solution saline bags (20) with an automatic spike (30) to perforate the bags. The system is processor (10) controlled with numerous safety and design features to automate arthroscopy to the highest degree possible. Some of the features include the monitoring and tracking of cavity pressure and flow rates to predetermined pressure and flow rates; tracking cavity to mean blood pressure, over pressure protection, a plurality of pressure; flow rate baseline settings, monitoring, setting and controlling saline supply; and specialized functions for providing pressure and flow rates for typical surgical procedures such as lavage, clear view, and burr/shaver. One or more vacuum discharge lines (68, 69) may be provided with an automatic selfcleaning feature. The system is compact and optionally employs a number of disposable components, including a novel fluid accumulator (46).
