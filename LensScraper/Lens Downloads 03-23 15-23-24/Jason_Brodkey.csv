The instrumentation includes an electrode assembly formed on/in a biocompatible substrate having a front surface, a back surface, a top edge and a bottom edge defining a height with a horizontal centerline, and opposing side edges defining a width greater than the height, the width being divided into right and left halves on either side of a vertical centerline. At least one first exposed electrode is disposed on the right half of the front surface, and at least one second exposed electrode is disposed on the left half of the front surface. The first and second electrodes are spaced apart by a distance of 1 centimeter or greater, preferably in the range of 1 to 3 centimeters. A pair of leads, one interconnected to a respective one of the first and second electrodes, protrude from the top or bottom edge of the substrate.",BRODKEY JASON A,BRODKEY JASON A,,https://lens.org/187-472-808-264-226,Patent Application,yes,4,29,1,1,0,A61N1/0553;;A61N1/0553;;A61N1/36071;;A61N1/36071,A61N1/05,607/46,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
