This method operates by dividing the circuit into a plurality of circuit modules, and defining a plurality of interface modules located between the plurality of circuit modules. These interface modules include drivers coupled between upstream circuit module outputs and downstream circuit module inputs, so as to isolate the downstream circuit module inputs from the upstream circuit module outputs. Next, the circuit modules and interface modules are designed, and a synthesized circuit is ultimately generated from the designs. This synthesized circuit is then verified for characteristics such as timing. If it fails to verify, design changes are made. In one embodiment, these design changes include: re-specifying constraints for modules, re-generating designs for modules, and re-dividing the circuit into modules. By locating drivers within separate interface modules, the drive strengths of the drivers can be more easily specified. Furthermore, by locating the drivers at particular positions within an interface module, the signals flowing through the drivers can be guided to flow in such a way as to route signals along shorter, more optimal pathways between modules.",MICRON TECHNOLOGY INC,BROWN JEFFREY R,MICRON ELECTRONICS INC (1998-01-07);;MICRON TECHNOLOGY INC (2001-06-06),https://lens.org/141-807-439-873-538,Granted Patent,yes,6,18,2,2,0,G06F30/30;;G06F30/30,G06F17/50,716/1;;716/2;;716/5,4,2,138-192-560-715-041;;119-665-966-680-852,10.1109/dac.1996.545671;;10.1109/cicc.1995.518181,"Sato et al Post Layout Optimization for Deep Submicron Design, ACM, Jan. 1996, pp. 1 6.;;Kannan et al A Methodology and Algorithm for Post Placement Delay Optimization, ACM 1994, pp. 327 332.;;Wiederhold et al Deep Submicron ASIC Design Requires Design Planning, EDN, Feb. 1995, pp. 95 100.;;Lillis et al, Optimal and Efficient Buffer Insertion and Wire Sizing, IEEE, 1995, pp. 259 262.",EXPIRED

    One embodiment of the present invention provides a method that supports multiple delayed read transactions between a host bus and a peripheral bus in a computer system. The method operates by receiving a first request that is a read operation from the host bus that is directed to the peripheral bus. The first request is stored in a first buffer and sent to the peripheral bus, so that the first request will be processed when the peripheral bus becomes available. Next, the system waits to receive a pipelined request that is a read operation from the host bus that is directed to the peripheral bus. If such a pipelined request is received, the system stores the pipelined request in a second buffer, and sends the pipelined request to the peripheral bus, so that the pipelined request will be processed when the peripheral bus becomes available. Next, the system issues a retry request across the host bus. This retry request causes both the first request and the pipelined request to be retried at a later time on the host bus so that the host bus can be freed up for other transactions while the first request and the pipelined request are in process on the peripheral bus. In one embodiment of the present invention, if the first request is a read operation that was previously requested, the system determines if read data from the previous request has been returned by the peripheral bus. If so, the system returns the read data across the host bus to complete the first request. Otherwise, the system issues a retry request across the host bus to cause the first request to be retried at a later time.

    A method and computer readable medium are provided for analyzing the integrity of a sensitivity list for a process statement in a hardware description language file. An example of a hardware description language to which the method can be applied is VHDL. The method compares an actual sensitivity list from a hardware description language file to an expected sensitivity list that includes one or more parameters expected to appear in the actual sensitivity list. In the event the actual sensitivity list deviates from the expected sensitivity list, the integrity of the actual sensitivity lists is compromised. In this case, an advisory can be generated to identify the deviation, and note its location within the hardware description language file. In this manner, the designer can quickly find the defective sensitivity list and correct it prior to simulation. A sensitivity list verification method can significantly reduce the time and effort involved in sensitivity list debugging. Consequently, the designer can devote more time and resources to the design effort and the end objective of producing the subject design. In many cases, reduction of debugging costs will bear significantly on the final cost of the design. At the same time, reduction of debugging time can shorten the design cycle.

These interface modules include drivers coupled between upstream circuit module outputs and downstream circuit module inputs, so as to isolate the downstream circuit module inputs from the upstream circuit module outputs. Next, the circuit modules and interface modules are designed, and a synthesized circuit is ultimately generated from the designs. This synthesized circuit is then verified for characteristics such as timing. If it fails to verify, design changes are made. In one embodiment, these design changes include: re-specifying constraints for modules, re-generating designs for modules, and re-dividing the circuit into modules. By locating drivers within separate interface modules, the drive strengths of the drivers can be more easily specified. Furthermore, by locating the drivers at particular positions within an interface module, the signals flowing through the drivers can be guided to flow in such a way as to route signals along shorter, more optimal pathways between modules.",MICRON TECHNOLOGY INC,BROWN JEFFREY R,,https://lens.org/012-920-309-290-104,Granted Patent,yes,8,16,2,2,0,G06F30/30;;G06F30/30,G06F17/50,716/1;;716/18,7,5,076-200-296-089-95X;;051-424-922-826-749;;030-444-585-285-668;;119-665-966-680-852;;138-192-560-715-041,10.1145/224818.224943;;10.1109/edtc.1996.494154;;10.1109/43.494706;;10.1109/cicc.1995.518181;;10.1109/dac.1996.545671,"Aoki et al, ""Fanout-Tree Restructuring Algorithm for Post-Placement Timing Optimization,"" IEEE, Sep. 1995, pp. 417-422.*;;Chen et al, ""An Algorithm for Zero-Skew Clock Tree Routing with Buffer Insertion,"" IEEE, Mar. 1996, pp. 230-236.*;;Tsai et al, ""Performance Driven Bus Buffer Insertion,"" IEEE, Apr. 1996, pp. 429-437.*;;Article entitled ""Deep-submicron ASIC design requires design planning"", by Bob Wiederhold, High Level Design Systems, EDN, Feb. 16, 1995.;;Article entitled ""Optimal and Efficient Buffer Insertion and Wire Sizing"".

According to the present invention, a management server transfers groups of directory objects from original directory servers to newly added directory servers without service interruption to users of the site. The directory objects are stored in categorical groups such that the directory objects in each group share an attribute. According to the present invention, certain groups in the original directory servers are identified for migration to the newly added servers based on a load-balancing scheme. In one embodiment, the identified groups are marked for migration to limit access to the directory objects therein. After successfully being migration, the groups are unmarked and access is resumed. In another embodiment, the management server includes a table storing location information that is updated to indicate successful transfer of the identified group of directory objects from the original server to the newly added server.",MICROSOFT CORP,PARHAM JEFFREY;;BROWN MARK,MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (2002-09-16),https://lens.org/114-896-593-727-430,Granted Patent,yes,14,4,2,2,0,H04L67/02;;H04L67/1023;;H04L69/329;;H04L61/4552;;H04L67/1001;;H04L69/329;;H04L67/02;;H04L67/1023;;H04L61/4552;;H04L67/1001,G06F15/16;;G06F15/173;;G06F17/30;;H04L29/06;;H04L29/08;;H04L29/12,709/226;;709/229,2,0,,,"Microsoft® Windows® Active Directory(TM) in the Outward-Facing Role (White Paper).

   A new method and framework for re-partitioning directory servers supporting user services in a site that receives access requests from users. According to the present invention, a management server transfers groups of directory objects from original directory servers to newly added directory servers without service interruption to users of the site. The directory objects are stored in categorical groups such that the directory objects in each group share an attribute. According to the present invention, certain groups in the original directory servers are identified for migration to the newly added servers based on a load-balancing scheme. In one embodiment, the identified groups are marked for migration to limit access to the directory objects therein. After successfully being migration, the groups are unmarked and access is resumed. In another embodiment, the management server includes a table storing location information that is updated to indicate successful transfer of the identified group of directory objects from the original server to the newly added server.

Alternatively, an agent with a known or established MAC address may be used to request a unique MAC address for the device from the server and to inform the server when the device no longer requires the requested MAC address. Also, instead of requesting a MAC address from a server acting as an address allocator and arbiter, the device instead may send a broadcast Ethernet packet with a broadcast source address having a payload indicating an intent to use a specific MAC address. If another device receiving this broadcast is already using the specific MAC address, then a broadcast packet is sent indicating a conflict with the device's intended address. In this case, the original device would send a new broadcast Ethernet packet with a payload indicating an intent to use a different specific MAC address. This process repeats until no response or assertion of use of the specific address in the payload is received by the original device. These techniques assure that dynamically addressable synthetic devices (such as virtual machines) and physical network devices do not attempt to use the same MAC address on the same network link.",MICROSOFT CORP,BROWN TAYLOR O;;KINSEY JEFFREY,MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (2005-09-27),https://lens.org/045-109-304-017-488,Patent Application,yes,27,85,2,2,0,H04L61/5092;;H04L2101/622;;H04L67/562;;H04L61/4511;;H04L61/5092;;H04L67/562;;H04L9/40;;H04L2101/622;;G06F9/5011,G06F15/173,709/226,1,1,131-565-129-240-91X,10.17487/rfc2855,"Fujisawa, 2000, DHCP FOR IEEE 1394, RFC 2855, Network Working Group",ACTIVE

Alternatively, an agent with a known or established MAC address may be used to request a unique MAC address for the device from the server and to inform the server when the device no longer requires the requested MAC address. Also, instead of requesting a MAC address from a server acting as an address allocator and arbiter, the device instead may send a broadcast Ethernet packet with a broadcast source address having a payload indicating an intent to use a specific MAC address. If another device receiving this broadcast is already using the specific MAC address, then a broadcast packet is sent indicating a conflict with the device's intended address. In this case, the original device would send a new broadcast Ethernet packet with a payload indicating an intent to use a different specific MAC address. This process repeats until no response or assertion of use of the specific address in the payload is received by the original device. These techniques assure that dynamically addressable synthetic devices (such as virtual machines) and physical network devices do not attempt to use the same MAC address on the same network link.",BROWN TAYLOR O;;KINSEY JEFFREY;;MICROSOFT CORP,BROWN TAYLOR O;;KINSEY JEFFREY,MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (2005-09-27),https://lens.org/121-179-663-902-014,Granted Patent,yes,27,7,2,2,0,H04L61/5092;;H04L2101/622;;H04L67/562;;H04L61/4511;;H04L61/5092;;H04L67/562;;H04L9/40;;H04L2101/622;;G06F9/5011,G06F9/46;;G06F15/16;;G06F9/50;;G06F15/173;;G06F15/177;;H04L29/06;;H04L29/08;;H04L29/12,709/245;;709/203;;709/220;;709/221;;709/222;;718/100;;718/104,4,2,051-591-891-412-508;;131-565-129-240-91X,10.17487/rfc2131;;10.17487/rfc2855,"R.

    A cooler and dispenser for use with upright water bottles operates to ( 1 ) pump chilled water from a vertical bottle through a top opening, ( 2 ) filter the air that is drawn in to replace the water, ( 3 ) and provide the user with an indication of the water level in the bottle. The dispenser cap is designed to fit snugly over the top of standard 3.0 and 5.0 gallon refillable water bottles in the vertical orientation. A small pump in the dispenser cap draws water from the bottom of the bottle and dispenses it through a tube that extends past the side of the bottle. The vacuum created within the bottle during the pumping process draws air in through a filter that keeps foreign particles from entering the bottle. Further, the airflow through the filter is constricted so as to ensure that a partial vacuum exists even after the pump has been turned off, and this draws residual water back through the delivery tube thereby preventing drips. The dispenser cap also contains a fluid level indicator that is connected to sensors mounted on the water draw tube.

Ions entering the mass filter are orthogonally accelerated by the orthogonal acceleration electrode 9 in a primary acceleration region 2 and enter a flight region 3. The ions 6,7,8 are then reflected by a reflectron 4 and are directed towards an exit region of the mass filter. Ions having a desired mass to charge ratio are arranged to arrive in the primary acceleration region 2 at a time when a voltage pulse applied to the orthogonal acceleration electrode 9 falls from a maximum to zero. Ions having a desired mass to charge ratio are orthogonally decelerated such that they have a zero component of velocity in the orthogonal direction. Accordingly, ions having a desired mass to charge ratio exit the mass filter in an axial direction. The mass filter also reduces the angular divergance of the entering ion beam.

Disclosed is a closed-loop feedback system for controlling the soft error rate (SER) due to radiation strikes on electronic circuitry. A variable sensitivity soft error rate detector provides and output corresponding to the soft error rate. This output is supplied to a voltage control. The output of the voltage control is fed back to the sensitivity control of the sensor-thus forming a feedback loop. The output of the voltage control may be the power supply of the soft error rate sensor. The output of the soft error rate sensor may also be used to enable and disable fault tolerant schemes or alert a user.,LSI CORP,TURNER MARK F;;BROWN JEFFREY S,AVAGO TECHNOLOGIES GENERAL IP (SINGAPORE) CORPORAT (2015-08-03),https://lens.org/148-969-718-837-122,Patent Application,no,5,3,12,12,0,G11C5/147;;G11C11/41;;G11C11/4125;;G11C29/52;;G11C2029/0409;;G11C2029/5002;;G11C11/4125;;G11C2029/5002;;G11C5/147;;G11C29/52;;G11C11/41;;G11C2029/0409,G11C29/42,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The dispenser cap is designed to fit snugly over the top of standard 3.0 and 5.0 gallon refillable water bottles in the vertical orientation. A small pump in the dispenser cap draws water from the bottom of the bottle and dispenses it through a tube that extends past the side of the bottle. The vacuum created within the bottle during the pumping process draws air in through a filter that keeps foreign particles from entering the bottle. Further, the airflow through the filter is constricted so as to ensure that a partial vacuum exists even after the pump has been turned off, and this draws residual water back through the delivery tube thereby preventing drips. The dispenser cap also contains a fluid level indicator that is connected to sensors mounted on the water draw tube.",HB INNOVATION LTD;;HARRISON HOWARD R;;BROWN JEFFREY R,HARRISON HOWARD R;;BROWN JEFFREY R,,https://lens.org/025-053-497-818-402,Search Report,yes,4,0,5,5,0,B05B9/0861;;B67D1/0004;;B67D1/0869;;B67D1/1247;;B05B9/002;;B05B11/0002;;B05B11/00444;;B05B11/1097;;B05B11/0002;;B67D1/0004;;B67D1/0869;;B67D1/1247;;B05B9/0861;;B05B9/002;;B05B11/00444;;B05B11/1097,B05B9/08;;B05B11/00;;B67D1/00;;B67D1/08;;B67D1/12,,0,0,,,,PENDING

    Disclosed is an improved hard macro design for use in an ASIC, which avoids undesirable buildup of electrostatic charge on a gate of an I/O transistor of the hard macro. The hard macro includes a port level metallic conductor of an I/O port positioned at a low level metalization layer and an electrical connection between the port level metallic conductor and a gate conductor of the I/O transistor. The electrical connection includes a first conducting section extending from the gate conductor to a top level metallic conductor at a highest level metalization layer and a second conducting section extending from the top level metallic conductor layer to the port level conductor. Antenna rule violations at the I/O port of the hard macro are eliminated due to the electrical connection between the top level metallic conductor and a diffusion region.

    A cooler and dispenser for use with upright water bottles operates to (1) pump chilled water from a vertical bottle through a top opening, (2) filter the air that is drawn in to replace the water, (3) and provide the user with an indication of the level in the bottle. The dispenser cap is designed to fit snugly over the top of standard 3.0 and 5.0 gallon refillable water bottles in the vertical orientation. A small pump in the dispenser cap draws water from the bottom of the bottle and dispenses it through a tube that extends past the side of the bottle. The vacuum created within the bottle during the pumping process draws air in through a filter that keeps foreign particles from entering the bottle. Further, the airflow through the filter is constricted so as to ensure that a partial vacuum exists even after the pump has been turned off, and this draws residual water back through the delivery tube thereby preventing drips. The dispenser cap also contains a fluid level indicator that is connected to sensors mounted on the water draw tube.

The method may transmit a snoop request to the cache memory concurrently with or after the memory request is transmitted to the system memory. The method may be implemented using a system controller having a control switch that uses a first pathway for the memory request and a second pathway for the snoop request so that the snoop and memory requests can be transmitted simultaneously.,MICRON ELECTRONICS INC,JEDDELOH JOSEPH;;MEYER JAMES;;BROWN JEFFREY R,MICRON ELECTRONICS INC (1997-12-22);;ROUND ROCK RESEARCH LLC (2009-12-23);;MICRON TECHNOLOGY INC (2000-03-17),https://lens.org/102-757-610-180-92X,Granted Patent,yes,12,32,1,1,0,G06F12/0831;;G06F12/0831,G06F12/08,711/146;;711/154;;711/168;;711/150;;711/169,1,0,,,"Shanley and Anderson, ISA System Architecture, Addison Wesley Publishing Co., 3 rd Ed., pp. 235 272, Feb. 1995.",EXPIRED

As illustrated the valve (18) may form part of a shower rose (42). The valve has a main body (820) with a flow channel through the main body. The main body receives water from upstream through an inlet port and passes it out through an outlet port at the downstream end of the body. A flow control assembly is located in the flow channel and includes a temperature sensor/actuator acting on a piston to move, when the temperature sensor heats up the piston, to block water flow control ports. The flow-control assembly also includes an override feature wherein the piston is located within a slide and the flow control ports are located in the slide. By moving the slide away from the piston when the piston is blocking the flow control ports, the temperature sensor and piston may be overridden and flow may resume through the main body.

    A filter cartridge for use in a filter system, in which the cartridge has no structural metal parts and is adapted for environmentally acceptable disposal. A pleated paper filter media is formed into a cylinder, and end caps at the axial ends of the cylinder hold the shape of the filter. Sealing gaskets are associated with the end caps. At least one side has a radial seal formed at the outer periphery of the filter cartridge to protect the associated end cap from higher a pressure region found at the outer periphery. The other axial end can have a similar radial filter in some applications, or in other applications, where flow at that end of the filter is not desired, can utilize an axial seal specially configured to protect the associated end cap from higher pressure at the outer periphery. Maintenance of lower pressure at the respective end caps places any axial loads on the filter in tension, and thereby prevents the application of axial crushing loads on the filter cartridge.

In a modification, the supersonic gas turbine jet propulsion nozzle comprises a fixed cylindrical casing 21 containing a bulbous plug 22 forming a throat 23. Plug 22 is axially movable between a position, shown in full lines, in which throat 23 is upstream of the downstream end of casing 21 to form a convergent-divergent nozzle and a position, shown dotted, in which throat 23 is at the downstream end of casing 21 to form a convergent nozzle. Plug 22 has an outer wall 24 and an inner wall 25 mounted about a tube 26 supported by struts 27 from casing 21. Axial movement of plug 22, running on balls 28 within axial tracks in tube 26, is effected by an electric motor 30 driving a shaft 31 splined to a sleeve 33 having an externally threaded portion 34 running on balls 36 within a fixed nut 35. An extension 41 of sleeve 33 is rotatably received in a cup member 43 secured to an internal wall 44 of the plug. A modified drive mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 5 (not shown). Plug 22 is provided with angularly spaced streamlined members 45 running on rollers 47, 48 within wall 24. Members 45 are pivotally linked to a sleeve 51 running on wall 25 and moved axially by rams 53. Thus movement of sleeve 51 causes radial movement of members 45 into the jet stream to reduce the flow area at throat 23.",ROLLS ROYCE,COLVILLE FRANCIS JEFFREY;;ROBERTS NORMAN;;BROWN DAVID MORRIS,,https://lens.org/075-548-547-330-631,Granted Patent,no,0,1,4,5,0,F02K1/08;;F02K1/085;;F02K1/09;;F02K1/42;;F02K1/46;;F02K1/46;;F02K1/09;;F02K1/42;;F02K1/085;;F02K1/08,F02K1/08;;F02K1/09;;F02K1/42;;F02K1/46,F1J J1A           -;;F1J J1F2A         -;;F1J J1F2C2        -;;F1J J1F2X         -;;F1J J1X           -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Positive analyte ions are fragmented into fragment ions upon colliding with singly charged negative reagent ions with the cell 1. The cell comprises a plurality of ring electrodes 1, preferably at least five, which form a spherical, spheroidal or ellipsoidal trapping volume 4. Ions experience negligible RF heating over the majority of the trapping volume which enables the kinetic energy of the analyte and reagent ions to be reduced to just above thermal temperatures. An electron transfer dissociation cell 1 having an enhanced sensitivity is thereby provided. Fragment ions created within the cell 1 may be cooled and transmitted onwardly to an orthogonal acceleration time of flight mass analyser (see Figure 5) enabling a significant improvement in the resolution of the mass analyser to be obtained.",MICROMASS LTD,GREEN MARTIN;;WILDGOOSE JASON LEE;;BROWN JEFFREY MARK,,https://lens.org/165-608-541-046-415,Patent Application,no,3,0,3,24,0,H01J49/0045;;H01J49/0072;;H01J49/065;;H01J49/0072;;H01J49/065,H01J49/00;;H01J49/42,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
