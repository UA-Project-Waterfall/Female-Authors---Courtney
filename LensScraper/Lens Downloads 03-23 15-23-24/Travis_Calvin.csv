The web application identifies potential team members referenced in the information sources and constructs a semantic network describing the skill sets and team suitability of those potential team members. The web application allows a registered user to enter the roles and capabilities required for a project team they wish to create. Once the user has entered a description of their desired project team, the application automatically constructs candidate teams by analyzing the semantic network to identify appropriate candidate teams given constraints on roles and skills. Four methods for identifying teams from the semantic network are provided. The system then provides the user with a set of recommended team members. In an iterative process, the user adjusts constraints on the team member capabilities until a satisfactory team is identified.

Trata-se de cigarros que são fabricados utilizando-se aparelhos automáticos modificados para a fabricação de cigarros. Tais cigarros possuem cilindros de passagem de fumaça que apresentam materiais envoltórios que têm aplicados neles, como padrões, materiais aditivos. Os materiais aditivos, que podem ter as formas de formulações líquidas e pastosa (por exemplo, formulações que incorporam amido ou amido modificado) , são aplicados em Lima manta de papel contínua sobre o aparelho de fabricação de cigarro. A formulação é aplicada na manta de papel usando um aparelho de aplicação que possui roletes. Por exemplo, o material aditivo é aplicado na face laminada de um rolete de transferência devido à interação laminada daquele rolete de transferência com o rolete de preensão; a interação laminada do rolete de transferência com um rolete de aplicação ocasiona a trasferência do material aditivo a partir do rolete de transferência até o rolete de aplicação, e o material aditivo a partir do rolete de aplicação é transferido até a manta de papel que passa entre o rolete de aplicação e o rolete de cópia. Os componentes decorativos do aparelho automático de fabricação de cigarro, inclusive uma montagem de corrediça projetada e um cone de entrada, podem ser modificados para incluírem a distribuição de vazão aérea para impedir que a manta de papel e o material aditivo entrem em contato com a corrediça projetada. Uma secadora radiante é utilizada para secar o material aditivo que fora aplicado à manta de papel. A secadora radiante é colocada *sobre um componente de uma montagem de dois componentes que é utilizada para fabricar cigarros. Um primeiro componente da montagem, de dois componentes proporciona uma fonte de manta de papel, aplica material aditivo àquela manta em um padrão e seca a manta de papel; ao mesmo tempo em que um segundo componente recebe a manta de papel, fornece a carga de fumo e fabrica um cilindro de cigarro a partir da manta de papel e da carga de fumo. Um sistema alternativo de montagem proporciona uma fonte de manta de papel, aplica material aditivo àquela manta em um padrão, seca a manta de papel, e enrola a manta de papel tratada em uma bobina; e aquela bobina é usada mais tarde para fornecer uma fonte de manta de papel sobre uma máquina de fabricação de cigarro que desenrola a bobina, recebe a manta de papel tratada proveniente daquela bobina, fornece a carga de fumo e fabrica um cilindro de cigarro a partir da manta de papel.e carga de fumo.

The additive materials, which can have the forms of liquid or paste formulations (e.g., aqueous formulations incorporating starch or modified starch), are applied to a continuous paper web on the cigarette making apparatus. The formulation is applied to the paper web using application apparatus possessing rollers. For example, additive material is applied to the roll face of a transfer roller due to roll interaction of that transfer roller with a pick-up roller; roll interaction of the transfer roller with an application roller causes transfer of the additive material from the transfer roller to the application roller; and additive material from the application roller is transferred to the paper web that passes between the application roller and a back-up roller. The garniture components of the automated cigarette making apparatus, including a finger rail assembly and an entrance cone, can be modified to include air flow distribution to prevent the paper web and the additive material from contacting the finger rail. A radiant dryer is used to dry the additive material that has been applied to the paper web. The radiant dryer is located on one component of a two component assembly that is used to manufacture cigarettes. A first component of the two component assembly provides a source of paper web, applies additive material to that web in a pattern and dries the paper web; while a second component receives the paper web, supplies tobacco filler, and manufactures a cigarette rod from the paper web and tobacco filler. An alternate assembly system provides a source of paper web, applies additive material to that web in a pattern, dries the paper web, and winds the treated paper web onto a bobbin; and that bobbin is later used to provide a source of paper web on a cigarette making machine that unrolls the bobbin, receives the treated paper web from that bobbin, supplies tobacco filler, and manufactures a cigarette rod from the paper web and tobacco filler. Spectrometric techniques are used to ensure proper registration of the additive material on the cigarette rods so manufactured, and to ensure proper quality of those cigarettes.",REYNOLDS TOBACCO CO R;;HANCOCK LLOYD HARMON;;SHORE FORD MITCHELL;;BARNES RUSSELL DEAN;;BARNES VERNON BRENT;;GREENE CARL CARLTON JR;;NELSON JOHN LARKIN;;SEYMOUR SYDNEY KEITH;;ADEME BALAGER;;HOWARD TRAVIS EUGENE;;HENDERSON CALVIN WAYNE;;DEAL PHILIP ANDREW;;FITZGERALD JOHN;;OGLESBY ROBERT LESLIE;;FAGG BARRY SMITH,HANCOCK LLOYD HARMON;;SHORE FORD MITCHELL;;BARNES RUSSELL DEAN;;BARNES VERNON BRENT;;GREENE CARL CARLTON JR;;NELSON JOHN LARKIN;;SEYMOUR SYDNEY KEITH;;ADEME BALAGER;;HOWARD TRAVIS EUGENE;;HENDERSON CALVIN WAYNE;;DEAL PHILIP ANDREW;;FITZGERALD JOHN;;OGLESBY ROBERT LESLIE;;FAGG BARRY SMITH,,https://lens.org/130-424-312-218-117,Search Report,yes,11,0,19,39,0,A24D1/025;;A24D1/025;;A24C5/005;;A24C5/005;;A24C5/20;;A24C5/20,A24C1/26;;A24C5/00;;A24C5/32,,1,0,,,See also references of EP 1575385A2,PENDING
