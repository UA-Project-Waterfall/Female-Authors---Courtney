Thus, the oscillated signal having an oscillation frequency independent and stable in a change of an external condition such as the power supply voltage or the temperature is obtained. <P>COPYRIGHT: (C)2004,JPO",SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO LTD,CHUNG KYU-YOUNG,,https://lens.org/096-483-763-031-262,Patent Application,no,0,2,5,5,0,H03B5/04;;H03K3/011;;H03K3/0231;;H03K3/00;;H03K3/0231;;H03B5/04;;H03K3/011,H03B5/04;;H03K3/00;;H03K3/354;;H03K3/011;;H03K3/0231;;H03K3/0233,,0,0,,,,PENDING

    A digital to analog converter (DAC) can comprise: an escalator code generator; and an escalator-code-to-analog converter (ECAC). The generator can (1) represent base  10  numbers with a mixed code having a coin code portion and a cash code portion, which will eliminate multi-bit changes in the cash code upon changes in count direction; and (2) represent a count in a first direction as the sum of the coin code and the cash code. The generator can alter the coin code when the count changes direction while the cash code remains the same until a count capacity of the coin code is exceeded, at which point the cash code can be altered. Cycling between adjacent base  10  numbers is absorbed by the coin code while keeping the cash code the same, which reduces noise introduced into an output of the ECAC due to such cycling.

In addition, the Vaccinium uliginosum extract is suitable to use as a component for improving skin wrinkles in cosmetics, foods and drugs, because the Vaccinium uliginosum extract can achieve the effect of improving skin conditions, even when it is applied to the skin or used internally.",CHUNG SE YOUNG,YOUNG CHUNG SE,INDUSTRY ACADEMIC COOPERATION FOUNDATION KYUNGHEE (2012-02-27),https://lens.org/046-763-937-737-162,Granted Patent,no,0,0,9,9,0,A23L33/105;;A23L33/105;;A61K8/9789;;A23L33/105;;A23V2002/00;;A23V2200/318;;A61K8/602;;A61K8/9789;;A61K8/9789;;A61K36/45;;A61K36/45;;A61K36/45;;A61K2800/522;;A61K2800/522;;A61K2800/522;;A61K2800/782;;A61K2800/782;;A61P17/16;;A61P17/16;;A61P17/18;;A61P17/18;;A61P43/00;;A61Q17/04;;A61Q19/02;;A61Q19/02;;A61Q19/02;;A61Q19/08;;A61Q19/08;;A61Q19/08,A61K8/97;;A61Q19/02;;A61Q19/08,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

   A system and method for detecting a defect in a transistor array includes applying a test signal to the array, monitoring pixel voltage along a gate line of the array, and detecting a defect associated with the gate line based on a variation in the pixel voltage during the monitoring step. The defect may be a short between the gate line and a common line of the array. The gate line and common line may be associated with a same pixel element or different pixel elements. The system and method also detect a precise location of the defect based on a rate of change in the variation of the pixel voltage along the gate line. The rate of change may be measured in any one of a variety of ways. For example, the rate of change may be measured as a sudden increase or increase of the pixel voltage or as a change in slope of a pixel voltage profile. Alternatively, the location of the defect may be detected as corresponding to a minimum or maximum value in a pixel voltage profile. The transistor array may be a TFT array or another circuit which includes an array of transistors.

The generator can (1) represent base 10 numbers with a mixed code having a coin code portion and a cash code portion, which will eliminate multi-bit changes in the cash code upon changes in count direction; and (2) represent a count in a first direction as the sum of the coin code and the cash code. The generator can alter the coin code when the count changes direction while the cash code remains the same until a count capacity of the coin code is exceeded, at which point the cash code can be altered. Cycling between adjacent base 10 numbers is absorbed by the coin code while keeping the cash code the same, which reduces noise introduced into an output of the ECAC due to such cycling.",SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO LTD,CHUNG IN-YOUNG,,https://lens.org/057-323-575-579-848,Search Report,yes,4,0,15,15,0,G11C7/16;;G11C7/22;;G11C7/222;;H03L7/089;;H03M1/0687;;H03M1/0863;;H03M1/664;;H03M1/745;;H03L7/0816;;H03M7/00;;H03M1/0687;;G11C7/22;;H03M1/745;;G11C7/16;;G11C7/222;;H03M1/664;;H03M1/0863;;H03L7/089;;H03L7/0816,G11C7/16;;G11C7/22;;H03L7/081;;H03L7/089;;H03M1/06;;H03M1/68;;H03M1/08;;H03M1/66;;H03M1/74;;H03M7/00,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
