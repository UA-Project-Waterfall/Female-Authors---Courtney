To solve problems as described above, even if a transmitter is not able to apply an accurate data transmission rate suitable for a channel state to data and to transmit the data, a receiver applies an adaptive SWSC to reduce a block error rate (BLER) and a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) overhead of the receiver.

A charge sharing time of a pixel group located closest to a source driver in the pixel array is greater than a charge sharing time of a pixel group located farthest from the source driver in the pixel array.",SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO LTD,CHOI CHUL-HO;;HUANG YU-CHIEH;;SHIN HA-JOON;;SU HAN-CHIANG;;CHEN JIA-WAY;;LEE KYUNL-YEOL;;WEN YI-CHIEN;;SONG YONG-JOO;;HUANG SHIH-CHIAO,,https://lens.org/086-266-858-217-197,Patent of Addition,no,0,0,2,2,0,G09G3/3688;;G09G2310/08;;G09G2310/0248;;G09G2330/021;;G09G3/20;;G09G2310/0251;;G09G2320/0223;;G09G2310/0275,G09G3/20;;G09G3/36,,0,0,,,,PENDING
