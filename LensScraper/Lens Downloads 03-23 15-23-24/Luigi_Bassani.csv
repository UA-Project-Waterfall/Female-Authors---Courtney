PER AZIONI BASSANI. Oct. 22, 1953, No. 29210/53. Class 38(1). A fluorescent lamp-holder comprises a twopart casing 1, 2, housing leaf-spring contacts 5, 6 which bear on a rotatable insulating body 7 having a diametral slot 7<SP>1</SP> in its front face to admit the lamp pins when in line with a slot 2<SP>11</SP> in body portion 2, the body then being rotated through 90 degrees to bring the pins into engagement with contacts 5, 6. Body 7 has a rearwardly-facing groove 7<SP>11</SP> parallel to slot 7<SP>1</SP> which serves as an indicator of the position of the lamp. A socket 17 for a starter may be attached to the base of the holder, terminals being provided thereon comprising plates 18 with turned down corners between which and the contacts, conductor ends are inserted and clamped by screws 19.
