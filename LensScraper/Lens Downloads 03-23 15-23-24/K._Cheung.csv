The construction makes it possible to remove all of an intermediate oxide layer during manufacture except for an oxide layer above the poly load resistor. This elimination of one oxide layer, together with the integration of the conductive metal silicide and underlying poly silicon into one layer and the rounding of the metal silicide edge with oxide spacers via anisotropic etching of the intermediate oxide layer, permits better step coverage for the resulting structure.",ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC,CHEUNG ROBIN W;;CHAN HUGO W K,ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC 901 THOMPSON PL BOX 3453 SUNNYVALE CA 94088 A DE CORP (1984-03-01),https://lens.org/049-222-097-180-548,Granted Patent,yes,4,23,5,6,0,H01L21/76801;;H01L21/76834;;H01L21/76889;;H01L21/76895;;H01L23/53271;;H01L29/41725;;H01L29/4933;;Y10S438/978;;Y10S257/904;;Y10S148/147;;Y10S148/019;;Y10S148/133;;H01L2924/0002;;H01L21/76889;;H01L23/53271;;H01L21/76801;;H01L21/76834;;H01L21/76895;;H01L29/41725;;H01L29/4933;;Y10S148/133;;Y10S257/904;;Y10S148/147;;Y10S438/978;;Y10S148/019;;H01L2924/0002,H01L21/31;;H01L21/3205;;H01L21/768;;H01L23/532;;H01L29/417;;H01L29/49,29577C;;29/590;;29/591;;X148DIG 19;;X148DIG 133;;X148DIG 147;;357/67;;357/71;;427/88;;427/93,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A two-dimensional array of lateral-effect detectors (or position-sensing devices) is used to simultaneously measure multi-point centroidal locations at high speed. It is one of the primary components of a high-speed optical wavefront sensor design comprising a Shack-Hartmann-type lenslet array and associated analog circuitry including analog-to-digital (A/D) converters, and digital micro-processors. The detector array measures the centroidal location of each incident beam emerging from the lenslet array and calculates the local wavefront slope based on the beam deviations from their respective subaperture centers. The wavefront sensor is designed for high temporal bandwidth operation and is ideally suited for applications such as laser-beam propagation through boundary-layer turbulence, atmospheric turbulence, or imperfect optics. The wavefront sensor may be coupled with a deformable mirror as primary components of an adaptive optics system.

The first mask layer and the second mask layer are patterned to form first gate mask and second gate mask respectively. The polysilicon gate is then formed by anisotropically etching the polysilicon layer. The second gate mask is then removed. The polysilicon gate is then etched isotropically to reduce its width using the gate oxide layer and the patterned first gate mask as hard masks. The first gate mask is then used as a mask for dopant implantation to form source and drain extensions which are spaced away from the edges of the polysilicon gate. Thereafter, the first gate mask is removed and a spacer is formed dopant implantation to form deep source and drain junctions. A higher temperature rapid thermal anneal then optimizes the source and drain extension junctions and junctions, and the spacer is removed.

Winding refers to bending of the elongated elastic fiber caused by axial compression. A continuous flow microfluidic method achieves high throughput measurement of the elasticity of microfibers by winding, where sample loading and unloading are not required between continuous measurements. In some embodiments, the winding radius is proportional to the elastic modulus of the fiber, facilitating calibration to measure fiber elasticity for high throughput applications. The flux can be thousands of times higher than that of a tensile testing machine, so that in-situ online measurement can be carried out in a microfluid production line, and manufacturing of microfibers and measurement of elasticity are combined on the same production line. The method can also be used for measuring some fibers with local elasticity change.",UNIV HONG KONG;;UNIV PRINCETON,LIU YUAN;;SHUM HO CHEUNG;;NUNES JANINE K;;STONE HOWARD A,,https://lens.org/052-803-806-298-818,Patent Application,no,0,0,3,3,0,G01N3/08;;G01N2203/0019;;G01N2203/0075;;G01N2203/0682;;G01N2203/028;;G01N2203/0298;;G01N33/365;;G01N3/068;;G01N3/08;;G01N2203/0075,G01N3/26,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Rope-coiling refers to the buckling of a slender elastic fiber caused by axial compression. A continuous flow microfluidic method enables the high-throughput measurement of the elasticity of microfibers by rope-coiling, where sample loading and unloading are not needed between consecutive measurements. In certain embodiments the coiling radius can be directly proportional to the elastic modulus of the fiber, facilitating calibration to measure fiber elasticity for high-throughput applications. Throughput can be thousands of times higher than that of a tensile tester, making possible an in situ, on-line measurement in a microfluidic production line, which couples the making of microfibers and the measurement of elasticity on the same line. The new method can also measure certain fibers with local variations in elasticity.",VERSITECH LTD;;UNIV PRINCETON,LIU YUAN;;SHUM ANDERSON HO CHEUNG;;NUNES JANINE K;;STONE HOWARD A,,https://lens.org/005-365-810-049-994,Patent Application,yes,0,0,3,3,0,G01N3/08;;G01N2203/0019;;G01N2203/0075;;G01N2203/0682;;G01N2203/028;;G01N2203/0298;;G01N33/365;;G01N3/068;;G01N3/08;;G01N2203/0075,G01N3/06;;G01N3/08,,0,0,,,,PENDING

Rope-coiling refers to the buckling of a slender elastic fiber caused by axial compression. A continuous flow microfluidic method enables the high-throughput measurement of the elasticity of microfibers by rope-coiling, where sample loading and unloading are not needed between consecutive measurements. In certain embodiments the coiling radius can be directly proportional to the elastic modulus of the fiber, facilitating calibration to measure fiber elasticity for high-throughput applications. Throughput can be thousands of times higher than that of a tensile tester, making possible an in situ, on-line measurement in a microfluidic production line, which couples the making of microfibers and the measurement of elasticity on the same line. The new method can also measure certain fibers with local variations in elasticity.

The laser includes a main cavity in which the lasing medium is disposed and an external cavity including a non-linear element. The non-linear element is selected to induce a non-linear phase shift in a coherent beam from the main cavity. In operation, a portion of a laser beam in the main cavity is coupled to the external cavity and a phase-shifted output from the external cavity is reflected back into the main cavity to provide a narrow pulse, mode-locked output from the laser. In one embodiment the non-linear element of the external cavity is an optical fiber with a mirror disposed adjacent one end of the optical fiber to provide dual propagation of a laser pulse through the fiber. In high-power applications the external cavity mirror is disposed proximate but spaced apart from the optical fiber end. The ends of the optical fiber are treated to avoid multiple reflections and Q-switching in lasing media having long relaxation times. In one embodiment the optical fiber ends form surfaces non-perpendicular to the laser beam path. Coupling between the main and external cavity may be provided by a beam splitter disposed either externally or within the main cavity. The beam splitter may also have a reflectance depending upon the polarization orientation of an incident beam. The percentage of a laser beam from the main cavity coupled into the external cavity may then be varied by the addition of a quarter-wave plate to allow changes in the polarization orientation of the beam incident on the beam splitter.",UNIV CALIFORNIA,CHEE JOSEPH K;;CHEUNG ERIC C T;;KONG MO-NGA;;LIU JIA-MING,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THE A CORP.

Such hydrogels can include polyethylene glycol with diacrylate functional groups (e.g., PEGDA), which are photopolymerizable in the presence of crosslinkers and photoinitiators. By using PEGDA monomers of different molecular weights and at different percentages, the mechanical properties of the polymerized gels and their respective permeabilities can be tuned. This spatial variation in properties and permeabilities can lead to different functionalities between different portions of the hydrogel MEMS device. Portions of the hydrogel device may be remotely actuated by applying wave energy, for example, a magnetic field, high intensity focused ultrasound, and/or infrared radiation. The remote actuation can allow the device to be actuated in vivo, for example, to allow the device to deliver a drug or other substance at a desired time and/or desired location within a patient.",UNIV COLUMBIA;;THE TRUSTEES OF COLUMBIA IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK,SIA SAMUEL K;;CHIN SAU YIN;;KOHLER ANNE-CELINE;;POH YUK KEE CHEUNG,THE TRUSTEES OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK (2013-09-18),https://lens.org/094-363-365-538-309,Granted Patent,yes,13,0,4,5,0,A61M5/16813;;A61M5/16813;;A61K9/0024;;A61K9/0024;;A61M5/14276;;A61M5/14276;;A61M2205/0244;;A61M2205/0244;;B82Y5/00;;B82Y5/00,A61M5/168;;A61K9/00;;A61M5/142;;B82Y5/00,,77,67,074-138-517-482-02X;;027-536-130-974-491;;010-864-244-305-953;;111-051-254-377-102;;051-953-463-348-154;;106-134-275-595-697;;093-531-030-711-089;;042-308-574-297-689;;070-913-702-560-623;;004-000-039-551-228;;016-942-507-959-393;;049-495-192-429-43X;;009-830-126-993-897;;039-266-133-393-543;;021-530-980-119-015;;079-458-745-329-822;;027-177-154-094-913;;073-893-277-390-638;;000-443-701-241-142;;011-778-459-713-749;;087-333-189-994-274;;028-848-496-034-567;;105-416-245-126-370;;014-222-870-344-854;;001-628-993-138-223;;028-307-853-572-805;;119-489-813-926-006;;039-430-189-157-648;;174-738-251-946-994;;009-539-369-616-590;;047-251-523-791-115;;055-590-571-659-22X;;118-367-302-556-62X;;117-748-513-076-514;;052-018-843-581-985;;063-044-870-935-046;;018-643-955-479-759;;035-532-082-899-598;;098-061-024-370-335;;069-293-131-681-105;;092-788-118-459-874;;085-956-528-681-570;;053-934-040-807-557;;020-311-112-151-262;;098-890-816-584-639;;093-604-341-442-300;;018-253-019-826-291;;004-532-741-633-626;;019-987-249-651-430;;113-516-601-000-474;;011-247-673-432-38X;;115-114-175-299-362;;015-463-166-936-139;;160-217-156-081-046;;059-783-772-818-457;;125-470-202-635-477;;010-593-620-990-359;;002-280-056-133-331;;096-321-347-925-943;;045-562-988-184-767;;006-794-867-091-511;;102-404-827-278-262;;017-049-658-842-138;;162-786-610-008-993;;063-087-080-018-104;;066-764-160-048-535;;154-333-077-067-503,10.1088/0960-1317/16/2/018;;10.1039/b806446f;;18941687;;pmc2970504;;10.1038/nmeth873;;16628207;;10.1002/1097-4636(20000905)51:3<343::aid-jbm7>3.0.co;2-d;;10880075;;10.1038/35093038;;11557992;;12117759;;10.1146/annurev.bioeng.4.112601.125916;;10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.08.015;;pmc2585524;;18804859;;15638543;;10.1021/bm049508a;;pmc2678566;;19479917;;10.1002/anie.200900807;;10.1039/b700869d;;17476375;;17180204;;10.1039/b611455e;;9720892;;10.1016/s0142-9612(98)00025-8;;10.1177/096368979900800310;;10442742;;10.1016/s0003-2670(00)01256-3;;21059375;;10.1016/j.jconrel.2010.10.036;;10.1016/s0142-9612(03)00340-5;;12922147;;10.1038/nrd1088;;12750738;;14741116;;10.1016/j.addr.2003.08.013;;19169826;;10.1007/s10544-008-9272-6;;10.1021/ac069475k;;17128516;;12413548;;10.1016/s1367-5931(02)00371-x;;10.1021/ac0255330;;12069222;;10.1517/17425247.3.4.479;;16822223;;10.1109/memsys.2010.5442574;;10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.01.012;;19201020;;10.1038/nmat2203;;18511938;;15559850;;10.1163/1568562041959991;;10.1109/jproc.2003.820534;;10.1109/mmb.2002.1002356;;11755704;;10.1016/s0169-409x(01)00240-x;;10.1016/j.polymer.2008.01.027;;10.1038/nbt871;;14520403;;10.1039/b805176c;;18813385;;18261792;;10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.12.048;;pmc2293299;;19495448;;10.1039/b819999j;;10.1089/dia.2006.8.112;;16472058;;pmc3079502;;10.1039/c0nr00932f;;21321760;;15544869;;10.1016/j.jconrel.2004.08.018;;19708075;;10.1002/jbm.a.32595;;15987099;;10.1021/ac0502706.s001;;10.1021/ac0502706;;16278032;;10.1016/j.jconrel.2005.09.035;;10.1021/ma010025y;;pmc3073071;;21401092;;10.1021/ja200894u;;11751413;;10.1007/s11095-006-0028-9;;16715391;;21698338;;10.1039/c1lc20134d;;10.1126/science.290.5496.1536;;11090344;;10.1109/memsys.2011.5734601;;10.1146/annurev.bioeng.6.040803.140027;;15255762;;20379157;;10.1038/nbt0410-298;;10.1016/j.addr.2003.07.012;;14741114;;10.1016/j.jconrel.2007.08.024;;17904240;;19495462;;10.1039/b822694f;;10.1109/iembs.2006.260534;;17947154;;10.1111/j.1365-2818.2005.01512.x;;16269060;;14613181;;10.1002/elps.200305584;;21158487;;10.3109/02656736.2010.518198;;10.1109/iros.2009.5354162;;10.1016/j.addr.2004.05.001;;15350293;;15193114;;10.1021/ac040063q;;10.1016/s0142-9612(02)00565-3;;12615486;;11447067;;10.1146/annurev.bioeng.3.1.335;;10.1109/mmb.2000.893800;;10.1063/1.1367010;;11161212;;10.1126/science.291.5506.1023;;21149682;;10.1073/pnas.1007862108;;pmc3017202;;17511110;;10.1109/iembs.2004.1403766,"2nd Annu.

The method further includes reducing dimensionality of the time series history of measurements with a convolutional autoencoder to obtain latent features for each of the plurality of candidate objects. The method also includes applying a kernel regression model to the latent features to generate a predicted value of physical output for performing the physical process on each of the plurality of candidate objects. The method additionally includes generating a prioritization of the candidate objects based on the values of physical output.

Fluorescing ions are distributed across the area in which separation of the mixture will occur to provide a generally uniform background fluorescence intensity. For example, the mixture is comprised of one or more charged analytes which displace fluorescing ions where its constituent components separate to. Fluorescing ions of the same charge as the charged analyte components cause a displacement. The displacement results in the location of the separated components having a reduced fluorescence intensity to the remainder of the background. Detection of the lower fluorescence intensity areas can be visually, by photographic means and methods, or by automated laser scanning.",UNIV IOWA STATE RES FOUND INC,YEUNG EDWARD S;;KOUTNY LANCE B;;HOGAN BARRY L;;CHEUNG CHAN K;;MA YINFA,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FOUNDATION INC.

By using PEGDA monomers of different molecular weights and at different percentages, the mechanical properties of the polymerized gels and their respective permeabilities can be tuned. This spatial variation in properties and permeabilities can lead to different functionalities between different portions of the hydrogel MEMS device. Portions of the hydrogel device may be remotely actuated by applying wave energy, for example, a magnetic field, high intensity focused ultrasound, and/or infrared radiation.

The state model is created by selecting a template for the state model, and selecting industrial or business object components for the state model (for example, by using OOP methods or other programming paradigms). The user then selects or defines state transitions for the state model, for example, by defining permitted state transitions from a from state to a to state. The defined or selected state transition rules are identified to State Transition Rule names. That is, state transitions are associated to specific state transition rules, names, and conditions, and the state transition names and state transition rule names are enumerated.

Such hydrogels can include polyethylene glycol with diacrylate functional groups (e.g., PEGDA), which are photopolymerizable in the presence of crosslinkers and photoinitiators. By using PEGDA monomers of different molecular weights and at different percentages, the mechanical properties of the polymerized gels and their respective permeabilities can be tuned. This spatial variation in properties and permeabilities can lead to different functionalities between different portions of the hydrogel MEMS device. Portions of the hydrogel device may be remotely actuated by applying wave energy, for example, a magnetic field, high intensity focused ultrasound, and/or infrared radiation. The remote actuation can allow the device to be actuated in vivo, for example, to allow the device to deliver a drug or other substance at a desired time and/or desired location within a patient.",UNIV COLUMBIA,ORDEIG OLGA;;SIA SAMUEL K;;CHIN SAU YIN;;KOHLER ANNE CELINE;;POH YUK KEE CHEUNG,THE TRUSTEES OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK (2013-09-18),https://lens.org/012-522-969-591-726,Granted Patent,yes,13,1,4,5,0,A61M5/16813;;A61M5/16813;;A61K9/0024;;A61K9/0024;;A61M5/14276;;A61M5/14276;;A61M2205/0244;;A61M2205/0244;;B82Y5/00;;B82Y5/00,A61M5/315;;A61K9/00;;A61M5/142;;A61M5/168;;B82Y5/00,,78,68,106-134-275-595-697;;016-942-507-959-393;;018-253-019-826-291;;125-470-202-635-477;;045-562-988-184-767;;102-404-827-278-262;;051-953-463-348-154;;039-266-133-393-543;;028-848-496-034-567;;055-590-571-659-22X;;039-430-189-157-648;;011-778-459-713-749;;087-333-189-994-274;;006-794-867-091-511;;027-536-130-974-491;;069-293-131-681-105;;001-628-993-138-223;;093-531-030-711-089;;111-051-254-377-102;;009-830-126-993-897;;047-251-523-791-115;;019-987-249-651-430;;009-539-369-616-590;;117-748-513-076-514;;098-890-816-584-639;;115-114-175-299-362;;028-307-853-572-805;;063-087-080-018-104;;027-177-154-094-913;;070-913-702-560-623;;049-495-192-429-43X;;118-367-302-556-62X;;079-458-745-329-822;;004-000-039-551-228;;052-018-843-581-985;;010-864-244-305-953;;096-321-347-925-943;;098-061-024-370-335;;113-516-601-000-474;;020-311-112-151-262;;042-308-574-297-689;;085-956-528-681-570;;066-764-160-048-535;;059-783-772-818-457;;119-489-813-926-006;;035-532-082-899-598;;017-049-658-842-138;;073-893-277-390-638;;162-786-610-008-993;;074-138-517-482-02X;;093-604-341-442-300;;004-532-741-633-626;;063-044-870-935-046;;154-333-077-067-503;;018-643-955-479-759;;021-530-980-119-015;;010-593-620-990-359;;053-934-040-807-557;;002-280-056-133-331;;092-788-118-459-874;;000-443-701-241-142;;006-794-867-091-511;;014-222-870-344-854;;011-247-673-432-38X;;174-738-251-946-994;;105-416-245-126-370;;160-217-156-081-046;;015-463-166-936-139,12117759;;10.1146/annurev.bioeng.4.112601.125916;;17180204;;10.1039/b611455e;;10.1126/science.290.5496.1536;;11090344;;14613181;;10.1002/elps.200305584;;15193114;;10.1021/ac040063q;;11447067;;10.1146/annurev.bioeng.3.1.335;;10.1038/35093038;;11557992;;10.1016/s0003-2670(00)01256-3;;10.1021/ac0255330;;12069222;;10.1038/nbt871;;14520403;;10.1109/jproc.2003.820534;;10.1021/ac069475k;;17128516;;12413548;;10.1016/s1367-5931(02)00371-x;;10.1016/s0142-9612(02)00565-3;;12615486;;10.1039/b806446f;;18941687;;pmc2970504;;15987099;;10.1021/ac0502706.s001;;10.1021/ac0502706;;10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.01.012;;19201020;;10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.08.015;;pmc2585524;;18804859;;10.1002/1097-4636(20000905)51:3<343::aid-jbm7>3.0.co;2-d;;10880075;;10.1177/096368979900800310;;10442742;;10.1016/j.polymer.2008.01.027;;10.1146/annurev.bioeng.6.040803.140027;;15255762;;11755704;;10.1016/s0169-409x(01)00240-x;;18261792;;10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.12.048;;pmc2293299;;10.1007/s11095-006-0028-9;;16715391;;10.1016/j.jconrel.2007.08.024;;17904240;;10.1038/nmat2203;;18511938;;11161212;;10.1126/science.291.5506.1023;;10.1038/nrd1088;;12750738;;19479917;;10.1002/anie.200900807;;9720892;;10.1016/s0142-9612(98)00025-8;;10.1039/b805176c;;18813385;;10.1016/s0142-9612(03)00340-5;;12922147;;10.1039/b700869d;;17476375;;19495448;;10.1039/b819999j;;10.1038/nmeth873;;16628207;;10.1016/j.addr.2004.05.001;;15350293;;19708075;;10.1002/jbm.a.32595;;20379157;;10.1038/nbt0410-298;;11751413;;15638543;;10.1021/bm049508a;;pmc2678566;;10.1021/ma010025y;;21149682;;10.1073/pnas.1007862108;;pmc3017202;;10.1111/j.1365-2818.2005.01512.x;;16269060;;15559850;;10.1163/1568562041959991;;15544869;;10.1016/j.jconrel.2004.08.018;;10.1109/mmb.2000.893800;;14741116;;10.1016/j.addr.2003.08.013;;10.1063/1.1367010;;10.1088/0960-1317/16/2/018;;21698338;;10.1039/c1lc20134d;;10.1109/memsys.2011.5734601;;10.1089/dia.2006.8.112;;16472058;;17511110;;10.1109/iembs.2004.1403766;;pmc3079502;;10.1039/c0nr00932f;;21321760;;21059375;;10.1016/j.jconrel.2010.10.036;;21158487;;10.3109/02656736.2010.518198;;pmc3073071;;21401092;;10.1021/ja200894u;;10.1109/iros.2009.5354162;;16278032;;10.1016/j.jconrel.2005.09.035;;19169826;;10.1007/s10544-008-9272-6;;10.1016/s0142-9612(02)00565-3;;12615486;;10.1109/memsys.2010.5442574;;10.1016/j.addr.2003.07.012;;14741114;;10.1109/mmb.2002.1002356;;10.1517/17425247.3.4.479;;16822223;;10.1109/iembs.2006.260534;;17947154;;19495462;;10.1039/b822694f,"Cheung, Yuk Kee, “Fabrication of Multi-Component Hydrogel Microstructrues and Microdevices,” Doctoral Thesis, Columbia University, 2010.;;Screen Capture of Publication of Cheung, Yuk Kee, “Fabrication of Multi-Compnent Hydrogel Microstructures and Microdevices,” Doctorial Thesis, Columbia University, Columbia University Library, Jan. 1, 2010.;;Beebe, D.J., G.A.

The mesh network forms a self-healing and self-configuring network robust against individual node failures. Wireless mesh networking integrated circuits (ICs), energy monitoring ICs and solid state relays are used to create a low-cost, easy-to-install energy visualization and management system. The system can intelligently control energy usage at the sockets to stop energy from being wasted. Software for a central base station uses energy usage data from each node to create an energy usage profile to automatically detect anomalies in energy usage and take steps to correct them. Other sensors can be easily added for a multitude of applications.

   The present invention relates to a bone fixation device having a fixation member using a shape memory effect to secure bone fractures, including but not limited to, femur, tibia and humerus fractures. The fixation member can be malleable at a room temperature, but become rigid at a body temperature because of the shape memory effect, such as derived from a super-elastic property found in such as a nickel titanium alloy. The fixation member can be formed on one or more of the shaft portion and the two end portions of a nail member for securing bone fractures, such as by providing translational and rotational stabilities. The fixation member is also capable of providing a continuous and controllable compression force over the fractured bone, if needed.

Optional valve arrays can be used to controllably eject marking agents for marking or coating a paper or other suitable substrate. Each valve in the valve array has one or more flap elements positioned in a valve chamber. These flap elements are movable to alternatively block the fluid flow through valve chamber outlets with the aid of various catch mechanisms for controllably latching the flap elements. The catch mechanisms have a disabled state and an activated state for holding and allowing release of the flap elements. Once the catch mechanism are disabled, the flap elements are free to move to another position, provided they can overcome the mechanical fluid flow forces that tend to hold it in position. To counter and utilize such forces for moving the flap elements, an impulse mechanism kicks the flap element into the valve chamber, away from the catch mechanisms. Since the position of the flap elements is unstable, oscillations of the flap elements in the fluid flow will eventually bring the flap element into catchment range of another catch mechanism in an activated state.",XEROX COPORATION,YIM MARK H;;JACKSON WARREN B;;CHASE JAMES G;;BIEGELSEN DAVID K;;CHEUNG PATRICK C P;;BERLIN ANDREW A;;HORNE KENNETH N,XEROX CORPORATION (1998-03-27),https://lens.org/059-479-833-445-599,Granted Patent,yes,5,8,6,6,0,B65H5/228;;Y10T137/87812;;Y10T137/87812;;B65H5/228,B65H5/22,118/684;;137/875,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
