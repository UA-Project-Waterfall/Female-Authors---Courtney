The proximal end is provided with openings which extend into a lumen which forms a fluid-flow passageway extending between the proximal and distal ends. Either flanges or inflatable cuffs, which can be inflated to form a balloon extending around the tubular body, are provided intermediate the length of the tubular body. The outwardly projecting flanges or the inflated cuff portions form projections which maintain the position of the fetal shunt after it is implanted. The distal end of the tubular body of the shunt is provided with a valve for permitting fluid flow outwardly of the tubular body. The shunt provides a method for transferring cerebral spinal fluid from the fetal cranium to the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus.",AMERICAN HOSPITAL SUPPLY CORP,BRODNER ROBERT A;;BLEY ROBERT S;;DORMANDY JR RAY H,AMERICAN HOSPITAL SUPPLY CORPORATION A CORP.
