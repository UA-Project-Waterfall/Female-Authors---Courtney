    A phase locked loop is employed to provide a clock signal for controlling the reading or writing of audio data from or into a memory to avoid memory overflow and underrun. The difference between the write and read pointers is monitored and used for adjusting a divider counter used in the feedback loop of the phase locked loop, by incrementing, decrementing by one or leaving unchanged the value of the counter. The counter is used to divide the output of the phase locked loop to provide a reference signal to the phase locked loop. A reference frequency for reading the audio data may be set close to the writing speed by incrementing or decrementing the reading speed by fine adjustment steps until the reference frequency is reached. After the reference frequency is reached, the reading speed is changed between the reference frequency and a frequency one fine adjustment step away from the reference frequency so that the average reading speed is equal to the writing speed.

The detection device employs the fluorescent light transport channel (30) formed by the optical fiber (32) or the optical fiber bundle (31), thus reducing energy loss of emitted fluorescent light in a light path transmission, being cleaner than a traditional open transmission structure, not readily polluted by dust, and improving experiment accuracy and sensitivity.",YU STEVE JIA CHANG;;IGENESYS LTD;;AORAN BIOTECHNOLOGY SHANGHAI CO LTD,YU STEVE JIA CHANG,,https://lens.org/111-255-442-702-552,Patent Application,yes,6,7,2,2,0,G01N21/64,G01N21/64,,0,0,,,,PENDING

    Therapeutic shocks generated by implantable cardiac stimulators, such as implantable cardioverter-defibrillator devices, may result in residual charges being deposited on the defibrillation electrodes and/or polarization of the tissues surrounding the defibrillation electrodes. These parasitic charges and polarization may mask a possible ventricular fibrillation of the heart following the application of the therapeutic shocks because such a ventricular fibrillation is characterized by intrinsic signals of very small amplitudes. A small duration pulse is applied to the electrodes right after a therapeutic shock. In addition, or alternatively, the electrodes can also be shorted together to dissipate the parasitic charges and the polarization of the tissue.

The WF muxing and demuxing processing can be applied for multiple signal streams with similar contents and format such as cable TV delivery systems or multiple signal streams with very distinct contents and format such as Karaoke multimedia systems. The stored or transported data are preprocessed by a WF muxing processor and are in the formats of multiple sub-channels. Signals in each sub-channel are results of unique linear combination of all the input signals streams. Conversely, an input signal stream is replicated and appears on all the sub-channels. Furthermore the replicated streams in various sub-channels are “linked” together by a unique phase weighting vector, which is called “wavefront” or WF. Various input signal streams will feature different WFs among their replicated signal streams in the sub-channels. The WF muxing processing is capable to generating a set of orthogonal WFs, and the WF demuxing processing is capable of reconstituting the input signal streams based on the retrieved sub-channel data only if the orthogonal characteristics of a set of WFs are preserved. Without the orthogonality among the WF, the signals in sub-channels are mixed and become effectively pseudo random noise. Therefore, an electronic locking mechanism in the preprocessing is implemented to make the WFs un-orthogonal among one another. Similarly, an electronic un-locking mechanism in the post-processing is implemented to restore the orthogonal characteristics among various WFs embedded in the sub-channel signals. Some of the phenomena due to the selected locking mechanisms are reproducible in nature, such as wave propagating effects, and other are distinctively man-made; such as switching sub-channel sequences. There are other conventional encryption techniques using public and private keys which can be applied in conjunction with the WF muxing and de-muxing processor, converting plain data streams into ciphered data streams which can be decoded back into the original plain data streams. An encryption algorithm along with a key is used in the encryption and decryption of data. As to the optional parallel to serial and serial to parallel conversions in the pre and post processing, respectively, we assume that transmissions with single carrier are more efficient than those with multiple carriers. We also assume single channel recording is more cost effective than multiple channel recording. However, there are occasions that continuous spectrum is hard to come-by. We may use fragmented spectrum for transmissions. There are techniques to convert wideband waveforms using continuous spectra into multiple fragmented sub-channels distributed on non-continuous frequency slots. Under these conditions we may replace the parallel to serial conversion processing by a frequency mapping processor.",CHANG DONALD C D;;CHEN STEVE,CHANG DONALD C D;;CHEN STEVE,CHANG DONALD C.D (2013-02-21);;SPATIAL DIGITAL SYSTEMS.

These replicated data streams are linked via a unique phase weighting vector, or “wave-front”, which are also linked by various spatially orthogonal wavefronts. Additionally, probing signals are embedded and linked via some of the orthogonal wavefronts. Aggregated signals in sub-channels are unique linear combinations of all input data streams. Post-processing via a wavefront de-multiplexer converts various sub-channel signals back to the original data streams, utilizing the embedded probing signals to restore orthogonality among multiple wavefronts.",CHEN STEVE K;;CHANG DONALD C D,CHANG DONALD C D;;CHEN STEVE K,CHANG DONALD C.D (2013-08-27);;SPATIAL DIGITAL SYSTEMS.

The receiver alternates between a monitoring state lasting for a monitoring period (45) and a sleep state lasting for a sleep period (46). A remote control is manually activated and a message sequence is transmitted to the receiver in response to the manual activation for initiating a function of the remote entry system. The message sequence comprises a plurality of blocks (35, 36, 37) transmitted at a predetermined block interval (41, 42), the blocks including a preamble block (35) and at least one message block (36, 37). If the receiver detects the preamble block (35) then it enters a reception state for detecting the message block (36, 37). The preamble block (35) has a predetermined preamble length (40) and is comprised of a plurality of bytes (50) separated by respective off intervals (51) between successive bytes (50). Each off interval (51) comprises a predetermined off period (53) greater than the predetermined byte period (52). The predetermined off period (53) is less than the monitoring period (45) and the monitoring period (45) is less than or equal to the predetermined off period (53) plus substantially twice the predetermined byte period (52). Thus receiver 'wake' time and hence quiescent power consumption is reduced, and by reducing the actual transmission time (because the preamble is broken up), peak message power can be increased without increasing average transmission power.",LEAR CORP,KING RONALD O;;MANSON NEAL RICHARD;;CHANG STEVE,,https://lens.org/116-222-815-983-125,Patent Application,no,3,8,7,413,0,B60R25/1018;;B60R25/24;;B60R25/24;;B60R25/403;;B60R25/403,B60R25/10;;H04Q7/18;;H04Q7/32,G4H HRBE          RCA;;G4H HRBQ          RCA;;G4H HRCA          RCA;;G4H HRCE          RCA;;G4H HRCQ          RCA;;G4H H1A           RCA;;G4H H14G          RCA;;NOT CLASSIFIED    NONE,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

Enveloped data are intended only for limited receivers who has access to associated digital envelope data files with enhanced privacy but with no or minimized redundancy.",SPATIAL DIGITAL SYSTEMS INC,CHANG DONALD C D;;LEE JUO-YU;;CHEN STEVE K;;CHANG JEFFREY CHIJIEH,SPATIAL DIGITAL SYSTEMS INC (2015-01-08),https://lens.org/063-793-489-494-147,Patent Application,yes,18,3,1,23,0,G06F21/6209;;G06F21/10;;G06F21/6245;;G06F16/13;;G06F16/116;;H04L65/764;;H04L65/762;;H04L65/611;;H04L65/765;;H04L65/70;;H04L65/612;;G06F21/6245;;H04N5/44;;G06F17/16;;G06F17/14;;H04L67/06;;G06F16/13;;G06F16/116;;G06F21/6209;;G06F21/10;;H04L65/70;;H04L65/611;;H04L65/612;;H04L65/762;;H04L65/764;;H04L65/765,G06F21/62;;G06F17/14;;G06F17/16;;G06F17/30;;H04L29/08;;H04N5/44,,2,2,010-976-413-704-338;;035-137-783-301-448,10.5923/j.ajsp.20120203.03;;10.1109/tce.2003.1209535,"SIDDARAJU, Multiplexing the elementary streams of H.264 video and MPEG4 HE AAC v2 audio using MPEG2 systems specification, demultiplexing and achieving lip synchronization during playback, 2010;;Skraparlis et al., Design of an Efficient Authentication Method for Modern Image and Video, 2003, IEEE, 10 pages",DISCONTINUED

   It has been found that casein and salts of casein are useful as replacements for, or in addition to, BSA as materials for coating solid phases, particularly magnetic particles, used in immunoassays and other binding assays for separation of the desired analyte. By using casein, immunoassays having improved stability and fewer discordant samples have been developed. Casein used at a concentration of 0.05-4.0 grams per gram of paramagnetic particle (optimally approximately 0.78-1.2 grams of casein per gram of magnetic particle) has been found to confer this benefit. 

   In addition, a process for coating solid phases has been invented, said process comprising the mixing of casein with 15 magnetic particles at 30-60 C. for 5-180 hours, said process resulting in casein-coated paramagnetic particles which either (1) already have combined therewith active ingredients needed in the binding assay or (2) are capable of reacting with active ingredients needed in the binding assay. 

   Furthermore, a process for using the casein-coated paramagnetic particles has been developed, said particles being directly or indirectly combined with active ingredients used in the immunoassays.

Wavefront multiplexing/demultiplexing process (WF muxing/demuxing) embodying an architecture that utilizes multi-dimensional waveforms has found applications in data storage and transport on cloud. Multiple data sets are preprocessed by WF muxing before stored/transported. WF muxed data is aggregated data from multiple data sets that have been “customized processed” and disassembled into any scalable number of sets of processed data, with each set being stored on a storage site. The original data is reassembled via WF demuxing after retrieving a lesser but scalable number of WF muxed data sets. In short, the WF muxed data storage solution enhances data security and data redundancy by, respectively, creating a new dimension to existing security/privacy methods and significantly reducing the storage space needed for data redundancy.

Multiple concurrent data streams are pre-processed by a wavefront multiplexer into multiple sub-channels or wavefront components, where signals from respective data streams are replicated into sub-channels. These replicated data streams are linked via a unique complex weighting vector (amplitude and phase or their equivalents), or “wave-front”, which are also linked by various spatially independent wavefronts. Additionally, probing data streams are embedded and linked via some of the independent wavefronts. Aggregated data streams in sub-channels are unique linear combinations of all input data streams. Generating redundancy for stored or transported data are options in the WF muxing process.

    It has been found that casein and salts of casein are useful as replacements for, or in addition to, BSA as materials for coating solid phases, particularly magnetic particles, used for immunoassays and other binding assays for separation of the desired analyte. By using casein, immunoassays having improved stability and few discordant samples have been developed. Casein used at a concentration of 0.05-4.0 grams per gram of paramagnetic particle (optimally approximately 0.78-1.2 grams of casein per gram of magnetic particle) has been found to confer this benefit.

Wavefront multiplexing/demultiplexing process (WF muxing/demuxing) embodying an architecture that utilizes multi-dimensional waveforms has found applications in data storage and transport on cloud. Multiple data sets are preprocessed by WF muxing before stored/transported. WF muxed data is aggregated data from multiple data sets that have been “customized processed” and disassembled into any scalable number of sets of processed data, with each set being stored on a storage site. The original data is reassembled via WF demuxing after retrieving a lesser but scalable number of WF muxed data sets. In short, the WF muxed data storage solution enhances data security and data redundancy by, respectively, creating a new dimension to existing security/privacy methods and significantly reducing the storage space needed for data redundancy. In addition, WF muxing/demuxing methods enable a monitoring capability on the integrity of stored data.",CHEN STEVE K;;CHANG DONALD C D;;LEE JUO-YU,CHANG DONALD C D;;LEE JUO-YU;;CHEN STEVE K,SPATIAL DIGITAL SYSTEMS.

This processing features additional applications for multi-media recording and data communications via transponding platforms including satellites, unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), or others for better survivability and faster accessing. Multiple concurrent data streams are pre-processed by a wavefront multiplexer into multiple sub-channels or wavefront components, where signals from respective data streams are replicated into sub-channels. These replicated data streams are linked via a unique complex weighting vector (amplitude and phase or their equivalents), or “wave-front”, which are also linked by various spatially independent wavefronts. Additionally, probing data streams are embedded and linked via some of the independent wavefronts. Aggregated data streams in sub-channels are unique linear combinations of all input data streams. Generating redundancy for stored or transported data are options in the WF muxing process. Post-processing via a wavefront de-multiplexer converts various sub-channel data streams back to the original data streams, utilizing the embedded known priori data streams as additional knowledge for reducing degrees of freedom to restore orthogonality or independency among multiple wavefronts.",SPATIAL DIGITAL SYSTEMS INC,LEE JUO-YU;;CHANG DONALD C D;;CHEN STEVE K,SPATIAL DIGITAL SYSTEMS INC (2015-08-18),https://lens.org/079-520-858-880-48X,Granted Patent,yes,5,0,2,5,0,G06F16/1744;;G06F16/1744;;G06F16/1727;;G06F16/1727;;G06F21/6209,G06F17/30;;G06F21/62,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The gaseous mixture includes a first gaseous composition containing tungsten and a second gaseous composition containing nitrogen and hydrogen. The second gaseous composition is one that does not have a gas phase reaction with the first gaseous composition to form tungsten nitride, unless energy is provided to the gaseous mixture. The first gaseous composition may be tungsten hexafluoride (WF ₆ ). The gaseous mixture may be infused with energy to form a plasma by providing it with energy from an rf signal. In the plasma, the nitrogen dissociates into nitrogen ions, and the tungsten separates from the fluorine. The nitrogen ions and tungsten then combine to form tungsten nitride (W ₂ N), which deposits on the wafer's upper surface.

A non-touching needle is used to paste a slurry on a heat-dissipation substrate. The slurry comprises nano-silver particles and micron silver particles. The ratio of the two silver particles is 9:1˜1:1. The slurry is pasted on the substrate to be heated up to a temperature kept holding. An integrated chip (IC) is put above the substrate to form a combined piece. A hot presser processes thermocompression to the combined piece to form a thermal-interface-material (TIM) layer with the IC and the substrate. After heat treatment, the TIM contains more than 99 percent of pure silver with only a small amount of organic matter. No volatile organic compounds would be generated after a long term of use. No intermetallic compounds would be generated while the stability under high temperature is obtained. Consequently, embrittlement owing to procedure temperature is dismissed.",UNIV NAT CHENG KUNG,CHEN IN-GANN;;CHEN HUNG-CHENG;;YANG CHIA-MING;;HSU STEVE LIEN-CHUNG;;KUO CHANG-SHU,,https://lens.org/167-691-240-619-243,Patent Application,yes,0,2,2,2,0,C09K5/14;;H01L21/4875;;H01L23/42;;H01L23/3736;;H01L24/743;;H01L24/29;;H01L24/27;;H01L2224/83048;;H01L24/83;;H01L2224/83203;;H01L2224/27312;;H01L2224/29294;;H01L2224/29339;;H01L2224/8384;;H01L2924/3651;;H01L2224/32245;;H01L2224/32227;;H01L24/32;;H01L2224/3201;;B22F9/24;;B22F2007/047;;B22F1/052;;B22F1/0545;;B22F1/107;;B22F7/064;;H01L2224/2919;;H01L23/3736;;H01L24/83;;H01L24/32;;H01L24/27;;H01L24/29;;B22F2301/255;;H01L2224/29139;;H01L2224/83908;;H01L2224/83048;;H01L2224/83192;;H01L2224/83203;;H01L2224/8384;;H01L2924/20106;;H01L2224/2732;;H01L2224/32245;;H01L2924/20107;;H01L2924/20108;;C09K5/14;;B22F1/0545;;B22F1/107;;B22F1/052,B22F7/06;;B22F1/052;;B22F1/0545;;B22F1/107;;C09K5/14;;H01L23/00;;H01L23/373,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
