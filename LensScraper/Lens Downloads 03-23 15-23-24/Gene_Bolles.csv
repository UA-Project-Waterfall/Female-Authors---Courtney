The mold has openings in each of the plates of the mold for accepting the stripper plate locking device. The device includes a release pin, a body member and a collet member. The pin has a shaft with a head disposed at one end and a first pair of camming surfaces with a shaft portion therebetween disposed at the other end. The body members has a second pair of camming surfaces with a cylindrical portion therebetween disposed at one end thereof and an opening therethrough wherein the shaft of the pin passes. The collet member has a plurality of expandable resilient fingers which define an opening. The collet member includes a third pair of camming surfaces with a first cylindrical section therebetween for expanding the fingers in cooperation with the first camming surface and the shaft portion of the pin. The collet member also has a fourth pair of camming surfaces with a second cylindrical section therebetween. The cylindrical portion is retained at the second cylindrical section when the fingers are in a nonexpanded position and is released when the fingers are expanded.",PRECISION PLASTIC TOOL CO INC,BOLLES GENE,PRECISION PLASTIC TOOL CO.
