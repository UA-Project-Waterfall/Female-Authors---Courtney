The water nozzle directs a substantially level water jet stream against an upright surface of the article as it is moved transversely of the nozzle. A transducer associated with the water nozzle transmits ultrasonic energy along the water jet stream toward the article, then receives echoes from flaws existing in the article. The gas jet directs toward the upright surface of the article a gas jet stream which is substantially parallel to, and vertically aligned with, the water jet stream. The gas jet stream serves to deflect the water splashing off the surface of the article after impact therewith and prevents the splashing water from descending toward and striking the water jet stream. The water nozzle and the gas jet may be positioned such that the longitudinal axes of the water jet stream and of the gas jet stream are both substantially perpendicular to the surface of the article being inspected. Preferably, the water jet stream exhibits laminar flow. Signals may be recorded which are received from the transducer representative of the attenuation of the ultrasonic energy caused by the condition of the article being inspected.

The three-way cock may be operated automatically in any suitable way, preferably by the means described below. The upper enlarged part of the pipe d carries a piston h connected to a rocking beam supporting a piston k working in the cylinder l. The beam is also attached to the lever of the cock e. When the parts of the apparatus are in the positions shown in Fig. 1, the compressed-air supply is cut off and the tank is filling, the exhaust air from the tank passing through the pipe f and exerting a certain pressure on the piston k. When the tank is full and the exhaust air ceases to exert a pressure on the piston k, the superior weight of the piston h causes it to descend and to open the air cock e, the other parts of the apparatus assuming the positions shown in Fig. 2. The water is expelled from the tank and forces up the piston h until the parts arrive in the positions shown in Fig. 1, when the actions described are repeated.",ABRAHAMS LOUIS JOHN,ABRAHAMS LOUIS JOHN,,https://lens.org/080-074-267-670-462,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   The invention relates generally to isolated leucoanthocyanidin reductase LAR polypeptides of the Reductase-Epimerase-Dehydrogenase (RED) protein family, and nucleic acid molecules encoding same and their use in regulating the biosynthesis and accumulation of proanthocyanidins in plants. The invention is further directed to isolated nucleic acid molecules of plants which encode leucoanthocyanidin reductases of the RED protein family. The isolated polypeptides and nucleic acid molecules of the present invention are useful for modifying the pasture quality of legumes, and, in particular, for producing bloat-safe forage crops, or crops having enhanced nutritional value, enhanced disease resistance or pest resistance, or enhanced malting qualities.

The decisions conform to data evidencing decisions that improved the state of the real-world system based on known input data. The real-world system operates according to open-ended numbers of and types of variables and is dependent on subjective knowledge about decisions about actions to be applied. Input data for at least some of the variables and subjective knowledge about decisions to be applied is unavailable from time to time. The data evidencing decisions that improved the state of the real-world system is incomplete. The machine-based method includes the following activities. The processor executes a first executable model using available input data to generate decisions on actions applicable to the real-world system. The processor executes a second executable model using the available input data to generate decisions on actions applicable to the real-world system. The processor executes a comparative evaluation process to generate comparative performance data indicative of a performance of the first executable model compared to a performance of the second executable model, based on the available input data and on the decisions generated by execution of the respective executable models. At least one human expert guides generation of a third executable model based on (a) the available input data, (b) the decisions generated by execution of the first and second executable models, (c) the comparative performance data, and (d) the subjective knowledge of the at least one human expert. The activities are repeated for additional iterations. At least one human expert selects one of the models for use in a production environment.
