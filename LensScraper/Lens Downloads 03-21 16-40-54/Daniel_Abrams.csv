The inventive neck bridge may contain one or two sections: a first or inner section to be placed within the aneurysm and an optional second or outer section suitably placed outside the aneurysm. The first section typically has a number of array elements which are intended to be resident within the aneurysm after the device is deployed from the distal end of a catheter. The optional second or outer section has one or more array elements which are to be placed outside the aneurysm.

It is a device which may be used by itself to bridge the neck of an aneurysm or used to stabilize the presence of other vaso-occlusive devices such as helically wound coils in that aneurysm. The included vaso-occlusive devices may be delivered to the aneurysm in a variety of different ways, e.g., by a core wire which is linked to the coils by an electrolytically severable or mechanically detachable joint. The vaso-occlusive devices may also be simply pushed into the aneurysm. The aneurysm neck bridge may also be delivered in a variety of ways, but preferably is attached to an electrolytically severable joint for its deployment. The inventive neck bridge may contain one or two sections: a first or inner section to be placed within the aneurysm and an optional second or outer section suitably placed outside the aneurysm. The first section typically has a number of array elements which are intended to be resident within the aneurysm after the device is deployed from the distal end of a cacheter. The optional second or outer section has one or more array elements which are to be placed outside the aneurysm. The array elements typically extend from and are attached to an attachment area, often centrally located. The inventive device is at least partially formed of thin, usually metallic, sheets.

   A fiberoptic network with an optical supervisory channel in each of the optical fibers interconnecting the nodes of the network is described. Together with IP routers, the optical supervisory channels form a control network over which signaling and control signals are exchanged by which provisioning and restoration operations are performed at each node. To restore connections between the nodes upon a failure of the network, the control network helps to maintain at each node a synchronized database of network connections between the nodes, send messages to other nodes to initiate restoration operations by a node noticing the failure; and recalculate network connections around the failure by each node from a synchronized database at the node.

The water phase is then moved through a heat exchanger (22) where its temperature is lowered to a subcooled level which is below the coolant operating temperature in the stack (2). A flow control valve (26) is associated with the coolant heat exchanger (22) to regulate water flow through and/or around the heat exchanger (22) depending on the temperature of the water which leaves the steam separator (14). By subcooling the coolant before it reenters the stack (2), a lessening of electrolyte loss through evaporation is achieved.

The water phase is then moved through a heat exchanger where its temperature is lowered to a subcooled level which is below the coolant operating temperature in the stack. A flow control valve is associated with the coolant heat exchanger to regulate water flow through and/or around the heat exchanger depending on the temperature of the water which leaves the steam separator. By subcooling the coolant before it reenters the stack, a lessening of electrolyte loss through evaporation is achieved. By eliminating steam condensation as a form of system heat rejection, system engineering is simplified and construction costs are lowered.

A flow control valve is associated with the coolant heat exchanger to regulate water flow through and/or around the heat exchanger depending on the temperature of the water which leaves the steam separator. By subcooling the coolant before it reenters the stack, a lessening of electrolyte loss through evaporation is achieved.

If the outer sectors were already displayed, those outer sectors become redisplayed to inner more sectors.

By combining the three novel notions of a ""role-preserving"" transformation ""shape-preserving"" transformation, and a ""register"" preserving transformation, a novel operation enabled by the present invention can be described. Essentially, the invention allows a pitch to be moved from one harmonic context to another. The pitches are then constrained to take on values that have the same harmonic function as their corresponding original pitches, while remaining, as much as possible, within the same register as their corresponding original pitches. Secondly, when a group of pitches are moved together as a melody, the operation can preserve not only the function and register of the pitches but the shape of the melody. Many instruments in the orchestra have a timbre that varies quite dramatically from the bottom to the top of their pitch range. A transformation which can preserve the register can be helpful, when applied to the parts of an orchestrated score, in keeping the timbral qualities intended by the original arranger. Further, when considering instruments with relatively limited pitch-ranges, preserving register is important to help ensure that the transformed part can still be realized on the desired instrument.",IBM,ABRAMS STEVEN R;;OPPENHEIM DANIEL V;;PAZEL DONALD P;;WRIGHT JAMES L,IBM CORPORATION (1998-05-13),https://lens.org/182-959-333-586-477,Granted Patent,yes,1,6,1,1,0,G10H1/20;;G10H1/38;;G10H2240/056;;G10H1/38;;G10H2240/056;;G10H1/20,G10H1/20;;G10H1/38,84/613;;84/603;;84/609;;84/627,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The controller includes a memory and a logic for storing the identity of individual packages containing contact lenses, predetermined as out of specification by the inspection station, and generates a signal to cause the first robotic device to discard any individual package identified by the controller as being out of specification. A second robotic assembly periodically transfers a second predetermined amount of individual packages from the consolidation buffer to a second processing station.
