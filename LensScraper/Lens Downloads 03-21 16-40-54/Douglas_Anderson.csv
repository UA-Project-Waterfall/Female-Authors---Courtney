    A voltage-controlled variable duty-cycle oscillator includes a current generator whose current Iref mirrored in three one-shots that each include two pair of series-coupled MOS transistors and a timing capacitor. The timing capacitor is precharged to Vcc in the first two one-shots, and to a lesser voltage Vcon in the third one-shot. The oscillator also includes pre and a post-NOR-gate logic. Output signals from the two one-shots are coupled to the pre NOR-gate logic to generate an intermediate oscillator signal whose duty cycle is determined by Iref and by the first two timing capacitors. The intermediate oscillator signal and output from the third one-shot are combined in the post NOR-gate logic to yield a VCO output signal whose duty cycle is determined by the ratio of the timing capacitor in the third one-shot compared to the sum of the timing capacitors in the first and second one-shots. VCO output signal duty cycle is a fairly linear function of Vcon.

    A foul line indicator for pool tables for identifying the foul line behind which a player is allowed to shoot a cue ball. The foul line indicator for pool tables includes a laser light mechanism which includes housing and a conventional laser light disposed therein. The laser light mechanism is disposed under a side rail and in a side wall under the second diamond displayed on top of the side rail and located from either end of the pool table. The laser light is adapted to direct a light beam across the playing surface of the pool table from one side to the other side to indicate the foul line.

   A voltage-controlled variable duty-cycle oscillator includes a current generator whose current Iref mirrored in three one-shots that each include two pair of series-coupled MOS transistors and a timing capacitor. The timing capacitor is precharged to Vcc in the first two one-shots, and to a lesser voltage Vcon in the third one-shot. The oscillator also includes pre and a post-NOR-gate logic. Output signals from the two one-shots are coupled to the pre NOR-gate logic to generate an intermediate oscillator signal whose duty cycle is determined by Iref and by the first two timing capacitors. The intermediate oscillator signal and output from the third one-shot are combined in the post NOR-gate logic to yield a VCO output signal whose duty cycle is determined by the ratio of the timing capacitor in the third one-shot compared to the sum of the timing capacitors in the first and second one-shots. VCO output signal duty cycle is a fairly linear function of Vcon.

The AC test signal is driven onto a first power terminal of the power port through a sense resistor. The voltages across the sense resistor are measured and scaled by first and second resistor dividers having different resistor ratios. The voltage and the scaled voltage at the first power terminal side of the sense resistor have a peak voltage being proportional to the load impedance of the load coupled to the power port.

First and second lever arms are pivotally mounted and biased against the first and second straight edges of the gauge plate, whereby displacement of the joystick knob causes displacement of the gauge plate and pivots the lever arms biased thereagainst. Follower rods extend from the lever arms to engage the gauge plate. First and second transducers are respectively operated by the pivoting lever arms.

A refuelling machine including a vessel 1 which may be pressurised to match the gas pressure in a reactor to which it is coupled by a flange 14 mating with a selected standpipe 6 depending from the reactor pressure vessel, has a fuel element magazine 9 with its compartments 10 arranged on an arc, the upper ends of the compartments being disposed on a pitch circle 11 and the lower ends on a pitch circle 12, the magazine rotating about the centres X, X of the pitch circles whereby its axis is slightly tilted. The fuel element feeding axis through the standpipe 6 is denoted by reference 13 and the magazine may be rotated from the position shown in Fig. 2 so that the upper end of each compartment 10 may be aligned in turn with the axis 13. The lower ends of the compartments 10 are always displaced from the axis 13 and the lower end of that compartment having its upper end aligned with the axis 13 is in alignment with a fixed tube 15 through which the fuel elements may be fed by a chain. The vessel 1 also contains a mechanism 3 for removing a plug 4 and door 5 and a hoist mechanism 8 for raising a charge tube 7 into the standpipe. The tube 7 is raised into position when the magazine 9 has the position shown in Fig. 2, the displacement of the tube 15 away from the axis 13 providing room for moving the mechanism 8 and enabling the overall size of the vessel 1 to be made smaller.

The oversize valve head has a seating surface (60) which rides higher in the valve seat (34) after resurfacing thereof. The seating surface (60) on the valve head (58) therefore rides higher on the new seating surface (66) in the valve seat (34). The oversize valve stem (80) accommodates a bored out valve guide (78) to allow a single size valve stem to be utilized. A keeper grove (84) is disposed on the upper end of the oversize valve stem (80) and dimensioned such that it is disposed a predetermined distance below the original dimension of a standard valve.

A thermistor senses the temperature of the laser and through a first control loop causes current to be passed through the TEC so as to adjust the laser temperature. As the temperature of the hot side of the TEC increases above the temperature of the cold side of the TEC, the TEC's cooling efficiency gradually decreases. This is compensated for by adding a second control loop which senses the TEC current and provides an additional gain proportional to the TEC current in the cooling sense. This additional gain is added to the gain provided by the first control loop.

ROWNSON, DREW & CLYDESDALE, Ltd. May 28, 1952 [June 7, 1951], No. 13577/51. Class 117 In an apparatus for grading fruit, of the type comprising diverging endless conveyers, the centre chain 23 runs on fixed guide members 24 and the outer chains 25, 26 run on guide members whose spacing from the guide 24 is adjustable by hand operated controls 27 ... 27c, and 28 ... 28c. On each chain the side plates 10 of each alternate link are bent outwardly above porting surface for fruit supports 12, Fig. 5, and and on either side of the chain to form a supthe side plates are also bent outwardly below and on either side of the chains to form ears 13 which run in recesses 16 in the guide members. The fruit supports 12 for the centre chain comprise hexagonal plates and are arranged somewhat below the level of the fruit supports 12 carried by the outer chains, but as the chains diverge the central chain may be deflected upwardly so that the central fruit supports are at the same level as the outer fruit supports. The supports 12, which are preferably made of rubber, are formed with chamfered edges and cooperate with supports on the adjacent conveyer to support a fruit at four points. Fruit discharge trays 8 divided by metal rods 50 are hinged to a fixed central support and supported by adjustable stays, the trays being lined with soft rubber. The machine is fed with fruit to be sized by up to six operatives from boxes of fruit 48 on platforms 6. Bad fruit may be placed in the middle of the fruit platforms on the central chain to be tipped over the end of the machine into a container. In an alternative arrangement, Fig. 6 (not shown) fruit falling through the conveyers is carried along by moving belts, and fixed ploughs spaced at selected intervals guide fruit of selected sizes into bins mounted at the sides of the machine. The bins are of known type and rotate as they receive the fruit, the floor of the bin moving downwardly against the action of springs as the weight of fruit increases. Arrangement having four diverging conveyers. Fig. 7 (not shown), may be used to size separately three grades of fruit.",ROWNSON DREW & CLYDESDALE LTD,ANDERSON DOUGLAS GRAEME FORDYC,,https://lens.org/067-636-026-852-979,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,B07B13/075,B07B13/075,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A method of making a conveyer roller of the kind which comprises a cylindrical sleeve 1 mounted by means of bearing assemblies 3 and 4 for rotation about a spindle 2 is characterized in that the bearing assembly is inserted into the end of the sleeve and both the cup 6 and the sleeve are deformed by a die 20 to lock the bearing against movement inwardly and outwardly of the tube. Inward movement of the bearing is prevented by a lip 11 on the periphery thereof. In a modification (Fig. 4), the bearing 33 is a pre-assembled unit and is introduced into a sheet steel cup 37 which has a lip 37a. The lower half of Fig. 4 shows the roller assembly before the deforming operation, and the upper half shows the completed roller. In a further modification (Fig. 5), a preassembled bearing is used which has in the periphery a groove 48 into which the sleeve is pressed.

    An infrared imaging system ( 10 ) includes a catheter ( 11 ). The catheter is inserted into a small passageway, such as a blood vein ( 23 ), in order to collect infrared information from the vein. The information is refracted by at least one lens ( 32, 46, 52, 57, 63 ) in a collecting section ( 17, 45, 56, 61 ) of the catheter, and is imaged onto the ends ( 38 ) of an array of optical fibers ( 34 ). The fibers transmit the information to a relay lens ( 42 ), which images the information onto respective detector elements of an infrared detector ( 12 ). The infrared detector converts the information received from the relay lens into electrical information, which is transmitted to a circuit ( 13 ). The circuit generates electrical data that is transmitted to a display ( 16 ), which displays a visible image based on the infrared radiation emitted by the scene.

The H-bridge controls switching transistors to create an AC voltage across the EL lamp. To reduce audible noise of the EL lamp when driven by an H-bridge, the current through the switching transistors is limited while the voltage across the EL lamp is rising and falling. This reduces the ramp rate of the voltage across the EL lamp and, as a result, reduces vibrations to an inaudible level. The rise time and fall time may each constitute 5%-50% of a half waveform. The rise and fall portions are substantially linear and symmetrical for the half waveform. Current may be limited by using two or more MOSFETs in the H-bridge that have relatively small gate widths. Current mirrors connected to fixed low current sources may also be connected to two or more switching transistors in the H-bridge, or current mirrors may be connected to the common nodes of the H-bridge, so that the transistors conduct a current proportional to the fixed low current when turned on.",MICREL INC,ANDERSON DOUGLAS P RITTER DAVI,,https://lens.org/099-012-032-418-066,Patent Application,no,0,2,4,4,0,Y02B20/30;;H05B44/00;;G02F1/133;;G02F1/1335;;H05B41/24;;G09G3/12;;Y02B20/30;;H05B44/00,H05B44/00,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

   A health club exercise records system in which members to the health club are given a handheld device that is pre-programmed by the trainer or health club operator to record different exercise activities. The handheld device includes a built-in numeric keypad, a display monitor, and optical reader designed to communicate with a compatible ID tag located on or in the vicinity of the exercise activity data source. Loaded into the working memory of the handheld device is a pre-programmed exercise data collection program. The exercise data collection program displays one or more sub-routines to the member requesting the member to input information regarding the exercise. The sub-routines are specific to the exercise activity data source and present one or more prompts requiring the member to input information. The inputted information is stored in a temporary data file located on the handheld device or transmitted immediately to a permanent member data file on a local server located in the health club. The system may also include an uplink terminal for transmitting the data in the temporarily data file to a remote server connected to a network operations center. A fitness tools software program is loaded into the server for collecting and processing the data in the member's permanent data file which may be reviewed by the trainer and/or member.

    An infrared imaging system (  10  ) includes a catheter (  11  ). The catheter is inserted into a small passageway, such as a blood vein (  23  ), in order to collect infrared information from the vein. The information is refracted by at least one lens (  32, 46, 52, 57, 63  ) in a collecting section (  17, 45, 56, 61  ) of the catheter, and is imaged onto the ends (  38  ) of an array of optical fibers (  34  ). The fibers transmit the information to a relay lens (  42  ), which images the information onto respective detector elements of an infrared detector (  12  ). The infrared detector converts the information received from the relay lens into electrical information, which is transmitted to a circuit (  13  ). The circuit generates electrical data that is transmitted to a display (  16  ), which displays a visible image based on the infrared radiation emitted by the scene.

An open ended annular mould has a feed end and an exit end and divider wall for dividing the feed end into at least two separate feed chambers, where each feed chamber is adjacent at least one other feed chamber. For each pair of adjacent feed chambers a first alloy stream is fed through one of the pair of feed chambers into the mould and a second alloy stream is fed through another of the feed chambers. A self-supporting surface is generated on the surface of the first alloy stream and the second alloy stream is contacted with the first stream such that the upper surface of the second alloy stream is maintained at a position such that it first contacts the self-supporting surface where the self-supporting surface temperature is between the liquidus and solidus temperatures of the first alloy or it first contacts the self-supporting surface where the self-supporting surface temperature is below the solidus temperatures of the first alloy but the interface between the two alloys is then reheated to between the liquidus and solidus temperatures, whereby the two alloy streams are joined as two layers. The joined alloy layers are then cooled to form a composite ingot.

A resource in the drawing widget is set to the sequence of invocations and when the corresponding window is exposed, the invocations in the sequence are executed to produce the elements in the window. The sequence of function invocations may include invocations for functions which add or remove elements from the window and which translate, rotate, or scale elements. Other features include the use of unit coordinates in the invocation and the use of hashing to reduce the character-string invocations provided in the sequence to representations made up of small integer, pointer, and floating-point data.

The apparatus is embodied in a drawing widget for use in the X Window System. The drawing widget permits users to specify elements in the window corresponding to the widget by providing a sequence of invocations of X Window graphics functions to the widget at runtime. A resource in the drawing widget is set to the sequence of invocations and when the corresponding window is exposed, the invocations in the sequence are executed to produce the elements in the window. The sequence of function invocations may include invocations for functions which add or remove elements from the window and which translate, rotate, or scale elements.

The H-bridge controls switching transistors to create an AC voltage across the EL lamp. To reduce audible noise of the EL lamp when driven by an H-bridge, the current through the switching transistors is limited while the voltage across the EL lamp is rising and falling. This reduces the ramp rate of the voltage across the EL lamp and, as a result, reduces vibrations to an inaudible level. The rise time and fall time may each constitute 5%-50% of a half waveform. The rise and fall portions are substantially linear and symmetrical for the half waveform. Current may be limited by using two or more MOSFETs in the H-bridge that have relatively small gate widths. Current mirrors connected to fixed low current sources may also be connected to two or more switching transistors in the H-bridge, or current mirrors may be connected to the common nodes of the H-bridge, so that the transistors conduct a current proportional to the fixed low current when turned on.",MICREL INC,ANDERSON DOUGLAS P;;RITTER DAVID W,MICREL INC (2006-04-11),https://lens.org/188-924-164-237-687,Patent Application,yes,5,6,4,4,0,Y02B20/30;;H05B44/00;;G02F1/133;;G02F1/1335;;H05B41/24;;G09G3/12;;Y02B20/30;;H05B44/00,G09G3/36;;H05B44/00,345/92,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   A method for evaluating the concentration of impurities in gases and equipment used in heat treatment of a semiconductor substrate is provided. The method includes processing a semiconductor substrate of known impurity levels in a heat treatment furnace, and measuring the impurity levels after the heat treatment processing by drawing together at least a portion of the impurities and measuring the concentration of impurities that were drawn together. In one embodiment of the invention, a gettering layer is formed adjacent one or more surfaces of the substrate to getter impurities from the substrate into the gettering layer. The impurity concentration of the gettering layer is then measured and the results are used to determine at least a range of impurity concentrations that were transferred to the substrate from the heat treatment process.

The frame (4) is periodically shackled to the car (58) and both are craned up several floors in the building as the latter rises. After the frame (4) is set in place, extra cables are fed off of the cable spools (14) via the payout sheaves (30, 32) to reconnect the counterweight (42) to the car. According to the method, before paying out of the spare cables (C) from the cable spools (14), the cables (C) are engaged by a hand break (34) to hold the cables (C) while unclamping said cables (C) from the cable clamps (28); and, during the paying out of cable from the cable spools (14), brake means (31) are used to control the speed and the smooth running of the cables (C) when the counterweight cable sheave (44) is lowered in the hoistway. When the counterweight cable sheave (44) has reached the remainder of the counterweight assembly (42), the cables (C) are reclamped to the clamping means (28) before the elevator car (58) is unfastened from the elevator assembly frame (4).",OTIS ELEVATOR CO,RICHARDS DOUGLAS;;ANDERSON ROBERT;;BENNETT PAUL,,https://lens.org/119-556-713-284-234,Patent Application,yes,1,9,7,7,0,B66B9/187;;B66B19/00;;Y10S187/90;;B66B19/00;;B66B9/187;;Y10S187/90,B66B9/187;;B66B19/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

    Soil microorganisms are obtained that produce a hemicellulase which is particularly useful in increasing the available energy content of hemicellulosic foodstuffs. These microorganisms can be cultured per se or can be used as sources of genetic information with which to engineer other microorganisms to produce the enzyme. Thus, commercially useful quantities of native or recombinant hemicellulase can be produced with cultures consisting essentially of microorganisms that produce the enzyme. The hemicellulase can then be employed in a feed composition containing complex carbohydrates which the enzyme degrades, enhancing the nutritional value of the composition.

    A stranded cable that includes a plurality of brittle load bearing wires and a means for maintaining the stranded arrangement of the brittle wires. Because the load bearing wires are brittle, they cannot be sufficiently deformed during conventional cable stranding processes in such a way as to maintain their helical arrangement. Therefore, the means for maintaining the helical arrangement of the stranded wires allows the stranded cable to be conveniently provided as an intermediate article or as a final article. When used as an intermediate article, it may be later incorporated into a final article such as overhead power transmission cables. The maintaining means may be a tape, an adhesive tape, or a binder applied to the stranded wires.

   An optical engine (15) for an SLM-type display system, which may be either a front or rear projection system (10, 20). The optical engine (15) provides for a high contrast, telecentric illumination angle to the SLM (33) without compromising brightness by vignetting due to offset in the pupil. The resulting offset pupil is converted to a telecentric, on-axis image by a relay path (34) between the SLM (33) and the projection lens (37). The relay path (34) places the image at an intermediate image plane accessible by a the projection lens (37), which permits the projection lens (37) to be telecentric without an offset pupil.

The full wave rectifier preferably uses silicon controlled rectifiers which are phase triggered in such a manner so as to control their conduction angles so as to control the power flow from the source to the load connected to the secondary of the transformer. The inductance of the load for the rectifier preferably exceeds the critical inductance so as to minimize ripples in the secondary of the transformer. This type of power supply circuit is particularly useful for supplying power to an electron gun which is subject to arcing. The inductive load for the rectifier reduces the transient voltages impressed on the transformer resulting from SCR phase control and also minimizes AC voltage drop across the inductive load while providing transient current limiting as may be encountered by arcing of the electron gun.",ENERGY RESEARCH ASSOCIATES,ANDERSON EMMETT R;;SCHATZ DOUGLAS S,ERATRON INCORPORATED (1984-04-02),https://lens.org/124-935-231-454-625,Granted Patent,yes,5,1,1,1,0,G05F1/38;;G05F1/38,G05F1/38,363/90,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

At least one input port of the neural network for receiving an input signal representing a condition of a process is included. A first set of data is obtained that includes a plurality of output values of the neural network obtained during a training period thereof using a plurality of first inputs representing a plurality of conditions of the process. The process/plant condition signals generally define the process/plant, and may include one set-point as well as signals generated using measured systems variables/parameters. In operation, the neural network contributes to an output of the PI controller only upon detection of at least one triggering event, at which time a value of the first set of data corresponding with the condition deviation is added-in thus, contributing to the proportional-plus-integral feedback controller. The triggering event can be characterized as (a) a change in any one of the input signals greater-than a preselected amount, or (b) a detectable process condition deviation greater-than a preselected magnitude, for which an adjustment is needed to the process/plant being controlled. Also a method for controlling a process with a neural network controller operating in parallel with a IP controller is included.",UNIV COLORADO STATE RES FOUND,HITTLE DOUGLAS C;;ANDERSON CHARLES;;YOUNG PETER M;;DELNERO CHRISTOPHER;;ANDERSON MICHAEL,PRADHAN ARUNDEEP S.

Adjoining end faces of the die halves are formed with nose portions 100 having inner anvil edges for effecting welding flash removal from the workpieces. In operation, the die halves are moved in sequence to grip the workpieces; to urge the ends of the workpieces together to form a cold pressure weld upset zone; to release the workpieces; to grip one of the workpieces; to urge the gripped workpiece axially relative to a pair of anvil edges to clear flash material from the upset to maintain the cross-sectional area at the weld upset zone substantially constant; and to re-position the upset weld zone centrally of the nose portions to repeat the sequence. Removal of the flash material intermediate consecutive weld upsets is effected in alternate directions.

   A method of forming a cushioning pad includes placing a component formed of polyurethane foam onto a first web of polyethylene foam. A second web of polyethylene foam is then placed over the component to sandwich the component. Heat and pressure is applied to the sandwich, which flattens the component and forms a seam between the first web and the second web encircling the component. If an unsealed cushioning pad is to be formed, a hollow needle is inserted into one of the first web or the second web. Air passes through the hollow needle and into the component, which absorbs the air and expands. Later, the needle is removed. If a sealed cushioning pad is to be formed, an insertion point of the hollow needle is in the seam, between the first web and the second web. After the component absorbs air and expands, the needle is removed and the insertion point of the hollow needle is re-seamed.

In a refuelling machine for a water-cooled nuclear reactor, adjustment of the machine is effected by water in an hydraulic mechanism in which the water pressure is higher than that in the reactor. Thus, no leakage of contaminated reactor coolant occurs and in addition the high pressure water of the refuelling machine is not vaporizable at the reactor temperature. The machine may provide a periscope and fuel element spray and consists of a vertical magazine having coaxial fuel element housings. The magazine is rotatable about the vertical axis so as to align a selected fuel element housing with a core standpipe. The lower end of the machine is telescopic and may be extended hydraulically into engagement with the upper rim of the standpipe to which it is sealed by an hydraulic coupling. The telescopic coupling incorporates knuckle joints to allow for misalignment between the magazine and standpipe. After re-fuelling, the standpipe is sealed by a closure urged into engagement with the standpipe by an hydraulically operated thrust member in the telescopic coupling.",GEN ELECTRIC CO LTD,ANDERSON DOUGLAS EDWARD;;GARTSIDE COLIN;;WRIGHT ROBERT ANDREW,,https://lens.org/059-642-913-936-74X,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,G21C19/22;;Y02E30/30,G21C19/22,G6C CPV           CPV;;G6C C22Y          GA;;G6C C220          GA;;G6C C23Y          GA;;G6C C232          GA;;G6C C236          GA;;G6C C238          GA;;G6C C24Y          GA;;G6C C240          GA;;G6C C25Y          GA;;G6C C250          GA;;G6C C322          GA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Servicing reactors. GENERAL ELECTRIC CO. Ltd. Feb. 29, 1960 [Feb. 27, 1959], No. 6935/59. Class 39 (4). In a reactor in which fuel element channels in the core are refuelled from their lower ends whilst the reactor is in operation the fluid coolant is arranged to enter that channel which is being serviced at a lower temperature than that entering the remaining channels whereby the mass flow of coolant through that channel may be reduced thereby reducing the risk of blowing a fuel element out of that channel during the withdrawing of a stack of fuel elements. As shown, the reactor pressure vessel 1 has a number of standpipes 3 (only one shown) depending therefrom, each fuel element channel in the core (not shown) having an extension 23 to which a swivelling duct 7 of a charging machine 2 may be coupled. The charging machine is as described in Specification 844,764 and has a charge tube 8 which may be extended from the charging machine vessel 9, a flange 5 on the vessel 9 making a gas-tight connection with a flange 4 in the selected standpipe 3. The duct 7 forms a continuation of a duct 10 with which a tube 11 may be aligned, the tube 11 being one of a number of similar tubes provided by a fuel element storage magazine. A tube 12 houses a chain which conveys the fuel elements from or into the tube 11 and along the duct 10. The chain may be as disclosed in Specification 893,487. A tube 16 interposed between the duct 10 and tube 8 extends through a header 17 coupled by ducting 18 to a water cooler 19. In operation the vessel 9 is gas-pressurized to a pressure similar to that in the reactor vessel 1, a valve in the flange 5 is opened, the duct 7 is connected to the extension 23 and a blower 20 is started. Gas is thereby withdrawn from the vessel 1 through the space between tubes 8, 16 and enters the cooler 19, part of the gas leaving through duct 22 and entering vessel 9 and part leaving through duct 21 and passing through tubes 11, 10, 7, 23 to cool the fuel element channel. The gas in vessel 9. returns partly through the space between tubes 10, 16 and partly through the space between tube 8 and standpipe 3. This gas provides a cool buffer between the cool returning gas in tube 10 and the hot entering gas and also prevents overheating of the standpipe and concrete shield 14.

The feed is constrained by the abutments to flow through frusto-conical exit apertures 10 in the shoe portion 8 to a chamber 6 and is extruded as relatively thin-walled, large cross-section, product. The exit apertures 10 have cone angles in the range 5 DEG - 45 DEG . Mixer plates 14 are profiled to distribute flow evenly from the apertures 10 to around the die opening 30. An extrusion die body 18 for cylindrical extrusions is located and axially centred by set screws 122. Where an even number of grooves 4 are utilised, an extrusion mandrel 12 may be secured to the shoe portion 8 by a bolt 22 positioned centrally of the grooves. Lubricant or oxidation inhibiting fluids may be injected internally of the extruded product through a passage 36, 38 extending through the shoe portion 8 and the bolt 22. In another embodiment, the chamber 6 is also of divergent frusto-conical form having a cone angle corresponding to that of the apertures 10, thereby enabling the extrusion of even larger cross-section products. The frusto-conical form may be of elliptical cross-section to achieve a requisite divergence or to accord with the configuration of the die orifice. By providing spaced apart grooves 4 and apertures 10 diverging frusto-conically it is possible to extrude products of relatively large cross-section since the volume feed rate is enhanced and the distance travelled by the material from the grooves 4 to the die orifice 30 is reduced, thereby reducing friction losses and the likelihood of discontinuities in the extrudate arising.",BWE LTD,HAWKES DANIEL JOHN;;JONES PHILLIP ANDREW;;ANDERSON DOUGLAS EDWARD,,https://lens.org/049-197-079-300-372,Patent Application,no,0,0,19,22,0,B21C23/005;;B21C25/00;;B21C33/006;;B21C23/085;;B21C23/005;;B21C25/00;;B21C33/006;;B21C23/085,B21C23/00;;B21C25/00,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The housing comprises one, two or more openings for the insect attractant light that is reflected and radiated onto the flat mounting surface. The housing and the source of insect attractant light can cooperate to form a light pattern directed in a continuous display pattern that can surround the housing. The housing openings further facilitate the entry of flying insect pests into the trap. As the insects enter the trap, they are immobilized on an insect immobilization surface mounted within the trap.

   An insect trap using attractant light, comprising a source of insect attractant light and a housing that can be mounted on a generally planar or flat mounting surface. The housing and the source of light cooperate to form a bidirectional or a multidirectional (overlapping or non-overlapping) pattern of insect attractant light. The housing comprises one, two or more openings for the insect attractant light that is reflected and radiated onto the flat mounting surface. The housing and the source of insect attractant light can cooperate to form a light pattern directed in a continuous display pattern that can surround the housing. The housing openings further facilitate the entry of flying insect pests into the trap. As the insects enter the trap, they are immobilized on an insect immobilization surface mounted within the trap. Cooperation between direct radiant light, reflected light and the position of the housing and insect immobilization surface forms at least two (preferably non-overlapping) light displays that can substantially increase capture rates when compared to prior traps. The trap can also display a light pattern substantially surrounding the trap housing.

Lower frequency radiation to be transmitted by the outer coaxial feed waveguide is applied thereto by a set of four waveguides of a launcher which launches a wave with a desired propagation mode into the outer feed waveguide. Each of the launch waveguides is initially a rectangular double-ridged waveguide for increase bandwidth. The ridging is reduced to a condition of no ridging in the outer feed waveguide by a transition to a single inner ridge which terminates in a tapered star-shaped combination ridge within the outer feed waveguide. Impedance matching rings are slidable within the space between the inner and outer surfaces of the coaxial waveguide for development of a desired standing wave ratio for accurate generation of a desired beam pattern.

The boresighting apparatus comprises a housing and a small arms weapon adapter for securing the housing to small arms weapons having different calibers. An illuminated or heated target is disposed in the housing for selectively providing an image of an illuminated or heated target pattern. A power source is coupled to the target for providing power to selectively illuminate or heat the target. An adjustment mechanism is provided for incrementally adjusting the optical location of the target and thus the location of the target pattern. A mirror, such as an off-axis parabolic mirror, is disposed to reflect the image of the illuminated or heated target pattern along a visual optical path. A beamsplitter is disposed along the visual optical path for transmitting visible and infrared radiation, and for reflecting laser radiation derived from a laser rangefinder disposed along a laser optical path toward the target. A laser radiation filter is disposed along the visual optical path for preventing transmission of laser radiation to the eye of a user. A folding mirror is disposed along the laser optical path for reflecting the laser radiation derived from the laser rangefinder to the beamsplitter to superimpose the laser radiation on the target pattern.",HUGHES AIRCRAFT CO,MLADJAN GARY J;;IOSSI DARYL R;;ANDERSON DOUGLAS A,HUGHES AIRCRAFT COMPANY (1996-01-22);;HE HOLDINGS INC.
