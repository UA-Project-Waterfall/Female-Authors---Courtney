A shuttle (39), acting to isolate or singulate an individual integrated circuit device (16) for transfer to a test apparatus, is included. A shuttle assembly (30) is carried by a splined shaft (34) for rotational movement of shuttle (39) carried thereby. The assembly (30), additionally, is moved laterally by means of a drive cable (36). Rotation of a shuttle barrel (32) and associated upward pivoting of shuttle projectiles (42) carried by barrel (32) effects engagement of a bell crank (70) which, in turn, engages a belt drive mount (82) carrying a drive belt (80). The drive belt (80), thereafter, is engaged with an integrated circuit device (16) to impel the device (16) out of a track (12) in which it is received. The engagement of the shuttle projectiles (42) with a shoulder (72) of the bell crank (70) pivots the belt drive mount (82), thereby overcoming belt drive mount biasing spring (90) which normally retains the belt drive mount (82) in its original position. A stop (60) associate with each track (12) is also engaged by upward rotation of the shuttle projectiles (42). Engagement of the stop (60) by projectiles (42) overcomes stop biasing spring (62) to allow the belt drive (80) to push an integrated circuit device (16) out of the track (12) and into the shuttle assembly (30). The shuttle assembly (30) is then moved laterally to a position in alignment with a chute (18) and shuttle (39) rotated to a second position where the integrated circuit device (16) is expelled from the shuttle by means of a spring (48) into the common test site chute (18).",MICRO COMPONENT TECHNOLOGY INC,ANDERSON RICHARD D,MCT WORLDWIDE LLC (2009-04-21),https://lens.org/101-657-215-744-145,Granted Patent,yes,5,5,1,4,0,B07C5/02;;B07C5/02;;B65G47/74;;B65G47/74;;H05K13/02;;H05K13/02,B07C5/02;;B65G47/74;;H05K13/02,221/233;;221/236;;198/463.4;;414/224,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

At high doses of ALA and a single high energy PDT treatment, permanent changes to the sebaceous gland and sebum secretion have been discovered.",GEN HOSPITAL CORP,ANDERSON RICHARD ROX,GENERAL HOSPITAL CORPORATION D/B/A MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL THE (2001-10-05),https://lens.org/094-860-134-717-120,Granted Patent,yes,49,85,17,17,0,A61K8/44;;A61K9/0014;;A61K9/06;;A61K9/08;;A61K9/127;;A61K41/0061;;A61K2800/81;;A61Q19/00;;A61Q19/008;;A61P17/00;;A61P43/00;;A61Q19/008;;A61K41/0061;;A61K9/08;;A61K9/127;;A61Q19/00;;A61K9/06;;A61K2800/81;;A61K9/0014;;A61K8/44,A61P17/00;;A61K31/197;;A61K41/00;;A61P43/00,514/563;;514/561;;514/814;;424/59,18,15,021-767-259-199-633;;027-533-530-611-848;;019-834-499-838-532;;095-881-533-126-482;;010-462-422-433-535;;086-067-593-406-723;;018-682-197-702-940;;095-725-934-124-002;;116-674-965-208-295;;050-807-919-398-239;;012-483-867-736-745;;039-522-435-222-547;;087-732-156-478-052;;016-904-746-796-010;;014-813-114-391-65X,8972644;;10.1111/j.1751-1097.1996.tb01868.x;;10951234;;10.1046/j.1523-1747.2000.00046.x;;10.1016/1011-1344(95)07268-3;;8765664;;6450810;;10.1111/1523-1747.ep12524813;;10.1111/j.1365-4362.1996.tb03274.x;;8850040;;10.1159/000246114;;9187844;;8687438;;10.1006/bbrc.1996.0937;;1655185;;10.1139/m91-094;;2935335;;pmc1577442;;9804337;;10.1046/j.1523-1747.1998.00377.x;;10.1111/j.1751-1097.1997.tb07963.x;;9188282;;10.1001/archderm.135.6.637;;10376688;;147054;;10.1001/archderm.1978.01640140039009;;10.1001/archderm.114.2.221;;8129416;;10.1001/archderm.130.3.359;;10.1001/archderm.1994.01690030091015;;1728936;;10.1056/nejm199201163260305,"Joris Kloek and Gerard M.J.

First, the surrounding louvers are circular and slope downward at their cylindrical inner and outer edges so as to deflect radiation outwardly of the shield and permit cooling by ambient wind. Second, these surrounding louvers along the upper surface are each provided with vertical convection flow apertures to permit natural convection currents. Third, the housing and the louvers are given a small spatial separation to prevent heat conduction. Fourth, a motor driven fan is placed at the top of the central cylindrical flow path. Air is drawn from the bottom of the housing at a screen-guarded circular opening. Air then passes around an aerodynamically shaped radiation baffle into the sensor chamber of the shield. Fifth, air drawn between the walls of the protecting housing is drawn along at least two flow paths. A first flow path travels along the length of the inside surface of the outer wall of the housing. A second cylindrical-shaped stream of traveling air provides cooling to the wall immediately surrounding the measuring sensor. Finally, a solar powered fan motor and battery circuit is provided with a resistor in series with the battery. The fan motor powering circuit enables increased aspiration during direct sunlight hours, limits solar cell charging current to the during sunlight hours, and finally reduces discharge current during non sunlight hours to prolong battery driven fan operation.

The level of processor and memory performance achieved is suitable for running applications that currently require cache coherent shared memory mainframes and supercomputers. The architecture combines new operating system extensions with a high-speed network that supports remote direct memory access to achieve an effective global distributed shared memory. A distributed thread model allows a process running in a head node to fork threads in other (worker) nodes that run in the same global address space. Thread synchronization is supported by a distributed mutex implementation. A transactional memory model allows a multi-threaded program to maintain global memory page consistency across the distributed architecture. A distributed file access implementation supports non-contentious file I/O for threads. These and other functions provide a symmetric multiprocessing programming model consistent with standards such as Portable Operating System Interface for Unix (POSIX).,ANDERSON RICHARD S,ANDERSON RICHARD S,,https://lens.org/130-973-540-596-840,Patent Application,yes,4,20,6,6,0,G06F12/084;;G06F12/084;;G06F15/17331,G06F15/173,709/213,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

   Light treatments of sebaceous gland disorders with 5-aminolevulinic acid and photodynamic therapy are disclosed. A preferred treatment includes topical application of 5-aminolevulinic acid to the skin followed by light exposures with repeated treatment at various intervals. At low doses of ALA and photodynamic therapy (PDT) in single or multiple treatments, improvement in the sebaceous gland disorder, e.g., acne, provides the discovery that diminishment in sebum secretion and the eradication of bacteria occurs. At high doses of ALA and a single high energy PDT treatment, permanent changes to the sebaceous gland and sebum secretion have been discovered.

A shuttle (39), acting to isolate or singulate an individual integrated circuit device (l6) for transfer to a test apparatus, is included. A shuttle assembly (30) is carried by a splined shaft (34) for rotational movement of shuttle (39) carried thereby. The assembly (30), additionally, is moved laterally by means of cable drive means (36). Rotation of a shuttle barrel (32) and associated upward pivoting of shuttle projectiles (42) carried by barrel (32) effects engagement of a bell crank (70) which, in turn, engages a belt drive mount (82) carrying a drive belt (80). The drive belt (80), thereafter, is engaged with an integrated circuit device (l6) to impel the device (l6) out of a track (l2) in which it is received. The engagement of the shuttle projectiles (42) with a shoulder (72) of the bell crank (70) pivots the belt drive mount (82), thereby overcoming belt drive mount spring biasing means (90) which normally retains the belt drive mount (82) in its original position. A stop (60) associate with each track (l2) is also engaged by upward rotation of the shuttle projectiles (42). Engagement of the stop (60) by projectiles (42) overcomes stop spring biasing means to allow the belt drive (80) to push an integrated circuit device (l6) out of the track (l2) and into the shuttle assembly (30). The shuttle assembly (30) is then moved laterally to a position in alignment with a chute and shuttle (39) rotated to a second position where the integrated circuit device (l6) is expelled from the shuttle by means of a spring (48) into the common test site chute.

The level of processor and memory performance achieved is suitable for running applications that currently require cache coherent shared memory mainframes and supercomputers. The architecture combines new operating system extensions with a high-speed network that supports remote direct memory access to achieve an effective global distributed shared memory. A distributed thread model allows a process running in a head node to fork threads in other (worker) nodes that run in the same global address space. Thread synchronization is supported by a distributed mutex implementation. A transactional memory model allows a multi-threaded program to maintain global memory page consistency across the distributed architecture. A distributed file access implementation supports non-contentious file I/O for threads. These and other functions provide a symmetric multiprocessing programming model consistent with standards such as Portable Operating System Interface for Unix (POSIX).,ANDERSON RICHARD S,ANDERSON RICHARD S,,https://lens.org/163-695-781-914-918,Patent Application,yes,1,1,6,6,0,G06F12/084;;G06F12/084;;G06F15/17331,G06F12/02,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The level of processor and memory performance achieved is suitable for running applications that currently require cache coherent shared memory mainframes and supercomputers. The architecture combines new operating system extensions with a high-speed network that supports remote direct memory access to achieve an effective global distributed shared memory. A distributed thread model allows a process running in a head node to fork threads in other (worker) nodes that run in the same global address space. Thread synchronization is supported by a distributed mutex implementation. A transactional memory model allows a multi-threaded program to maintain global memory page consistency across the distributed architecture. A distributed file access implementation supports non-contentious file I/O for threads. These and other functions provide a symmetric multiprocessing programming model consistent with standards such as Portable Operating System Interface for Unix (POSIX).,ANDERSON RICHARD S,ANDERSON RICHARD S,,https://lens.org/077-132-325-099-730,Search Report,yes,2,0,6,6,0,G06F12/084;;G06F12/084;;G06F15/17331,G06F9/50;;G06F15/163,,0,0,,,,PENDING

A shuttle (39), acting to isolate or singulate an individual integrated circuit device (l6) for transfer to a test apparatus, is included. A shuttle assembly (30) is carried by a splined shaft (34) for rotational movement of shuttle (39) carried thereby. The assembly (30), additionally, is moved laterally by means of cable drive means (36). Rotation of a shuttle barrel (32) and associated upward pivoting of shuttle projectiles (42) carried by barrel (32) effects engagement of a bell crank (70) which, in turn, engages a belt drive mount (82) carrying a drive belt (80). The drive belt (80), thereafter, is engaged with an integrated circuit device (l6) to impel the device (l6) out of a track (l2) in which it is received. The engagement of the shuttle projectiles (42) with a shoulder (72) of the bell crank (70) pivots the belt drive mount (82), thereby overcoming belt drive mount spring biasing means (90) which normally retains the belt drive mount (82) in its original position. A stop (60) associate with each track (l2) is also engaged by upward rotation of the shuttle projectiles (42). Engagement of the stop (60) by projectiles (42) overcomes stop spring biasing means to allow the belt drive (80) to push an integrated circuit device (l6) out of the track (l2) and into the shuttle assembly (30). The shuttle assembly (30) is then moved laterally to a position in alignment with a chute and shuttle (39) rotated to a second position where the integrated circuit device (l6) is expelled from the shuttle by means of a spring (48) into the common test site chute.

The level of processor and memory performance achieved is suitable for running applications that currently require cache coherent shared memory mainframes and supercomputers. The architecture combines new operating system extensions with a high-speed network that supports remote direct memory access to achieve an effective global distributed shared memory. A distributed thread model allows a process running in a head node to fork threads in other (worker) nodes that run in the same global address space. Thread synchronization is supported by a distributed mutex implementation. A transactional memory model allows a multi-threaded program to maintain global memory page consistency across the distributed architecture. A distributed file access implementation supports non-contentious file I/O for threads. These and other functions provide a symmetric multiprocessing programming model consistent with standards such as Portable Operating System Interface for Unix (POSIX).,ANDERSON RICHARD S,ANDERSON RICHARD S,,https://lens.org/164-791-438-177-195,Granted Patent,yes,22,8,6,6,0,G06F12/084;;G06F12/084;;G06F15/17331,G06F12/02,711/153;;X711E12005;;709/203,2,0,,,"International Search Report and Written Opinion, PCT/US2010/056717, mailing date Jul. 7, 2011.;;International Preliminary Report on Patentability from PCT/US2010/056717, dated May 15, 2012.",ACTIVE

The level of processor and memory performance achieved is suitable for running applications that currently require cache coherent shared memory mainframes and supercomputers. The architecture combines new operating system extensions with a high-speed network that supports remote direct memory access to achieve an effective global distributed shared memory. A distributed thread model allows a process running in a head node to fork threads in other (worker) nodes that run in the same global address space. Thread synchronization is supported by a distributed mutex implementation. A transactional memory model allows a multi-threaded program to maintain global memory page consistency across the distributed architecture. A distributed file access implementation supports non-contentious file I/O for threads. These and other functions provide a symmetric multiprocessing programming model consistent with standards such as Portable Operating System Interface for Unix (POSIX).,ANDERSON RICHARD S,ANDERSON RICHARD S,,https://lens.org/028-576-972-761-313,Patent Application,yes,22,67,6,6,0,G06F12/084;;G06F12/084;;G06F15/17331,G06F12/02,711/153;;X711E12005,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Tubes 3 and 4 form one piece which is rotatable relative to the hopper 1 about a horizontal axis and positionable by means of clamp 6 clamping upon rail 7. The two screws are driven by respective hydraulic motors 9 and 10 which are included in an hydraulic circuit in series, the hydraulic exhaust from motor 10 leading to the input of motor 9 so that the discharge screw starts a little ahead of the horizontal screw thus avoiding build up of material at the point of junction of the two screws. Shoot 5 is rotatable about tube 4. The hopper 1 may be positioned as shown upon the rear lift of a tractor or may be mounted ona carriage to be pulled by the tractor. The horizontal screw lies upon the bottom of hopper 1 and thus vibrates the hopper.

Record information contains data records (including roll back records) and/or commit records that together form database transactions. A commit record written to the AIJ file indicates that data modifications and/or additions embodied in data records associated with the commit record are durable in the RDBMS in that they are stored in a durable media and are recoverable. Rather than issuing I/Os to the disk based on a fixed timer or a fixed record count, the system writes to the AIJ file based on three workload characteristics: 1) the character of the record information received (data or commit record); 2) the AIJ file throughput, measured based on the buffer contents; and 3) the workload of the I/O device (busy or idle). The present invention avoids making a data dependent server process wait unnecessarily if the AIJ device is not busy, thereby improving response time without overloading the AIJ, and minimizes AIJ I/O in heavy workload situations by making the group commit size as large as possible without idling the AIJ device. The system adapts to a changing workload to provide improved response time and throughput.",ORACLE CORP,ANDERSON RICHARD;;ARUN GOPALAN;;FRANK RICHARD,ORACLE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION (2003-11-13);;GAIN INCORPORATED (1997-06-03);;ORACLE CORPORATION (1997-04-01),https://lens.org/111-862-338-469-29X,Granted Patent,yes,8,45,1,1,0,G06F3/061;;G06F3/0656;;G06F3/0676;;G06F16/2379;;G06F3/0676;;Y10S707/99956;;Y10S707/99952;;G06F3/0656;;G06F3/061;;G06F16/2379,G06F11/14;;G06F17/30,707/205;;707/201,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A financial document processing system for processing financial documents is operated to assist an operator during exception recovery. During exception recovery, an original codeline, an encoded data string, and a recovery codeline associated with a financial document are obtained. Any blank spaces from the original codeline, the encoded data string, and the recovery codeline are stripped to provide a stripped original codeline, a stripped encoded data string, and a stripped recovery codeline, respectively. A number of characters of the stripped recovery codeline and a number of characters of the stripped original codeline are compared to determine if there is a match between the original codeline and the recovery codeline. When there is a mismatch of characters between the stripped recovery codeline and the stripped original codeline, a number of characters of the stripped recovery codeline and a number of characters of the stripped encoded data string are compared to determine if there is a match between the original codeline/encoded data string and the recovery codeline.

Ultimately, a system has been developed that uses of low laser pulse fluences considerably less than those used for treating nevus of Ota on the skin. The system limits the risk of retinal injury by use of (a) a small exposure spot size and (b) a high numerical aperture (NA) optical beam with fluences of between about 0.5 J/cm2 and 5.0 J/Am2, significantly lower than many currently available laser treatments.
