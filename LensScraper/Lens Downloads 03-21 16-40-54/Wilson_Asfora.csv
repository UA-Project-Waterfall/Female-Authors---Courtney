Em vista dasdesvantagens anteriores próprias dos sistemas de estabilização decoluna conhecidos, apresentamos este invento que proporciona aconstrução de um novo sistema de união de vértebras que podemser usado para limitar o movimento das vértebras adjacente sefacilitar a união dessas vértebras. A principal finalidade da presenteinvenção,que será descrita a continuação em maiores detalhes, éproporcionado um novo sistema de união de vértebras que temmuitas vantagens dos sistemas de união descritos anteriormente emuitas novas características que fazem do novo sistema de uniãode vértebras um sistema que não foi antecipado, sugerindo ouinclusive baseado em os sistemas de estabilização e uniãoanteriores, nem isolamento nem na combinação deles. Paraconseguir isto,este invento geralmente consta de um sistema paraunir procedimentos de união de coluna de vértebras adjacentes dacoluna vertebral do paciente. O sistema consta de um aparelhoque comprime e estica a placa de união para se estender entreprocedimentos das vértebras adjacentes. A Placa tem extremosopostos e duas aberturas de interligação criadas na placa deligação, cada uma dessas aberturas estão localizadas perto de umdos extremos da placa de ligação, de preferência, pois essasaberturas estão localizadas no final da placa de união, com cadajogo de aberturas de interligação incluindo pelo menos duasaberturas. O sistema inclui um método para limitar o movimento dasvértebras adjacentes em relação a elas mesmas, e a coluna dopaciente, que inclui a formação de passagens, através doprocesso da espinha alinhando as aberturas de interligação com apassagens e passando um membro conectando através deaberturas e passagens. O sistema também inclui um método parafacilitar a união entre os processos das vértebras adjacentesincluindo a formação de uma interligação entre lados opostos daprimeira e Segunda placas e os processos da primeira e segundavértebra, e colocando material ósseo na interligação.
