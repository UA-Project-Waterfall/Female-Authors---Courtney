The coolant vapor is coupled to a condenser and in a loop back to the evaporator. A heated coolant reservoir is coupled to the loop for pressure control. If the wick is not wetted, heat transfer will not begin or continue. A pair of check valves are coupled in the loop, and the heater is cycled for augmentation pumping of coolant to and from the reservoir. This augmentation pumping, in conjunction with the check valves, wets the wick. The wick liquid storage capacity allows the augmentation pump to provide continuous pulsed liquid flow to assure continuous vapor transport and a continuously operating heat transport system. The check valves are of the ball type to assure maximum reliability. However, any type of check valve can be used, including designs which are preloaded in the closed position.

The sign typically uses a dominant hand for some signs and a second hand is used for other signs the dominant hand remaining dominant of the two hands. In order to encode the signs into a useful form, each hand has various articles defined. The first article is that of handshape for both hands. The next article is that of palm orientation, with location and movement being the next two articles. A parametric value is associated with each of these particular articles. A combination of the articles, such as an article's concatenation in a parametric value string, allows for the transcription of a particular sign. Using this parametric value or even parts of the parametric value for the combined sign, a desired sign or a group of signs may be identified that closely resembles the particular sign being encoded. From this group of signs, the user can identify the exact sign that is of interest or that matches the sign desired by the user. A unique total parametric value is defined for each sign within the given sign language for matching against any of the articles identified by the user.",SORENSON VISION INC,BAKER DAVID;;TAYLOR DAVID,SORENSON VISION INC (1998-01-03),https://lens.org/051-411-278-035-715,Granted Patent,yes,7,184,1,1,0,G09B21/009;;G09B21/009,G09B21/00,434/156;;434/167;;434/176;;434/178;;434/185,24,14,025-089-468-115-50X;;098-128-525-389-302;;068-181-822-364-296;;057-490-209-483-297;;091-931-810-328-291;;199-926-196-156-96X;;113-175-026-602-299;;199-950-558-808-997;;162-560-755-614-327;;034-234-458-045-274;;136-720-859-486-830;;024-984-501-345-142;;063-974-362-982-752;;108-527-021-215-260,10.1017/s0952675700000063;;10.1017/s095267570000004x;;10.1017/s0952675700000038;;10.1017/s0952675700000051;;10.1353/sls.1989.0027;;10.1353/sls.1989.0003;;10.1353/sls.1984.0014;;10.1353/sls.1990.0014;;10.1353/sls.1984.0009;;10.1177/002383099103400103;;1819682;;10.2307/416945;;10.1177/002383099103400102;;1819681;;3695760;;10.1177/002383098602900306;;10.1016/0010-0285(76)90027-x,"Baker, David S.

    A portable self-contained tracking unit includes an enclosure attached to a mounting plate, with a hollow interior cavity housing a GPS receiver, a microprocessor and a transmitter. The GPS receiver will receive tracking data and the microprocessor will process the tracking data into a data packet. The transmitter transmits the data packet to a remote receiving station, for transmission to a central database. Photoelectric cells are mounted on the enclosure to recharge batteries which provide power to the electrical components of the tracking unit. The enclosure is designed with a pair of vertically oriented side panels which are generally orthogonally oriented so that the solar panels mounted on the side panels will maintain a favorable solar incidence angle during a wide range of orientations. The transmitter is a cellular telephone with an antenna mounted within the enclosure but spaced a distance from the metal mounting plate and electrical components approximately one-quarter wavelength of the operating frequency of the transmitter. The enclosure is formed of a radio frequency and optically transparent material, so that the antenna and the solar panels may be housed within the hollow interior cavity of the enclosure. In the method of the invention, tracking data is periodically transmitted via cellular phone to a cellular service provider, thence to a data service bureau which sends the data over the Internet to the database of a central server computer. The central server computer will decode the information and provide an interface and value added products such as maps and reports for customers via a web page on the Internet.

    A cross-point shaped screwdriver has a cylindrical metal shaft with an axis coaxial with an insertion direction for driving a screw having a socket. A bit section, formed on the end of the shaft, has four blades. A circumferential groove is formed in the exterior of each of the blades. The grooves are in a single plane extending across a width of each plane. 

    When the screwdriver engages the screw socket, the grooves substantially align with a top portion of the socket. The grooves provide a clearance between the bit section and upper end of the socket top, thereby reducing wear on the screw socket and permit the driver to engage and drive the screw at a depth that the standard driver can not engage and drive upon. Often the screw is rounded out by a standard driver.

BAKER PERKINS HOLDINGS Ltd. Oct. 21, 1960 [Oct. 27, 1959], No. 36430/59. Class 87(2). In a process for making bread a supply of dough is fed to a divider panner, Fig. 4, arranged to form at least three pieces of dough at each cycle, each piece of dough 30 being of predetermined weight, and the overall length of the pieces not exceeding the length of a baking pan 15, Fig. 9A, into which the dough is deposited. A supply of the pans is fed past the divider 26 on a conveyer, or on a dead plate fed by a conveyer, the motion of the pans being arrested in timed relation by a pivoted air operated lever. In operation, dough is fed into a hopper 13, Fig. 4, from a mixer and a knife 27 is traversed across the hopper by a cam operated lever 31 to cut off a quantity of dough into the top box 25. A piston 28 is moved across the top box 25 to compact the dough and a divider box 26, having partitions 34, is moved simultaneously into alignment with the top box 25 so that dough is forced by the piston 28 into the divider box 26 until ejectors 29 therein contact a fixed weight regulating bar 44, Fig. 6. The divider box 26 is now moved to the position shown in Fig. 4 where the pieces of dough 30 are removed by the ejectors 29. The Provisional Specification states that as an alternative the divider may have four or more vertically disposed pockets into which dough is fed from a hopper by a pair of opposed horizontal rollers carrying a series of radially mounted knives, which reciprocate in slots in the rollers to feed dough from the hopper downwardly, the knives then separating to allow the dough to fall into division pockets, the knives also being reciprocated to close the lower ends of the pockets at timed intervals, and thereafter to open them to allow the pieces of dough to fall or be ejected into a pan.

    A method of commissioning an internal combustion engine controlled by an electronic engine control unit (ECU) is described. The method of commissioning includes an engine mapping function in which the engine is mapped at a combination of speeds and loads to build up a full set of engine operating parameters which are known collectively as the engine control set (ECS). The method includes defining a speed/load mapping table and generating a graphical display of a corresponding speed/load grid (  20  ) having a plurality of cells arranged in a grid, each cell corresponding to a particular speed/load combination in the speed/load mapping table. The engine is driven as close as possible to a selected speed/load combination (  24  ) and the value of a selected engine operating parameter is adjusted to obtain an optimum value at the selected speed/load combination. Each unmapped cell in the grid is displayed in a first visually distinct manner and each mapped cell is displayed in a second visually distinct manner. One cell (  22  ) in the speed-load grid is displayed in a third visually distinct manner to indicate the engine's current operating position. The method of commissioning may optionally provide for automatic balancing of exhaust temperatures for each cylinder of the engine.

Endless swing-tray conveyers. BAKER PERKINS Ltd. Nov. 30, 1959 [Dec. 5, 1958], No. 39243/58. Class 78 (1). In an endless swing-tray conveyer of the type wherein each tray T has a moving article-carrying floor formed by a belt 5 resting on the base 4 of the tray and passing around the edges 3a, 4a of the tray to form an endless loop, means is provided at a discharge position for tilting the tray backwards and at the same time engaging the ends of a cross-bar 12 secured between the ends 14 of the belt to cause the latter to slide over the base of the tray to deposit the articles by a "" peeling "" action on a receiving- surface R. The bar 12 is secured between the belt ends 14 by double hook members 13 and is carried between a pair of arms 10 swing- able about inward extensions 8 of the tray pivots 6 which are mounted in endless driving chains C. The ends 15 of bar 12 project through arcuate slots 18 in end walls 1, 2 of the tray between which base 4 is secured. An arm 16 carrying a roller 17 is secured to each projecting end 15. A second roller 19 is secured to each of the walls 1, 2 above the corresponding roller 17. At the discharge position there are provided two levers 24, 34 respectively carrying abutment members 21, 22. The levers are oscillated in timed relation with the chain drive by a cam 28 having cam grooves 33, 38 in which follower rollers 32, 37 on the respective levers engage. The arrangement is such that, as each tray passes the discharge position, abutment member 22 is moved forwardly from behind and below the roller 17 to engage the latter, and at the same time member 21 is moved rearwardly so that its rear face 27 engages roller 19 to tilt the tray, so causing belt 5 to slide around base 4 and discharge the articles. After delivery of the articles to surface R the tray is maintained tilted until clear of the discharge position by roller 19 travelling along surface 39 of the abutment member 21, after which it returns to normal position. The bar 12 is returned to its initial position by a plate 40 operating in conjunction with a disc 41 to form a guide funnel through which the rollers 17, 19 are passed. A spring 20 maintains the bar 12 in its returned position.",BAKER PERKINS LTD,BAKER DAVID KING,,https://lens.org/048-944-178-134-859,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,A21C9/08;;B65G17/36;;B65G17/48;;B65G2201/02,A21C9/08;;B65G17/36;;B65G17/48,B8A AGA           AGA;;B8A AP7           AGA;;B8A AP9           AGA;;B8A AR11          AGA;;B8A AT1           AGA,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The container with its capped neck is inverted and lowered into said sleeve and is guided thereby to position the cap over the feed tube. The hygienic cap has a recessed central portion and a relatively thin bottom portion (in said recess) which is pierced by the feed tube as the container is lowered into the sleeve. This piercing allows liquid to flow from the container to the dispenser. The feed tube, cap and sleeve arrangement is such as to insure a closely interfitting seal between the cap and the feed tube prior to the piercing of the cap bottom. This seal, among others that may be formed using the novel cap and dispenser combination, assures the hygienic dispensing of liquid from the inverted container.

    Methods and systems for configuring communication systems to access public telephone networks. communication systems, such as modems, that connect to public telephone networks are required to meet certain access requirements defined by the telephone network. The present invention provides a list of countries/locations to select from in configuring a communication system to operate with a particular telephone network. The methods and systems also include an import feature to address political changes such as the change of a country's name as well as telephone network equipment changes that necessitate modifying how a communication system and telephone network interact. Because political boundaries do not always indicate differing telephone access requirements, the present invention may also store a unique country/location identifier where the communication system groups political subdivisions together so that a configuration can be associated with a single country/location. The methods and systems further provide for the initial configuration of a communication system as well as for modifying the configuration of a communication system where the communication system needs to operate in distinct countries/locations from time to time. Depending on the circumstances, the present invention may function interactively or may be setup to configure a communication system without user interaction.

The clutch pack comprises a multitude of friction plates and steel plates, which are stacked one upon the other. The clutch pack further comprises a multitude of splines attached to the outer portions of the steel plates. The steel splines have rubber inserts attached to them. When hydraulic pressure is applied to the clutch pack it is compressed engaging the friction and steel plates and allowing the clutch pack to rotate, however, when the pressure is released the friction plates stay static, whereas the steel plates rotate. The rubber inserts facilitate a rapid release when the clutch pack is disengaged. When pressure is applied to the clutch pack, the rubber inserts do not interfere with the proper operation of the clutch pack.

   An improvement in a motor vehicle transmission/casing assembly where an end pressure plate of a clutch plate assembly, is positioned on a surface of an hydraulic piston located in the casing of the transmission/casing assembly. Spaced externally extending splines on the pressure plate are positioned in correspondingly spaced channels in the interior casing wall, for arresting the pressure plate from rotation. A loosely fitted buffer member or liner is positioned in each channel between the periphery of the externally extending splines and the walls of the channel for intercepting contact between the spline of the pressure plate and the wall of the channel. A groove in a circumference of the interior wall of the casing, supports a snap ring which transverses each channel and blocks the buffer member, positioned in the channel, from slipping out of the channel. The contact intercepted by the buffer member is absorbed by the mass of the buffer member and transmitted to the walls of the channel over a substantially large area than that of the contact between the buffer member and the spline, thus preventing damage to the casing wall.

    An improvement in a motor vehicle transmission/casing assembly where an end pressure plate of a clutch plate assembly, is positioned on a surface of an hydraulic piston located in the casing of the transmission/casing assembly. Spaced externally extending splines on the pressure plate are positioned in correspondingly spaced channels in the interior casing wall, for arresting the pressure plate from rotation. A loosely fitted buffer member or liner is positioned in each channel between the periphery of the externally extending splines and the walls of the channel for intercepting contact between the spline of the pressure plate and the wall of the channel. A groove in a circumference of the interior wall of the casing, supports a snap ring which transverses each channel and blocks the buffer member, positioned in the channel, from slipping out of the channel. The contact intercepted by the buffer member is absorbed by the mass of the buffer member and transmitted to the walls of the channel over a substantially larger contact area than that of the contact between the buffer member and the spline, thus preventing damage to the casing wall.

   The present invention is directed to wet friction clutch packs used in land motor vehicle's transmissions. The clutch pack comprises a multitude of friction plates and steel plates, which are stacked one upon the other. The clutch pack further comprises a multitude of splines attached to the outer portions of the steel plates. The steel splines have rubber inserts attached to them. When hydraulic pressure is applied to the clutch pack it is compressed engaging the friction and steel plates and allowing the clutch pack to rotate, however, when the pressure is released the friction plates stay static, whereas the steel plates rotate. The rubber inserts facilitate a rapid release when the clutch pack is disengaged. When pressure is applied to the clutch pack, the rubber inserts do not interfere with the proper operation of the clutch pack.

The control field of each information packet includes a bit which indicates whether or not there is a piggybacked acknowledgement. Acknowledgements can also be transmitted separately in control packets having no information field. Each acknowledgement consists of not only the sequence number of a correctly received information packet, but also the acknowledgement status of a plurality of preceding information packets whereby these can be negatively acknowledged if necessary. The sequence numbers can have any one of three different sizes, for efficient transmission of sequence numbers on transmission links of arbitrary transmission speed and length (and hence delay), The sequence number size which is used on any particular transmission link is determined on set-up of the link in dependence upon the transmission speed and the round-trip delay of the link.",NORTHERN TELECOM LIMITED,"DRYNAN, DAVID SCOTT;;BAKER, DAVID MAXWELL",,https://lens.org/112-481-794-550-363,Search Report,yes,1,0,12,12,0,H04L1/1628;;H04L1/165;;H04L1/1664;;H04L1/1671;;H04L1/1809;;H04L1/1809;;H04L1/1628;;H04L1/1671;;H04L1/165;;H04L1/1664,H04L29/08;;H04L1/16;;H04L1/18;;H04L29/00,,4,0,,,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH INTERNATIONAL TELETRAFFIC CONGRESS, Montreal, 9th June - 15th June 1983, pages 1-7; T.

The control field of each information packet includes a bit which indicates whether or not there is a piggybacked acknowledgement. Acknowledgements can also be transmitted separately in control packets having no information field. Each acknowledgement consists of not only the sequence number of a correctly received information packet, but also the acknowledgement status of a plurality of preceding information packets whereby these can be negatively acknowledged if necessary. The sequence numbers can have any one of three different sizes, for efficient transmission of sequence numbers on transmission links of arbitrary transmission speed and length (and hence delay).

Alternatively, no announcement is provided to the calling party, and the calling party simply receives a busy signal or an unanswered call indication. Once the subscriber is ready to begin receiving messages in her voicemail box, the subscriber may reactivate the voicemail system. If the subscriber does accept voicemail messages, and the subscriber receives and reviews voicemail messages, the subscriber may designate any reviewed message as “unheard” so that an audible or visual indication of the presence of voicemail message is reactivated to subsequently alert the subscriber or other user of the presence of voicemail messages in the subscriber's voicemail box.",AT & T INTELLECTUAL PORPERTY I,BAKER LA VERIA;;SCOTT DAVID,AT&T DELAWARE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INC.

A manipulator including cables is used for manipulating a testing head (62) for testing semiconductor devices. The cable trays (102) of the present invention are mounted within the manipulator within a cable housing (26) and are mounted on respective rails (16) allowing them to move longitudinally in and out with respect to the cable housing. The cable trays receive and support cables that run from a frame (2) of a tester system to the testing head. As the manipulator is moved to position the testing head, this causes the cables to move. In response, the cable trays independently move with the movement of the cables so as to allow for a full range of motion of the manipulator while simultaneously relieving compression and tension within the cables which reduces long term cable damage. The cable trays have a greater height with respect to their width so that the cables can more readily flex about an axis parallel to the cable tray height. The cable trays also contain a contoured flange at the bottom of each cable tray to prevent cable chafing. Further, the ends of the cable trays are tapered in length at different angles to maximize cable support while reducing cable tension during flexing.",CREDENCE SYSTEMS CORP,KHATER NABIL;;BAKER DAVID A,,https://lens.org/079-644-080-286-934,Patent Application,yes,2,0,9,9,0,G01R31/2887;;G01D21/00;;G01R31/2887,B25J19/00;;G01D21/00;;G01R31/26;;G01R1/06;;G01R31/28,,1,0,,,See also references of EP 0979389A4,PATENTED

Closuring containers. GLAXO LABORATORIES, Ltd. Feb. 16, 1955 [March 5, 1954], No. 6531/54. Class 125(2). In apparatus for applying adhesive backed foil sealing discs described in Specification 744,249 to the necks of vials &c. by the method described in Specification 748,843, the means which applies heat and pressure to the disc is so mounted that the heat-applying surface thereof is free to accommodate itself to the plane of the upper surface of the vial neck even though said plane be not strictly horizontal. The mounting may be a universal joint, a ball and socket, or a spring or, as in the embodiment described, may allow lateral vertical and longitudinal movement of the means. Vials are supplied between guides 5 on a table 2 to a station 43 one at a time. From station 43 the vial is transferred by a pusher 44 to a station 6 located beneath a punch 32. The vial, when in position, actuates a switch 57 which causes fluid pressure to be applied to a cylinder 38 to lower a plunger 37. This hits the punch 32 which cuts out an adhesive backed foil disc from strip material 10 and lightly presses it on to the vial neck whereupon the punch is raised by spring 34. Pusher 63 then transfers the vial to station 61 from which the previous vial is pushed to station 62, A third pusher 72 then moves the vials from stations 61, 62 to stations 7 each disposed beneath a pad 87 provided on an electric heater 85, the pad being loosely mounted in a supporting frame 82 so that it can rest evenly on the top surface of the neck of the vial. The frame 82 is then lowered so that the disc is heated and pressed on to the vial. The frame 82 is-then raised again and, when pusher 72 is next reciprocated, the succeeding pair of vials pushes the vials from positions 7 to positions 8 where, during the next cycle, the discs are subjected to pressure from a pad 81 also carried by frame 82. Pad 81 covers four vials. The various pushers and the strip feed are driven in the proper time sequence from a single shaft 27 driven by an electric motor. The strip 10 is sterilized by ultra-violet light from lamp 12 before entering the punch mechanism. The various operations may be performed while the vials are being carried in an arcuate path.",GLAXO LAB LTD,BAKER-CARR EDGAR DAVID STANLEY,,https://lens.org/153-347-982-903-664,Granted Patent,no,0,1,1,1,0,B65B7/2878;;H10K2102/311,B65B7/28,,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

Subsequently, when email messages are sent to the user, those messages are intercepted by the user's email service provider at an email server. A database lookup is performed for the keywords, text strings or email addresses designated as undesirable by the user. The email service provider does not deliver email containing or from the designated undesirable keywords or text strings and certain email addresses. The user may designate a return message to be sent back to the sender of the undesirable email to alert the sender not to send future messages to the user containing the undesirable keywords or text. If desired, in an effort to cause the sender to abandon the user's email address as a target for unsolicited and undesirable email, the email service provider may send a return message to the sender that indicates that the user's email address is not operable and that the email to the user is undeliverable.",BELLSOUTH INTELLECT PTY CORP,BAKER LA VERIA;;SCOTT DAVID,BELLSOUTH INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CORPORATION (2002-06-20),https://lens.org/081-492-277-699-208,Granted Patent,yes,7,37,1,1,0,G06Q10/107;;H04L51/212;;G06Q10/107;;H04L51/212,G06F15/16,709/206;;709/207,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

A manipulator including cables is used for manipulating a testing head for testing semiconductor devices. The cable trays of the present invention are mounted within the manipulator within a cable housing and are mounted on respective rails allowing them to move longitudinally in and out with respect to the cable housing. The cable trays receive and support the cables that run from a frame of a tester system to the testing head. As the manipulator is moved to position the testing head, this causes the cables to move. In response, the cable trays independently move with the movement of the cables so as to allow for a full range of motion of the manipulator while simultaneously relieving compression and tension within the cables which reduces long term cable damage. The cable trays have a greater height with respect to their width so that the cables can more readily flex about an axis parallel to the cable tray height. The cable trays also contain a contoured flange at the bottom of each cable tray to prevent cable chafing. Further, the ends of the cable trays are tapered in length at different angles to maximize cable support while reducing cable tension during flexing. In one instance, three cable trays are used.

Misalignment is induced by including a bypass which leads, during execution, to a legitimate location. During analysis, however, bogus data may be analyzed by the disassembler due to the bypass. Run-time modifications may also be included in code. Code is changed to an invalid state, and instructions inserted into the code which will return the code to a valid state during execution. During analysis, these invalid states may be analyzed by the disassembler as invalid instructions. Induced misalignments and run-time modifications can be chained together to produce sequences of code that will always produce invalid disassembly output from common disassemblers.",MICROSOFT CORP,MARR MICHAEL DAVID;;BAKER BRANDON,MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING LLC (2014-10-14);;MICROSOFT CORPORATION (2004-03-05),https://lens.org/188-888-284-281-169,Granted Patent,yes,10,4,2,2,0,G06F21/14;;G06F21/14,H04L9/00;;G06F9/44;;G06F15/00,726/26;;717/106,5,2,029-142-784-233-378;;001-293-221-196-309,10.1007/3-540-61996-8_49;;10.1007/3-540-47870-1_9,"Aucsmith, D., ""Tamper Resistant Software: An Implementation"", Proceedings 1<SUP>st </SUP>International Information Hiding Workshop (IHW), Cambridge, U.K. 1996, Springer LNCS 1174, 1997, 317-333.;;Collberg, C. et al., ""A Taxonomy of Obfuscating Transfromations"", Technical Report No. 148, Department of Computer Science, University of Auckland, New Zealand, Jul. 1997, 36 pages.;;Horne, B. et al., ""Dynamic Self-Checking Techniques for Improved Tamper Resistance"", Proceedings 1<SUP>st </SUP>ACM Workshop on Digital Rights Management(DRM2001), Springer LNCS 2320, 2002, 141-159.;;Linn, C. et al., ""Enhancing Software Tamper-Resistance via Stealthy Address Computations"", Work in Progress, 19<SUP>th </SUP>Annual Computer Society Applications Conference(ACSAC2003), Dec. 2003, 1-3.;;Wang, C. et al., ""Software Tamper Resistance: Obstructing Static Analysis of Programs"", Technical Report CS-2000-12, Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia, Dec. 2000, 18 pages.",INACTIVE
