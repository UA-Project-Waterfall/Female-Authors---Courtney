    A system and method provide the capability for a visitor to a home or business to leave an audio message for the occupants if they are not present. Outside the home or building, an interface may be provided which is proximate to a doorbell which a visitor may employ when notification by the doorbell has proved unsuccessful. Actuation of a switch on the interface may activate a messaging system which will retrieve a stored phone number and establish a telephonic connection over a telephone network. The telephonic connection may be with a voice messaging system which, in turn, will broadcast via a speaker incorporated into the user interface, a greeting recorded by the occupant. At the end of the greeting, a visitor may then speak into a microphone incorporated into the user interface, and record an audio message. The controller may further be programmed to establish a telephonic connection remotely located between the visitor interface and a telephone. Through use of the components incorporated into the visitor interface, a two-way line of communication may be established between the visitor who is at the home or business and the occupant who may be remotely located.

    A computer system in accordance with the present invention provides a method of communicating asynchronous events from a mini-port driver of a computer system to a software component without polling the mini-port driver. The computer system provides a monolithic driver as a dispatch between a mini-port driver and a software component. Until an asynchronous event is detected, an event thread in the monolithic driver to a software component is blocked. When an asynchronous event is detected by the mini-port driver, the mini-port driver calls the monolithic driver with a monolithic driver entry point which queues the event and unblocks the event thread. The monolithic driver provides the asynchronous event to the software component through the unblocked event thread. The event thread is then re-blocked and remains blocked until another asynchronous event is detected. Asynchronous events are thereby communicated from a mini-port driver to a software component without polling the mini-port driver.
