The device is to be used in the surgical procedure as a retractor i.e. to displace and hold internal organs of a patient away from the organ which is the surgical objective. The device, which is essentially a long thin narrow tube, is partially inserted into the abdomen of a patient through a tiny incision in the abdomen wall. Retractor action is accomplished by the movement of levers, slides or buttons located on the end of the tube that remains outside of the patient. These levers, slides or buttons control the opening or closing of components, such as finger-like protuberances, that depend from the end of the tube that is within the patient. These protuberances push and hold floppy organs away from the surgical objective so that the surgical team can clearly view the organ using the laparoscope and remove the organ with tiny laparoscopic instruments. In this manner radical incisions, recovery time, and scarring are greatly reduced.",UNITED STATES SURGICAL CORP,BAILEY ROBERT W,,https://lens.org/129-298-153-821-671,Granted Patent,no,0,0,7,8,0,A61B17/0218,A61B17/02,D41280111    M,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The device, which is essentially a long thin narrow tube, is partially inserted into the abdomen of a patient through a tiny incision in the abdomen wall. Retractor action is accomplished by the movement of levers, slides or buttons located on the end of the tube that remains outside of the patient. These levers, slides or buttons control the opening or closing of components, such as finger-like protuberances, that depend from the end of the tube that is within the patient. These protuberances push and hold floppy organs away from the surgical objective so that the surgical team can clearly view the organ using the laparoscope and remove the organ with tiny laparoscopic instruments.

   A generator and battery charging unit is operable on a wheeled apparatus, including rollerblades and skateboards. The charging unit is operable while the wheeled apparatus is used to provide fresh power to a rechargeable battery. A charging base holds one or more batteries for charging. The charging base receives electric current produced by a generator powered by motion of the wheels. For this purpose, a stepper motor is mounted to the wheeled apparatus and connected to the charging base. The stepper motor has a shaft that communicates with a wheel on the apparatus. The shaft is rotatable with the wheel to power the stepper motor and generate electric current. The electric current is passed to the charging base to charge one or more batteries in the charging base. In addition to the charger, the stepper motor may be connected to an output jack or an accessory to be operated by current from the stepper motor.

   A washroom device sensor uses at least one infrared beam that forms a longitudinal, rather than spot-shaped, sensing zone for detecting the presence of a user. The increased detection area of the longitudinal sensing zone ensures that at least a portion of the beam will contact a user using the washroom device. The beam may be adjustable in two or more directions to generate two or more sensing zones in different positions, allowing optimization of the sensing zone location with respect to a particular washroom device and the anticipated position of the device user.

   A device used as a toy or novelty item has a handle and one or more LEDs that are powered by a stepper motor that is configured to operate as a generator. The stepper motor is embedded within a protective housing element and is rotatably connected with the handle. The housing element extends from the handle and rotates with the stepper motor about the hand-held handle to generate electric current. The LEDs are electrically connected to the stepper motor and extend along the housing element. The device may be used as a hand-held toy so that the LEDs illuminate when the element is twirled or spun relative to the handle. The device may also be used as the handle of a jump rope. When the jump rope is twirled or spun between the handles, the stepper motors generate current which illuminates the LEDs to create an entertaining effect.

STANDARD TELEPHONES & CABLES Ltd. June 19, 1963, No. 24383/63. Heading H3T. A tunnel diode is connected in parallel with a resistor between the bases of a long tail transistor pair so that the conducting state of the transistors is rapidly reversed if the current through the diodes exceeds a given value. When the current in the highway C-C of a telephone exchange exceeds a given value the tunnel diodes D1, D2 switch to their high resistive state. This renders a transistor T1 conductive so diverting current from T2. The circuit may be used to operate a gate or an indicating device. The resistors R1, R2 by-pass leakage from other semi-conductor circuits so that the circuit will restore when the current being monitored falls below a given value. One tunnel diode may be replaced by a resistor and/or by a normal diode chosen to provide a sufficient voltage across the combination to ensure that the transistors switch, as illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, not shown, which relate to circuits using single transistors, not in accordance with the invention. If the tunnel diodes are reversed the direction of current flow in C-C and from VB may be reversed (Fig. 3, not shown).",STANDARD TELEPHONES CABLES LTD,BAILEY ROBERT EDWIN JOHN,,https://lens.org/198-053-939-095-103,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H04Q11/04;;H03K3/315,H03K3/315;;H04Q11/04,H3P PBNA          PBNA;;H3T TBNA          TBNA;;H3T T1CX          -;;H3T T1M2X         -;;H3T T2A1N         -;;H3T T2B3          -;;H3T T2T2N1        -;;H3T T2T2X         -;;H3T T2T3J         -;;H3T T4E1N         -;;H3T T4E2N         -,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    A clarifier in a sewage treatment process includes efficient scum removal within the influent well, with discharge of the scum and other floatables as a dedicated waste stream separate from return activated sludge and biological scum collected in the clarifier. In one embodiment the scum removal system has an inclined scum ramp at the leading edge of each of two scum removal troughs, with a forward edge below the liquid surface. The scum troughs pass through an arc of rotation, building up scum, which accumulates and is pushed forward by the scum ramp. At least once per revolution, the moving scum ramp approaches a stationary scum surface blade that extends partially under the liquid surface and provides a barrier to the forwardly pushed scum. This blade contacts and slides up the ramp, sweeping the scum up the ramp and into the scum trough.

   A clarifier in a sewage treatment process includes efficient scum removal within the influent well, with discharge of the scum and other floatables as a dedicated waste stream separate from return activated sludge and biological scum collected in the clarifier. In one embodiment the scum removal system has an inclined scum ramp at the leading edge of each of two scum removal troughs, with a forward edge below the liquid surface. The scum troughs pass through an arc of rotation, building up scum, which accumulates and is pushed forward by the scum ramp. At least once per revolution, the moving scum ramp approaches a stationary scum surface blade that extends partially under the liquid surface and provides a barrier to the forwardly pushed scum. This blade contacts and slides up the ramp, sweeping the scum up the ramp and into the scum trough. The described arrangement greatly reduces the amount of free water with the collected effluent scum as compared to the typical designs and permits scum and gross floatables from the influent well to be trapped and contained and discharged and treated separately.

Foam contained within the influent well may be treated with bacteria-killing agents or with anti-foaming agents. In one embodiment the scum removal system has an inclined scum ramp at the leading edge of each of two scum removal troughs, with a forward edge below the liquid surface. The scum troughs pass through an arc of rotation, building up scum, which accumulates and is pushed forward by the scum ramp. At least once per revolution, the moving scum ramp approaches a stationary scum surface blade that extends partially under the liquid surface and provides a barrier to the forwardly pushed scum. This blade contacts and slides up the ramp, sweeping the is scum up the ramp and into the scum trough. The described arrangement greatly reduces the amount of free water with the collected effluent scum as compared to the typical designs and permits scum and gross floatables from the influent well to be trapped and contained and discharged and treated separately.",ENVIROQUIP INC,BAILEY ELENA;;SHURTLEFF ROBERT,EIMCO WATER TECHNOLOGIES LLC (2006-08-11);;OVIVO INC (2015-01-01);;OVIVO FINANCE INC (2015-01-01);;ENVIRONQUIP INC (2000-06-09);;GLV FINANCE HUNGARY KFT.

Switches retained set and freed mechanically; retractive switches. ASSOCIATED ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES Ltd. Dec. 18, 1964 [Feb. 21, 1964], No. 7363/64. Heading H2B. A shaft 1 carries a sleeve 23 for rotation therewith but axially independent thereof and urged axially by a spring 24 such that two notches 28 (Fig. 1, not shown) on the end face 25 co-operate with a small wheel 29 to locate the shaft 1 with a snap action in a selected one of two stable angular positions. Two springsets 6 and 7 are respectively partly actuated by shoulders such as 27 and levers such as 31 in these two stable angular positions of shaft 1. A pin 13 moving in an arcuate slot 12 in support 11a normally limits the angular movement of shaft 1 such that only certain contacts of the appropriate springset are operated. If the shaft 1 is pressed axially (against the spring 24) the pin 13 moves into an appropriate slot 16 or 17 in member 15 (shown "" exploded"") which then allows an increment of angular movement of shaft 1 to cause the remaining contacts of the appropriate springset to be operated. When shaft 1 is released the action of spring 24 retracts the shaft to its initial stable angular position. The springsets are wired to a terminal block 10 (Fig. 1, not shown) which provides an internal sliding connection to terminals 50 on the outside of a fixed casing 49 (Fig. 2, not shown) in which the switch is retained by a releasable spring catch 51, 53.",ASS ELECT IND,BARROW NORMAN;;BAILEY WALTER ROBERT,,https://lens.org/078-889-726-233-444,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,H01H13/023;;H01H25/06,H01H13/02;;H01H25/06,H1N NGA           NGA;;H1N NGAB          NGAB;;H1N N442          FM;;H1N N446          FM;;H1N N446          NGAB;;H1N N45X          FM;;H1N N45Y          FM;;H1N N451          FM;;H1N N451          NGAB;;H1N N541          FM;;H1N N541          NGAB;;H1N N562          FM;;H1N N569          NGAB;;H1N N60X          FM;;H1N N60X          NGAB;;H1N N611          FM;;H1N N611          NGAB;;H1N N638          FM;;H1N N639          NGAB;;H1N N649          FM;;H1N N649          NGAB;;H1N N703          FM;;H1N N703          NGAB;;H1N N734          FM;;H1N N734          NGAB;;H1N N735          FM;;H1N N735          NGAB;;H1N N74X          FM;;H1N N74X          NGAB;;H1N N744          FM;;H1N N744          NGAB;;H1N N747          FM;;H1N N747          NGAB;;H1N N853          NGAB;;H1N N854          NGAB;;H1N N871          NGAB,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A driven member is positioned in accordance with the condition of switch means SSW by means including switching means PSW controlled by the driven member to represent the actual position, a winding II of an electromagnet 27 being energized via the switching means SSW, PSW when the desired position is reached, thus causing a latch to engage a notched wheel to prevent further movement of the driven member, the electromagnet 27 having a second winding I which is energized throughout. In a first embodiment (Figs. 1-10, not all shown), four of the above systems are provided to control a train arrival/departure time indicating device, movable belts or film 21A-D, bearing a single column of numerals each,being the driven members. Each of belts 21A-D is driven by a sprocket wheel and a toothless wheel each driven via an individual felt friction pad from a driving shaft common to all the belts. Engagement of the latch with the notched wheel in the case of any belt causes the associated two friction pads to slip. While a given belt is moving, a cam driven with it operates contacts 28, e.g. 28c, to supply stepping pulses to step switching means PSW. A number of the indicating devices described above may be mounted in a rack by pins e.g. 8, 10 (Fig. 1) and all driven by a common chain engaging sprocket wheels 13 (Fig. 1). Figs. 11-16 (only 12 shown) show a second embodiment in which an indicating device comprises a single hexagonal drum 54 comprising three detachable slats 70, each having a pin 72 to fit into one end plate of the drum, a three-fingered spring 75 (Fig. 13, not shown) supporting the other ends of the slats 70. An external sprocket wheel (like 13 of Fig. 1) is coupled directly to the shaft 55 of the drum via a friction pad, and the moving contact arm of the switching means corresponding to PSW is driven directly on shaft 55.",ASS ELECT IND,BARROW NORMAN;;BAILEY WALTER ROBERT,,https://lens.org/042-126-467-890-412,Granted Patent,no,0,0,1,1,0,F16D71/04;;G04C17/0008,F16D71/04;;G04C17/00,G4H HS1           S1;;G5C CCC           CCC;;G5C CCH           CCH;;G5C C502          CCH;;G5C C611          CCC,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

A video integrated circuit 14 is coupled to the RAM 43 to provide N bits of video data per pixel to the display at a dot clock rate consistent with the requirements of the display. This video circuit 14, rather than having its own video RAM, shares the system memory (i.e., RAM) with the CPU. A memory controller 12 arbitrates access to the RAM between the CPU and the video circuit in a manner that denies access to the RAM by the CPU whenever the video circuit is reading video data from the RAM. All of the video circuitry is incorporated on a single printed circuit board with the rest of the computer circuitry, thereby obviating the need for a separate video card with its own expensive video RAM, and permitting access to the video data at a substantially faster rate than that of past systems. <IMAGE>",APPLE COMPUTER,BAILEY ROBERT;;HOWARD BRIAN D,,https://lens.org/048-533-863-416-479,Patent Application,no,7,4,9,9,0,G09G5/001;;G09G5/36;;G09G2360/125;;G09G5/001;;G09G5/36;;G09G2360/125,G06F13/18;;G06F3/153;;G09G1/16;;G09G5/00;;G09G5/36;;G09G5/39,G4A AMB           MB;;U1S S2284,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

    An arbiter arbitrates between PCI agents within an ASIC. The ASIC interfaces with an external PCI bus. In operation, the arbiter receives request signals from the PCI agents, and in response thereto, generates a single external request signal. Once the grant is received by the ASIC, the arbiter will route it to a selected PCI agent. The selected agent then gains access to the PCI bus and all other agents are locked out until the transaction is completed. The arbiter is implemented in such a way that there is a minium delay between the generation of the request by any agent and the request sent out by the ASIC. This is performed by ORing all requests.

An upper filtering screen (88) extends generally horizontally and serves to separate out the larger particles from the rest. The slurry which passes down to the lower screen (90) (of finer mesh than the upper screen) is further filtered and a mud-like residue of particulate material slowly accumulates on the lower screen (90) and migrates up the screen--to be discharged at the upper outlet end thereof, while liquid material filters through the screen to be recovered in a sump below. The drive (14, 16) for the machine comprises two pairs of rotating clump weights, mounted with their individual motors on a platform which spans the basket within which the screens are fitted.

Modified epoxy resins; addition polymer compositions. DOW CHEMICAL CO. 27 June, 1967, No. 29650/67. Headings C3B and C3P. [Also in Division B2] A thermosettable liquid coating vehicle is prepared by first reacting at least one epoxy resin with at least one alkanolamine to give an adduct which is further reacted in the presence of a liquid which is sufficiently volatile to take part in spray coating processes with a waterinsoluble film-forming polymer containing free carboxyl and/or carboxylic acid anhydride groups. The latter may be an alkyd resin having an acid number from 20 to 175 or a vinyl addition polymer having up to 1 g. equivalent weight of carboxylic acid groups per 100 g. of polymer. From 0À7 to 1À5 moles of alkanolamine may be reacted with each equivalent weight of epoxy resin in the first stage. In the second stage the alkanolamine-epoxy resin adduct may be reacted with the free carboxyl group containing polymer in proportions so as to provide from 0À2 to 2 equivalents of alkanolamine per equivalent weight of carboxylic acid. The alkanolamine, which may be ethanolamine, diethanolamine, isopropylamine, diisopropylamine or mixtures thereof may be volatile at the temperature used in the thermosetting reaction. The epoxy resin may be any of the conventional commercially available resins especially the diglycidyl ethers of 1,8-bis-(hydroxyphenyl)-pentadecane and of 2,2-bis-(hydroxyphenyl) propane. The solvent used may be xylene, methyl ethyl ketone, ethyl acetate, butanol, propanol or water; when water is used the film-forming polymer is in the form of an emulsion.

The general form of the construction is similar to that of the VSM100 shaker machine as supplied by the applicant company, but significant differences in the design and construction of the new unit allow a higher throughput of mud to be accommodated. An upper filtering screen (88) extends generally horizontally and serves to separate out the larger particles from the rest. The slurry which passes down to the lower screen (90) (of finer mesh than the upper screen) is further filtered and a mud-like residue of particulate material slowly accumulates on the lower screen (90) and migrates up the screen - to be discharged at the upper outlet end thereof, while liquid material filters through the screen to be recovered in a sump below. The drive (14, 16) for the machine comprises two pairs of rotating clump weights, mounted with their individual motors on a platform which spans the basket within which the screens are fitted. The two pairs of clump weights occupy a plane which is generally parallel to the upper (horizontal) screen (88), close to the latter, so keeping the centre of gravity low, which enhances the vibration characteristics of the system.",RIG TECHNOLOGY LTD;;BAILEY ARTHUR ROBERT;;BURNETT GEORGE ALEXANDER,BAILEY ARTHUR ROBERT;;BURNETT GEORGE ALEXANDER,,https://lens.org/027-352-371-720-365,Patent Application,yes,11,47,11,23,0,B07B1/46;;B01D33/0346;;B01D33/41;;B01D33/76;;B01D33/763;;B07B1/284;;B07B1/42,B01D33/03;;B07B1/28;;B07B1/42;;B07B1/46,,0,0,,,,PATENTED

Nov. 8, 1963 [Aug. 8, 1962], No. 30459/62. Heading G1N. [Also in Division G3] The thickness of a strip 10, Fig. 1, (e.g. in a rolling mill) is measured by passing it between two rollers 12a, 12b which are biased towards the strip, movement of each roller perpendicular to the strip being used to rotate the rotor of a synchro device 14a, 14b, the rollers and synchros being mounted on a floating unit (20, Fig. 2 not shown) so that random lateral displacements of the moving strip cause one roller to engage a stop (27) and thereby move the whole unit (20) so that the unit is prevented from exerting a lateral force on the strip. The stator windings of the two synchros are interconnected either directly, in which case the difference in magnitude between the A.C. applied to the rotor of 14a Fig. 1, and that supplied from the rotor of 14b indicates the actual strip thickness, or else they are interconnected via a differential transformer 15 which introduces an angular displacement between the two stator fields and thus sets a datum strip thickness, any output from a phase sensitive comparator 16 then representing deviations from the required thickness. These deviations may be indicated, or else amplified (17) and used to control a motor 18 which adjusts the gap between the main rollers 11. The sensing rollers, which may be of ceramic or vitreous material, are mounted in C-shaped members 22, Figs. 2-4 (not shown) on the floating unit (20) which is resiliently mounted by arms (21) on a fixed base member (19) attached to the mill. Rotational movement of the C-shaped roller-holders (22) is transmitted by precision gear-boxes (24) to the synchro.",ENGLISH ELECTRIC CO LTD,BROWNING SHANE CAIRNES;;BAILEY ROBERT ALEXANDER,,https://lens.org/142-905-035-121-810,Granted Patent,no,0,2,1,1,0,G01B7/107,G01B7/06,G1N NAGD          AGD10;;G1N NAGD10        AGD10;;G1N N1A5A         AGD10;;G1N N1C           AGD10;;G1N N1D7          AGD10;;G1N N1M           AGD10;;G1N N3S1A         AGD10;;G1N N4C           AGD10;;G1N N7N           AGD10;;G3R RCC           CC;;G3R RCC           CC/274;;G3R RC243         CC;;G3R RC243         CC/274;;G3R RC258         CC;;G3R RC258         CC/274;;G3R RC274         CC;;G3R RC274         CC/274;;G3R R4            -;;G3R R51A          R51A;;G3R R51D          R51A;;G3R R51G          R51A,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

The rail-like magnetic boundaries have the same polarity as the bubbles. When the path is full of bubbles, the introduction of a single bubble or other magnetic impulse at one end of the path instantaneously causes the ejection of another bubble at the opposite end of the path due to bubble-bubble interaction. In one embodiment the magnetic boundaries are formed by permalloy rails on which strip domains form. In another embodiment, lines of permalloy dots form ""fence posts"" for fixed fence bubbles. The same technique is applied to implement an instantaneous crossover of two bubble tracks. In addition, the magnetic boundaries can be used to bias the confined bubbles thus influencing their size.",MONSANTO CO,MINNICK ROBERT C;;BAILEY PAUL T;;SANDFORT ROBERT M,,https://lens.org/194-740-060-183-646,Granted Patent,no,9,3,1,1,0,G11C19/0833;;G11C19/0833,G11C19/08,340174TF,0,0,,,,EXPIRED

These changes are the changes in the aggregate blood layer thickness within a given tissue volume calculating by using a modified Beer-Lambert for the time varying changes in the diastolic and systolic phases, where the calculation is logarithmically proportional to the intensity of the excitation light that excites the fluorescence agent, multiplied by the quantum efficiency of the fluorescent agent and when taken into account the time varying light intensity signal during the diastolic phase minimum scaled by the said intensity and quantum efficiency and when also is subtracted the intensity of time-varying light intensity during the systolic phase maximum of the pulsatile flow, all of that scaled by the multiplication of a molar coefficient of the fluorescent agent and the instantaneous molar concentration of the fluorescence agent in the blood. The instantaneous molar concentration of the fluorescence agent is determined by utilizing a concentration-mediated change in a fluorescence emission spectrum of the fluorescence agent.

Brightmore, A. W., and Bailey, R. W. H. Aug. 9. Motor road vehicles.- Relates to steering and driving gear of motor load vehicles of the kind wherein the front road wheels are both steering and driving wheels and carry a swivelling fore-carriage such as described in Specifications No. 7250, A.D. 1897, and No. 4584, A.D. 1901. The invention consists in effecting the driving and steering by means of differential gear and braking the final units of the gear as required to produce a sensitive and steady steering action. The steadying- brake may be applied between the swivelling fore-carriage and the vehicle body, or elsewhere. In the form shown in Fig. 3, the two parts 6, 7 of the driving-shaft are driven by differential gearing 16, 17, 18, and either one or the other can be checked by brake-drums 12, 13 according to the direction in which the vehicie is required to move. To prevent over-sensitiveness in the steering action, a steadying- brake device 31, 35 is interposed between the parts 6, 7 of the shaft. In this, the pressure of each of the brake shoes 32 is adjustable by a screw acting through a spring. In the form shown in Fig. 2, motion is communicated from the shaft 6 to the sprocket pinions 10, 11 through bevel gear, in which the frames carrying the pinions 18, 19 can be held stationary by brake drums 12, 13 or allowed to travel slowly for steering purposes. Instead of brake drums, worms and worm-wheels may be used.",BRIGHTMORE ARTHUR WILLIAM;;BAILEY ROBERT WILLIAM HARVEY,BRIGHTMORE ARTHUR WILLIAM;;BAILEY ROBERT WILLIAM HARVEY,,https://lens.org/037-650-975-402-008,Patent Application,no,0,0,1,1,0,,,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

With molecular oxygen as a stable species source of oxide, and hydrogen as the in situ radical generating reactant, oxide films of silicon are readily produced with a silicon-containing precursor introduced into the reactor.",AVIZA TECH INC,TREICHEL HELMUTH;;QIU TAIQING;;BAILEY ROBERT JEFFREY,,https://lens.org/158-520-794-075-337,Patent of Addition,no,0,2,5,5,0,C23C16/401;;C23C16/4488;;C23C16/45578;;C23C16/00;;C23C16/401;;C23C16/45578;;C23C16/4488,C30B25/08;;H01L21/205,,0,0,,,,PENDING

In one application, a tuning circuit outside of the main signal path is used to tune each biquadratic filter section of the main signal path. In another application, each filter section along the main signal path has a biquadratic filter that can oscillate and corresponding tuning elements that enable the filter section to tune itself. According to certain embodiments of the present invention, a biquadratic filter is made to oscillate by applying a common-mode voltage signal to the inputs of the filter's third transconductor cell to make the cell's transconductance go to zero.

The diffuser case has passageways for diffused air that connect a diffused air region to a manifold. At least one orifice is located at the end of each of the passageways in the diffused air region. The size of the orifices controls the amount of air that is discharged from the diffused air region to the manifold. Diffused compressor air collects in the manifold and is then extracted from the manifold as needed for engine or service applications. The size and location of the orifices in the diffuser radially and circumferentially control the rate of discharge of the diffused air from the diffuser before the air enters the combustor region.

    Apparatus and techniques for awakening bus circuitry from an inactive state as needed are described. The bus circuitry forms part of a computer system and is placed in the inactive state (i.e., shut down) when not needed so as to conserve power. The bus circuitry is associated with a bus and can be awakened out of the inactive state when certain bus events, including resume, connect or disconnect, occur on the bus. The invention is particularly advantageous for computing devices (e.g., portable computers, desktop computers, server computers) where it is desirous to shut down bus circuitry as well as other circuitry (e.g., microprocessor) when not needed so as to reduce power consumption.

   Apparatus and techniques for awakening bus circuitry from an inactive state as needed are described. The bus circuitry forms part of a computer system and is placed in the inactive state (i.e., shut down) when not needed so as to conserve power. The bus circuitry is associated with a bus and can be awakened out of the inactive state when certain bus events, including resume, connect or disconnect, occur on the bus. The invention is particularly advantageous for computing devices (e.g., portable computers, desktop computers, server computers) where it is desirous to shut down bus circuitry as well as other circuitry (e.g., microprocessor) when not needed so as to reduce power consumption.
