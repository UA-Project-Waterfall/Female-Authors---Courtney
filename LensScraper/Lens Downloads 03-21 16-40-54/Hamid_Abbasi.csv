The terminations are curved to define a convex profile that extends from a root to a crest of the threads at said face of said self-tapping flute. The curved terminations tend to push soft tissue aside as opposed to slicing or tearing through the soft tissue, so that the self-tapping flute is less likely to slice into vascular vessels. The distal portion of the pedicle screw may also include depressions that reduce the circumferential contact area of the pedicle screw in the direction of rotation, which increases the applied pressure to the soft tissue for a given applied rotational force.

   A method for high temperature process control in which the surface emission intensity of a surface is measured at two near-infrared wavelengths over an array of points covering a fill field of view. The emissivity variable is removed from the temperature calculation and the surface emission intensity measurements are digitally processed, resulting in generation of a color temperature map. The color temperature map is processed in a thermal imaging control algorithm process, producing control output signals, which are then input to a temperature control means for controlling the surface temperature. The apparatus used in carrying out this method is surface temperature monitoring system which includes a multiple-wavelength, near-infrared thermal imaging system.

The fuel or fuel/recirculated gas mixture is supplied into the combustion chamber to create substoichiometric conditions for NOx reduction and nitrogen bearing compounds decomposition. Overfire air is supplied into the combustion chamber above the substoichiometric zone for thorough mixing and at least partial burnout of combustibles contained within the waste/fuel combustion products.",INST GAS TECHNOLOGY,KHINKIS MARK J;;ABBASI HAMID A;;LISAUSKAS ROBERT A;;ITSE DANIEL C,,https://lens.org/020-529-543-628-562,Granted Patent,no,0,0,12,14,0,F23G5/14;;F23G5/14;;F23G5/002;;F23G5/002;;F23G2900/00001;;F23G2900/00001;;F23L9/02;;F23L9/02,F23G5/00;;F23G5/14;;F23G5/50;;F23L9/02,D41100002    M,0,0,,,,EXPIRED
