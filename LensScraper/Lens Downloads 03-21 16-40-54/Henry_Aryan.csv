The invention also includes methods using the adjustable intervertebral shaver to surgically prepare the intervertebral space. By changing the width of the blade portion, the surgeon adjusts the aggressiveness of the curetting and also determines the appropriate size for an intervertebral graft. By remaining in the disc space, this decreases the time it may take to appropriately prepare the disc space. In addition, since the blade portion remains in the disc space it reduces the number of times an instrument must be passed adjacent to nerves and neural elements, thus decreasing the likelihood of damage to these structures.

The query vector is inputted into a reaction query generator model thereby obtaining a first reaction type and a first plurality of reactants. A synthon is determined for each reactant by inputting the reactant into a synthon query generator model. A set of synthons is therefore determined, each corresponding to a reactant in the first plurality of reactants. A molecular structure in the combinatorial synthesis library is identified that includes the set of synthons arranged in accordance with a synthesis rule associated with the first reaction type.",ATOMWISE INC,PEDAWI ARYAN;;VAN DEN BEDEM HENRY;;CHANG CHAOYI;;ANDERSON BRANDON;;GNIEWEK PAWEL,,https://lens.org/119-516-375-635-639,Patent Application,yes,6,0,1,1,0,C40B60/02;;C40B60/14;;C12N15/1089;;G06N3/048;;G06N3/084;;G06N3/042,C40B50/00;;C40B60/02;;C40B60/14;;G06N99/00,,0,0,,,,PENDING
