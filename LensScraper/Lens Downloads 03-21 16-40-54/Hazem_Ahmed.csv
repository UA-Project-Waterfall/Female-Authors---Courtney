Unlike pixel-based characterizations, POIs are characterized using topological features indicative of quantized values and dimensional features indicative of analog values. For example, an edge may be characterized using a set of relations, which characterizes corners and polygons (including the polygon on which the POI resides and external polygons). In turn, the set of relations may be used to define image representations, including images in different directions relative to the POI (including cardinal and ordinal image).

Determining C(x, y) at each selected pixel (x, y) includes determining n vertical convolutions, wherein each vertical convolution is equal to a scalar product of F and v(y) in a kernel space surrounding (x,y), forming an array (V) from the n vertical convolutions, and computing C(x,y) as a scalar product of V and a constant horizontal vector (H) formed from h(x).

Semiconductor layout designs are a representation of an integrated circuit that are used to manufacture the integrated circuit. Parts of the layout design, such as points of Interest (POIs), may be subject to analysis with regard to a downstream application, such as hotspot detection. Unlike pixel-based characterizations, POIs are characterized using topological features indicative of quantized values and dimensional features indicative of analog values. For example, an edge may be characterized using a set of relations, which characterizes corners and polygons (including the polygon on which the POI resides and external polygons). In turn, the set of relations may be used to define image representations, including images in different directions relative to the POI (including cardinal and ordinal image).

Tree nodes and leaves are uniformly sampled at random to estimate the corresponding work (such as node counts and leave work). This is done through novel uniform node sample and weighted random depth probing. A linear workload mapping then maps subtrees into sub-intervals of a one-dimensional interval. Such mapping facilities inverse mapping of the estimated workload to achieve efficient partitioning of the tree. The process further adaptively decides upon subtrees to sample allowing for matching with the characteristics of input trees, decreasing the number of probes, while resulting in accurate load-balancing. The process provides for fast load balancing for complex tree-based applications by exploiting statistical random sampling and requires only modest memory resources for such process making it suitable and applicable to even modest embedded devices. A significant speedup in processing is achieved which increases with the number of available processors.",EGYPT JAPAN UNIV OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,ELMAHDY AHMED HAZEM MOHAMED RASHID;;IBRAHIM OSAMA TALAAT ABDEL-HAFIZ,EGYPT-JAPAN UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (2016-10-09),https://lens.org/033-501-750-415-444,Patent Application,yes,0,3,1,1,0,G06F9/505;;G06F9/505,G06F9/50,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED
