In some aspects, an anomaly detection schedule may be determined for monitoring time series data to detect anomalies based on a data ingestion interval. A plurality of anomaly detection events may be sequentially generated and stored in an event queue at times specified by the anomaly detection schedule. The anomaly detection events may then be processed sequentially from the event queue to trigger execution of a plurality of anomaly detection workflow tasks at the times specified by the anomaly detection schedule. In some cases, execution of individual anomaly detection workflow tasks causes individual portions of time series data to be obtained from a customer data source and processed by an anomaly detection model to detect anomalies in the time series data.",AMAZON TECH INC,AZAM MOHAMMED TALAL YASSAR;;HAMED AHMED GAMAL;;ADNAN MOHAMMAD,AMAZON TECHNOLOGIES INC (2021-09-28),https://lens.org/072-710-343-153-569,Granted Patent,yes,4,0,1,1,0,G06F17/18;;G06N3/0464;;G06N3/088;;G06N3/09;;G06F16/2365,G06F16/23,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
